      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **Right leg pain and swelling**: The chief complaint and HPI describe \"right leg pain\" and \"diffuse leg swelling from the knee downwards.\" This is a primary symptom and finding. The pain is described as an ache, worse with standing/walking, and resolved when not putting weight on it. The swelling is diffuse. These symptoms are consistent with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but the patient denies a history of DVT/PE or trauma. Given the context of diabetes and the chronic nature of the symptoms, PAD is a strong consideration. However, the swelling is also a significant finding. The presence of swelling, especially in the context of chronic leg pain, could also be related to venous insufficiency or other vascular issues. The patient's history of DMT2 and hyperlipidemia further supports vascular disease as a potential cause. Therefore, the most appropriate code for the right leg pain and swelling is **I82.810 (Other specified peripheral vascular disease, unspecified leg)**. This code covers peripheral vascular disease affecting the leg, which is a common complication of diabetes and hyperlipidemia.\n",
      "2.  **Weight loss**: The patient reports \"lost 40lb in the past several months.\" This is a significant finding and is explicitly stated to be \"from his high blood sugars.\" This indicates that the weight loss is a direct consequence of his uncontrolled diabetes. The patient also mentions that he \"was told this is from his high blood sugars.\" Therefore, the most appropriate code for this is **E08.31 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state)**. This code specifically indicates uncontrolled diabetes with severe hyperglycemia, which is a direct cause of significant weight loss.\n",
      "3.  **Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2)**: The patient's PMH explicitly states \"DMT2.\" This is a chronic condition and must be coded. The patient also mentions that he \"was told this is from his high blood sugars,\" further supporting the diagnosis. The patient's last HbA1c was 17.7, which is extremely high and indicates severe uncontrolled diabetes. Therefore, the most appropriate code for this is **E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)**. This code represents the underlying diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n",
      "4.  **Hypertension**: The patient's PMH explicitly states \"hypertension.\" This is a chronic condition and must be coded. The most appropriate code for this is **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**.\n",
      "5.  **Hyperlipidemia**: The patient's PMH explicitly states \"hyperlipidemia.\" This is a chronic condition and must be coded. The most appropriate code for this is **E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**.\n",
      "6.  **Non-adherence to insulin therapy**: The patient states that he \"stopped taking his insulin several months ago\" and \"has not taken his medications for the past 6 months.\" This is a significant factor in his uncontrolled diabetes and the development of severe hyperglycemia. The most appropriate code for this is **Z91.81 (Nonadherence to prescribed regimen)**.\n",
      "7.  **Severe hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar)**: The patient's coworker reported that his blood sugar was \"found to be ~600\" and his last HbA1c was 17.7. These are extremely high values, indicating severe hyperglycemia. The patient also mentions that he \"was told this is from his high blood sugars.\" The most appropriate code for this is **E08.31 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state)**, which already covers the severe hyperglycemia as a complication of uncontrolled diabetes.\n",
      "8.  **Mild chest pain**: The patient reports \"some mild chest pain on the right side which comes and goes.\" This is a symptom that could be related to various conditions, including musculoskeletal issues, gastrointestinal problems, or even cardiac issues. However, given the context of the patient's other symptoms and the fact that it is \"mild\" and \"comes and goes,\" it is not sufficient to code for a specific cardiac diagnosis. The most appropriate code for this is **R07.89 (Other specified chest pain)**.\n",
      "9.  **Non-adherence to other medications**: The patient states that he \"has continued to take his metformin and glipizide, as well as one additional medication (he is not sure which one).\" This indicates that he is not adhering to all of his prescribed medications, which is a significant factor in his uncontrolled diabetes. The most appropriate code for this is **Z91.81 (Nonadherence to prescribed regimen)**, which is already used for non-adherence to insulin therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient presents with right leg pain and swelling, significant weight loss, and a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has a history of non-adherence to his insulin therapy and other medications, leading to severe hyperglycemia. The right leg symptoms are likely due to peripheral vascular disease, a common complication of diabetes. The weight loss is a direct consequence of his uncontrolled diabetes. The mild chest pain is a non-specific symptom that is not sufficient to code for a specific cardiac diagnosis.\n",

      "1.  **C269 (Malignant neoplasm of other specified sites):** The patient has a history of \"metastatic colorectal cancer,\" which is a malignant neoplasm. While \"C269\" is a general code for \"Malignant neoplasm of other specified sites,\" it is appropriate for a patient with a history of metastatic colorectal cancer, especially if the primary site is not specified in the HPI.\n",
      "2.  **Z85.3 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of digestive organs):** This code is used to indicate a personal history of a malignant neoplasm of the digestive organs, which is directly supported by the patient's \"h/o metastatic colorectal cancer.\"\n",
      "3.  **Z86.718 (Personal history of other specified adverse effects of drugs and medicaments):** The patient has a history of an adverse reaction to oxaliplatin, which is an adverse effect of a drug. This code captures that personal history.\n",
      "4.  **Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This code is used to indicate a personal history of other specified conditions. In this case, it can be used to capture the patient's history of \"depression\" and \"HTN (hypertension).\"\n",

      "6.  **Z87.891 and Z87.898 are both used to capture the patient's history of depression and HTN.** However, since the patient's HPI only explicitly mentions \"depression\" and \"HTN\" as part of their history, and not as current conditions, it is more appropriate to use Z87.891 for \"depression\" and Z87.898 for \"HTN.\" However, in some coding systems, Z87.891 and Z87.898 may be used together to capture multiple personal history conditions. The provided answer uses both, which is acceptable if the coding system allows for multiple Z87.89 codes to represent different conditions.\n",

      "2.  **Alcoholic hepatitis (History of Present Illness):** The patient has \"severe alcoholic hepatitis\" and \"etoh cirrhosis.\" This is a chronic condition, so **K7030** (Alcoholic hepatitis, unspecified) is appropriate.\n",

      "7.  **Hyponatremia (History of Present Illness):** The patient has \"severe hyponatremia.\" This is a direct finding, so **E875** (Hypoalbuminemia) is also relevant, as hypoalbuminemia can contribute to hyponatremia. However, **E875** is more specific for hypoalbuminemia, while **E875** is for hyponatremia. Wait, this is a mistake. The correct code for hyponatremia is **E875** (Hyponatremia), not E875.

      "1.  **Dysuria (Chief Complaint):** The patient's primary complaint is persistent dysuria, which is a symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI). This is supported by the history of being seen by his primary care physician for this symptom and being started on ciprofloxacin, as well as the nephrology follow-up where a UTI was suspected due to persistent dysuria. The patient also denies any other significant symptoms, and the labs were notable for Hb stable around 9 from prior, otherwise unremarkable. The patient was given IV antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and CefTazidime) in the ED, indicating a confirmed or strongly suspected UTI. Therefore, the appropriate ICD-10 code for a UTI is **N390** (Urinary tract infection, site not specified).\n",
      "2.  **Recent Femorofemoral Bypass:** The patient's past medical history includes a recent femorofemoral bypass. This is a significant surgical procedure, and while it's not a current acute issue, it's a relevant part of the patient's medical history. The appropriate ICD-10 code for a history of a femorofemoral bypass is **Z87821** (Personal history of other specified vascular procedures).\n",
      "3.  **Complex Repair of Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm:** The patient had a recent admission for a complex repair of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a major surgical procedure, and while it's not a current acute issue, it's a relevant part of the patient's medical history. The appropriate ICD-10 code for a history of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair is **Z87822** (Personal history of other specified vascular procedures).\n",
      "4.  **Acute Renal Failure due to ATN (Acute Tubular Necrosis):** The patient's hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure due to ATN requiring temporary hemodialysis with CVVH. This is a significant past medical condition. The appropriate ICD-10 code for a history of acute renal failure due to ATN is **Z87823** (Personal history of other specified vascular procedures). However, it's important to note that the patient was seen in follow-up by nephrology on ___ and thought to have a UTI due to persistent dysuria. This suggests that the acute renal failure due to ATN is a resolved past condition, and the current UTI is a separate issue. Therefore, the appropriate ICD-10 code for a history of acute renal failure due to ATN is **Z87823** (Personal history of other specified vascular procedures).\n",
      "5.  **Hemodialysis (CVVH):** The patient required temporary hemodialysis with CVVH. This is a significant past medical condition. The appropriate ICD-10 code for a history of hemodialysis is **Z9982** (Dependence on dialysis).\n",
      "6.  **Generalized Fatigue:** The patient reports having some generalized fatigue. This is a general symptom that can be associated with various conditions, including the recent surgical procedures, the UTI, and the history of acute renal failure. The appropriate ICD-10 code for generalized fatigue is **R5381** (Fatigue, unspecified).\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient has a history of a recent femorofemoral bypass, a complex repair of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, and acute renal failure due to ATN requiring temporary hemodialysis. He is currently presenting with persistent dysuria, which is a symptom of a UTI, and reports some generalized fatigue.\n",

      "1.  **Subdural Hematoma (Chief Complaint and Major Surgical Procedure):** The patient's chief complaint is \"Subdural hematoma,\" and the major surgical procedure performed was \"Bilateral burr holes for evacuation of subdural hematoma.\" This directly points to the diagnosis of **I62.01 (Subdural hematoma, acute, with loss of consciousness)**. The \"acute\" aspect is implied by the need for surgical evacuation and the presentation with worsening symptoms.\n",
      "2.  **Down Syndrome (Chronic Condition):** The patient's history explicitly states \"Down Syndrome,\" which is a chronic genetic disorder. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this is **Q90.9 (Down syndrome, unspecified)**.\n",
      "3.  **Hyponatremia (Chronic Condition):** The patient has \"chronic hyponatremia\" mentioned in the history. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this is **E87.1 (Hyponatremia, unspecified)**.\n",
      "4.  **Lethargy (Symptom):** The patient presented with \"several weeks of lethargy\" and \"worsening lethargy.\" The appropriate ICD-10 code for this symptom is **R40.0 (Lethargy)**.\n",
      "5.  **Incontinence (Symptom):** The patient is described as \"incontinent\" upon re-presentation. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this symptom is **R32.9 (Urinary incontinence, unspecified)**.\n",
      "6.  **Non-ambulatory (Symptom):** The patient is \"non-ambulatory\" upon re-presentation. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this symptom is **R63.4 (Nonambulatory status)**.\n",
      "7.  **Pneumonia (Past Medical History):** The patient was \"hyponatremic to 126\" and \"CXR at that time was concerning for pneumonia\" leading to \"empiric antibiotics.\" Although the repeat CXR was clear and antibiotics were discontinued, the history of pneumonia is relevant. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this is **J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism)**.\n",
      "8.  **Nonverbal (Status):** The patient is \"currently nonverbal\" and \"usually minimally conversant at baseline.\" The appropriate ICD-10 code for this status is **R48.81 (Nonverbal communication disorder)**.\n",
      "9.  **Allergies (Adverse Drug Reaction):** The patient has allergies to \"carbamazepine / ranitidine / Erythromycin Base / Tegretol.\" The appropriate ICD-10 code for an allergy is **Z88.01 (Allergy to anticonvulsants), Z88.02 (Allergy to antacids), Z88.03 (Allergy to antibiotics), Z88.04 (Allergy to anticonvulsants)**. However, since the patient is nonverbal and the specific drug causing the reaction is not specified, a more general code for an allergy is **Z88.0 (Allergy to other specified drugs)**. This code is more appropriate for a patient with multiple unspecified drug allergies, especially when the specific drug causing the reaction is not clear from the provided information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient's ICD-10 codes should include the primary diagnosis for the subdural hematoma, the chronic conditions of Down Syndrome and hyponatremia, the symptoms of lethargy, incontinence, and non-ambulatory status, the past medical history of pneumonia, the nonverbal status, and the allergy to unspecified drugs.\n",

      "2.  **Loss of motion of R ankle (History of Present Illness):** The patient's main complaint is the inability to move his right ankle, indicating a musculoskeletal injury. This is best captured by \"Unspecified sprain of right ankle, initial encounter\" (S93909A), as the specific type of injury (sprain, fracture, etc.) is not explicitly stated, but the loss of motion suggests a significant injury.\n",

      "6.  **Cocaine binge (History of Present Illness):** The patient reports a cocaine binge, which is a specific event related to his cocaine use. The code for \"Cocaine abuse, uncomplicated\" (F14200) is appropriate for this acute episode.\n",
      "7.  **Pain (History of Present Illness):** The patient reports \"not that bad\" pain, which is a common symptom. The code for \"Pain, unspecified\" (R519) is used to capture this general complaint.\n",

      "1.  **G4P0212 (Gravida 4, Para 0212):** This indicates the patient is a woman who has been pregnant 4 times and has had 0 full-term births, 2 preterm births, 1 miscarriage, and 2 abortions. This is a pregnancy status code, not a diagnosis, but it's essential for context.\n",
      "2.  **\"admission for cerclage placement\":** A cerclage is a surgical procedure to reinforce the cervix to prevent preterm labor. The chief complaint and major surgical procedure both indicate this procedure was performed. The ICD-10 code for a cerclage is **Z33.1** (Pregnancy complicated by other specified conditions).\n",
      "3.  **\"rescue cerclage\":** This is a type of cerclage, often performed when the cervix is already dilated or in advanced labor. It is a specific type of cerclage, but the general code **Z33.1** still applies.\n",
      "4.  **\"di/di twins\":** This indicates a twin pregnancy, specifically dizygotic (diamniotic/dichorionic) twins. The ICD-10 code for a twin pregnancy is **Z33.1** (Pregnancy complicated by other specified conditions), which is already covered by the cerclage code.\n",
      "5.  **\"planned physical-exam indicated cerclage\":** This confirms the planned nature of the cerclage, which is consistent with the chief complaint and procedure.\n",
      "6.  **\"Cervix 1.5 cm in length with funneling; on speculum exam was visually 1 cm dilated\":** This describes the current state of the cervix, indicating cervical insufficiency, which is the underlying condition necessitating the cerclage. The ICD-10 code for cervical insufficiency is **O29.81** (Cervical insufficiency).\n",
      "7.  **\"Last week on her ultrasound the cervix was 2-3 cm in length\":** This provides historical context, showing a shortening of the cervix over time, supporting the diagnosis of cervical insufficiency.\n",
      "8.  **\"Reports mild intermittent cramping today; denies contractions. No VB, LOF or change in vaginal discharge. Normal FM x 2\":** These are symptoms and findings related to the current pregnancy. The absence of contractions, vaginal bleeding, or lochia, and normal fetal movements, indicate that the patient is not in active labor or experiencing other acute complications at the time of admission. These findings do not directly correspond to specific ICD-10 codes for the admission diagnosis but are important for the overall clinical picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The primary ICD-10 codes for this patient's admission are for the twin pregnancy complicated by cervical insufficiency, which necessitated a rescue cerclage. The patient's history of previous pregnancies and the current symptoms are relevant to the overall management but do not directly correspond to additional ICD-10 codes for the admission diagnosis.\n",

      "    *   **I60.9 (Cerebral infarction, unspecified):** While the HPI states \"intraparenchymal hemorrhage,\" it's important to note that the patient was \"found wandering around his apartment building shirtless and confused.\" This presentation could be consistent with a stroke (cerebral infarction) as a differential diagnosis, even if the final diagnosis was hemorrhage. Including this code acknowledges the initial consideration of stroke as a cause of altered mental status and confusion.\n",

      "2.  **I219 (Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified):** The patient's history includes \"recent admission ___ for VT ablation which was unsuccessful.\" While the primary reason for admission was VT ablation, the presence of an ICD for primary prevention and the patient's overall cardiac history (including \"non-infarct related CMP\") makes it plausible that an acute myocardial infarction could have occurred or been a contributing factor to the cardiac instability, even if not explicitly stated as the primary diagnosis for the current admission.\n",
      "3.  **I489 (Unspecified arrhythmia):** The patient has a history of \"recent admission ___ for VT ablation which was unsuccessful.\" This directly indicates an arrhythmia, specifically ventricular tachycardia (VT), which is a type of arrhythmia.\n",

      "6.  **I5040 (Acute diastolic (congestive) heart failure, unspecified):** The patient's \"shortness of breath\" at rest, \"hypotension,\" and \"presyncope\" in the setting of \"increased diuretic doses\" could also indicate an acute diastolic heart failure event, especially if the ejection fraction (EF) is preserved or if there is a component of diastolic dysfunction contributing to the acute presentation.\n",
      "7.  **I509 (Heart failure, unspecified):** This is a general code for heart failure that can be used when the specific type (systolic, diastolic, acute on chronic) is not specified or when multiple types are present.\n",

The patient's history of cancer (Z85811, Z85821, Z87891) and the increased diuretic dose (K521) are also relevant to the current presentation. The \"recent admission ___ for VT ablation which was unsuccessful\" indicates a history of arrhythmia (I489, R0789, R0989). The \"presyncope\" and \"hypotension\" (I959, R0989) are direct symptoms. The \"shortness of breath\" at rest (I5020, I5030, I5040, I509, J980) is a key symptom of heart failure. The \"increased diuretic doses\" (K521) and \"presyncope\" (R0989) are contributing factors. The \"non-infarct related CMP\" (I110, I5020, I509) and \"ICD for primary prevention\" (I489, I959) are chronic conditions. The \"recent discovery of lung nodules\" (Z85821, Z87891) and \"metastatic papillary thyroid cancer\" (Z85811) are personal history codes. The \"presyncope\" (R0989) is a direct symptom. The \"hypotension\" (I959, R0989) is a direct finding. The \"shortness of breath\" (I5020, I5030, I5040, I509, J980) is a direct symptom.

      "2.  **Nausea and Vomiting (R1110):** The chief complaint explicitly states \"nausea/vomiting,\" and the patient reports \"continued restlessness at home\" and \"able to tolerate liquids but no solids.\"\n",
      "3.  **Abdominal Pain (R109):** The chief complaint explicitly states \"abdominal pain,\" and the patient reports \"increased abdominal pain\" and \"continued restlessness at home.\"\n",
      "4.  **Hypertension (I10):** The patient's history includes \"HTN.\"\n",

      "7.  **Elevated AST and ALT (R7402):** The lab results show \"AST 65\" and \"ALT 54,\" which are elevated.\n",
      "8.  **Mild Headache (R610):** The patient reports \"a mild headache\" on arrival to the floor.\n",
      "9.  **Guarding and Rebound Tenderness (R109):** The physical exam in the ED notes \"+ guarding in LUQ and RUQ; + rebound tenderness,\" which are signs of abdominal pain and inflammation.\n",
      "10. **Simple Cystic Structure in Left Adnexa (N8781):** The CT scan notes \"5.3 cm left adnexal cystic structure appears simple,\" which is a finding of a simple cyst in the left ovary.\n",
      "11. **Steatosis (K7601):** The RUQ US with \"steatosis\" indicates fatty infiltration of the liver.\n",
      "12. **Dehydration (E869):** The patient was given 2L NS and 2L LR in the ED, indicating fluid resuscitation for dehydration, which is a common complication of acute pancreatitis and vomiting.\n",
      "13. **Acute Kidney Injury (N179):** The patient's sodium level is \"Na 132,\" which is low, and she received 2L NS and 2L LR, suggesting fluid overload. However, the presence of \"lactate 2.2\" and \"elevated lipase\" could also indicate systemic inflammation and potential renal impairment. Given the context of acute pancreatitis and fluid resuscitation, acute kidney injury is a plausible complication.\n",
      "14. **Hypotension (I959):** The patient's vitals prior to transfer show \"153/96,\" which is a significant drop from \"130/70\" in the ED, indicating hypotension.\n",
      "15. **Tachycardia (I471):** The patient's heart rate was \"118\" in the ED and \"77\" prior to transfer, but the initial presentation of \"118\" and the context of acute pancreatitis and dehydration suggest tachycardia as a compensatory response.\n",

      "1.  **Chronic lower extremity ischemia (LLE):** The patient has a history of chronic LLE ischemia with multiple revascularization attempts, including bypasses and angioplasties. This is a chronic condition, so the appropriate code is **I7020** (Chronic arterial insufficiency of lower extremity, unspecified).\n",
      "2.  **Acute onset of spasm-like pain on the left foot:** This is a transient symptom, likely related to the underlying chronic ischemia or a new acute event. The most specific code for this acute pain is **R208** (Other specified pain in limb).\n",
      "3.  **Left lower extremity edema and redness:** The patient presents with \"LLE edema and transient foot pain\" and \"slight swelling of her left foot and redness in her left foot.\" These are acute symptoms. The code **I8789** (Other specified disorders of veins) is appropriate for acute venous issues, but since the primary issue is arterial, **I8789** is still used for unspecified venous disorders. However, **I8789** is not the best fit for acute edema and redness in the context of chronic arterial disease. A more appropriate code for acute edema and redness in the lower extremity, especially in the context of chronic arterial disease, is **I8789** (Other specified disorders of veins) or **I8789** (Other specified disorders of veins) if venous issues are suspected. However, given the context of chronic arterial disease and the transient nature of the symptoms, **I8789** is still the most appropriate code for the acute presentation.\n",
      "4.  **History of multiple revascularization attempts (L fem-BK pop L GSV bypass, thrombolysis, angioplasty, covered stent placement):** These are past procedures. The appropriate code for a history of bypass graft is **Z9581** (Presence of other specified vascular grafts). The history of thrombolysis and angioplasty is part of the chronic condition and would be included in the chronic arterial insufficiency code **I7020**.\n",
      "5.  **History of Factor V Leiden and hypercoagulability in family, negative for anticardiolipin and anti B2 macroglobulin antibodies:** This is a history of a genetic condition. The appropriate code is **Z8671** (Family history of thrombophilia).\n",
      "6.  **Use of Plavix and Xarelto:** These are medications for anticoagulation. The appropriate code for the use of anticoagulants is **Z7901** (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants).\n",
      "7.  **History of osteoporosis:** The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which is a chronic condition. The appropriate code is **M819** (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture).\n",
      "8.  **History of hypertension:** The patient has a history of hypertension, which is a chronic condition. The appropriate code is **I10** (Essential (primary) hypertension).\n",
      "9.  **History of chronic anemia:** The patient has a history of chronic anemia, which is a chronic condition. The appropriate code is **D509** (Anemia, unspecified).\n",
      "10. **History of ataxia:** The patient has a history of ataxia, which is a chronic neurological condition. The appropriate code is **R270** (Ataxia).\n",
      "11. **History of falls:** The patient has a history of falls, which is a common comorbidity in elderly patients. The appropriate code is **Y92099** (Unspecified place of occurrence).\n",
      "12. **Allergies to various medications:** The patient has multiple allergies, which are documented. The appropriate code for each allergy is **Z88510** (Allergy to aspirin), **Z88511** (Allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics), **Z88512** (Allergy to anti-inflammatory/antiarthritic agents), **Z88513** (Allergy to estrogen preparations), **Z88514** (Allergy to opioids), **Z88515** (Allergy to bisphosphonates), **Z88516** (Allergy to antiemetics), **Z88517** (Allergy to antidepressants), **Z88518** (Allergy to other specified drugs), and **Z88519** (Allergy to other specified drugs). However, since the patient has multiple allergies, it's more efficient to use **Z88510** (Allergy to aspirin) and **Z88511** (Allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics) for the most common and severe allergies, and **Z88518** (Allergy to other specified drugs) for the remaining allergies.\n",

      "   - The chief complaint is \"Abnormal eye movements,\" and the history of present illness (HPI) mentions \"right eye deviation\" and \"right eye blurry vision\" for 1-1 month, with an exam \"concerning for an INO lesion.\" This strongly suggests a diagnosis of **Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO)**, which is a neurological condition affecting eye movement. The ICD-10 code for this is **G43.819** (Other specified transient cerebral ischemic attacks, unspecified).\n",
      "   - The patient has a history of \"pituitary macroadenoma s/p resection via craniotomy and radiation complicated by intracranial hemorrhage in ___.\" This indicates a **history of intracranial hemorrhage**, which is a significant past medical condition. The ICD-10 code for this is **I60.9** (Intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified).\n",
      "   - The patient has a history of \"bilateral ACA ischemic strokes.\" This is a **history of cerebral infarction (stroke)**. The ICD-10 code for this is **I63.9** (Cerebral infarction, unspecified).\n",
      "   - The patient has a \"seizure disorder.\" This is a **history of epilepsy**. The ICD-10 code for this is **G40.909** (Epilepsy, unspecified, without status epilepticus).\n",
      "   - The patient has \"hypopituitarism\" and \"diabetes insipidus.\" These are **endocrine disorders**. The ICD-10 code for hypopituitarism is **E23.9** (Hypopituitarism, unspecified), and for diabetes insipidus, it is **E22.0** (Central diabetes insipidus).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Other Conditions:**\n",
      "   - The patient has \"right eye blurry vision\" and \"right eye feels scratchy.\" These are **eye symptoms**. The ICD-10 code for \"Other specified visual disturbances\" is **H53.819** (Other specified visual disturbances, right eye).\n",
      "   - The patient has \"right eye deviation.\" This is a **visual field defect**. The ICD-10 code for this is **H53.819** (Other specified visual disturbances, right eye) or **H53.829** (Other specified visual field defects, right eye). Given the context of INO, which is a visual field defect, **H53.829** is more specific.\n",
      "   - The patient has \"history of pituitary macroadenoma s/p resection via craniotomy and radiation.\" This is a **history of a brain tumor**. The ICD-10 code for this is **C75.0** (Malignant neoplasm of pituitary gland).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Summary:**\n",
      "   The patient has a complex medical history with multiple neurological and endocrine conditions, including a recent concern for INO, a history of intracranial hemorrhage, bilateral ACA strokes, seizure disorder, hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and a history of pituitary macroadenoma. He also presents with right eye deviation and blurry vision, which are symptoms consistent with INO and other visual field defects.\n",

      "4.  **Chief Complaint: worsening chronic left knee wound** - This is a primary symptom or problem. The chronic wound on the left knee is a significant medical issue. The appropriate ICD-10 code for a chronic wound of the knee is **L97.511** (for the left knee).\n",
      "5.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: left knee I&D, polyliner exchange, vac placement** - This indicates a surgical procedure performed. The appropriate ICD-10 code for a surgical debridement of a wound is **Z41.81** (for debridement of a wound, infection, or burn). The polyliner exchange and wound vac placement are part of the surgical procedure and are typically coded as part of the procedure code or as additional codes if they are significant components. However, in this context, the primary procedure is the debridement, so **Z41.81** is the most relevant.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **Larynx cancer (Chief Complaint):** The chief complaint is \"Larynx cancer,\" which directly indicates a diagnosis of cancer of the larynx. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this is **C329** (Malignant neoplasm of larynx, unspecified).\n",
      "2.  **Supraglottic SCC (History of Present Illness):** \"Supraglottic SCC\" stands for \"Supraglottic Squamous Cell Carcinoma,\" a specific type of laryngeal cancer. This is a more specific diagnosis than \"Larynx cancer\" and is also a form of \"Malignant neoplasm of larynx.\" Therefore, **C329** is still appropriate, as it is the general code for laryngeal cancer, and the specific type is noted in the HPI.\n",
      "3.  **s/p total laryngectomy (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** \"s/p total laryngectomy\" indicates the patient has undergone a total laryngectomy (removal of the entire larynx). The appropriate ICD-10 code for this procedure is **Z85821** (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of respiratory and digestive systems, larynx).\n",
      "4.  **s/p bilateral neck dissection (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** \"s/p bilateral neck dissection\" indicates the patient has undergone a bilateral neck dissection, a common procedure in the treatment of head and neck cancers. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this procedure is **Z85821** (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of respiratory and digestive systems, larynx), as it is a procedure related to the treatment of laryngeal cancer.\n",
      "5.  **s/p trach (History of Present Illness):** \"s/p trach\" indicates the patient has undergone a tracheostomy. The appropriate ICD-10 code for a tracheostomy is **Z9381** (Presence of tracheostomy tube).\n",
      "6.  **s/p tracheoscopy/bronchoscopy & trach replacement w/ 6 XLT cuffed trach (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** This indicates the patient has undergone a tracheoscopy and bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy replacement with a 6mm cuffed tracheostomy tube. The appropriate ICD-10 code for a tracheostomy replacement is **Z9381** (Presence of tracheostomy tube), and the procedure codes for tracheoscopy and bronchoscopy are **Z4581** (Encounter for other specified surgical aftercare) and **Z4582** (Encounter for other specified surgical aftercare), respectively. However, since the patient is \"s/p\" (status post) these procedures, the focus is on the current status, which is the presence of the tracheostomy tube, hence **Z9381** is the most relevant code for the current status.\n",
      "7.  **False passaged at time of clinic visit (History of Present Illness):** \"False passaged\" refers to a false passage in the tracheostomy tube, which is a complication or finding related to the tracheostomy. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this is **T8681XA** (Other specified complications of other specified surgical procedures, initial encounter), as it is a complication of the tracheostomy procedure.\n",
      "8.  **DL bx on ___ (History of Present Illness):** \"DL bx\" stands for \"Diagnostic Laryngoscopy and Biopsy,\" which is a diagnostic procedure. The appropriate ICD-10 code for this is **Z4581** (Encounter for other specified surgical aftercare), as it is a diagnostic procedure related to the management of the laryngeal cancer.\n",
      "9.  **Tracheoscopy/bronchoscopy (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** As mentioned, the patient has undergone a tracheoscopy and bronchoscopy. The appropriate ICD-10 code for these procedures is **Z4581** (Encounter for other specified surgical aftercare) and **Z4582** (Encounter for other specified surgical aftercare), respectively. However, since the patient is \"s/p\" (status post) these procedures, the focus is on the current status, which is the presence of the tracheostomy tube, hence **Z9381** is the most relevant code for the current status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient has a history of supraglottic SCC (C329) for which he has undergone a total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection (Z85821). He currently has a tracheostomy (Z9381) and has had a tracheoscopy/bronchoscopy and trach replacement. He also has a false passage in the tracheostomy tube (T8681XA) and a diagnostic laryngoscopy and biopsy (Z4581).\n",
