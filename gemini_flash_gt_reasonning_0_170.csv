1.  **Chief Complaint: ""chest pain""** and **HPI: ""chest pain last week that radiated to his back""** and **""complaints of chest pain that awoke him from sleep at 3am""**: These symptoms directly point to angina.
2.  **HPI: ""initial EKG showed Qs in V2, V3 and Trop was 1.3.""** and **""Repeat EKG revealed V2, v3, v4 elevation""**: The ST-elevation in V2, V3, V4, combined with elevated troponin, confirms an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) of the anterior wall. This is coded as I2101. The Q waves could indicate evolving MI or previous ischemia, but the acute elevation defines the current event.
3.  **HPI: ""During catheterization he was found to have multivessel disease""** and **""referred for emergent CABG""**: This indicates severe underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). Given the acute chest pain, prior chest pain and the emergent nature of CABG, this points to unstable angina as the manifestation of the severe CAD. This is coded as I25110.
4.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ""Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting x4""**: This procedure results in a new anatomical status, the presence of coronary bypass grafts. This is coded as Z951.
5.  **History of Present Illness: ""history of diabetes""**: This is coded as E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) as no specific type or complications are mentioned.
6.  **History of Present Illness: ""hyperlipidemia""**: This is coded as E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified).
7.  **History of Present Illness: ""non complaints with medications""**: This indicates patient noncompliance with medical treatment, which is a significant factor in chronic disease management. This is coded as Z9119.
8.  **Allergies: ""simvastatin / Crestor""**: These are statin medications, indicating an allergy to a drug, medicament, or biological substance. This is coded as Z888.
9.  **Allergies: ""Influenza Virus Vaccines""**: This indicates an allergy to a vaccine. This is coded as Z881.
10. **HPI: ""He described it as heartburn""**: This is a symptom reported by the patient. This is coded as R12.
11. **Chief Complaint: ""chest pain""**: While the etiology is detailed by I2101 and I25110, R074 is appropriate to capture the chief complaint as a symptom.

Summary of ICD-10 codes: The patient presented with acute anterior STEMI (I2101) due to underlying severe multivessel atherosclerotic heart disease with unstable angina (I25110). He also has a history of Type 2 diabetes (E119) and hyperlipidemia (E785), with documented noncompliance to medications (Z9119). He underwent emergent CABG, now having bypass grafts (Z951). His allergies include statins (Z888) and influenza vaccines (Z881). His presenting symptoms included chest pain (R074) and heartburn (R12).</reasoning>

ED.。請問他的 ICD10 編碼應該有哪些呢？",0.4444444444444444,1568,E1165 E785 I10 I2699 I82431 I82441 K769 R634 R918 Z6821,E1140 E1151 E1165 E785 I10 M79 R074 R2241 R634 Z7984 Z91,"<reasoning>逐步推理：
1.  **右腿疼痛 (Right leg pain)**：這是患者的主訴之一。
    *   M79.604 (Pain in right leg, unspecified)：直接對應右腿疼痛的主訴。
    *   R22.41 (Localized swelling, mass and lump, right lower limb)：病歷中提到「 diffuse leg swelling from the knee downwards」，這與右腿疼痛同時出現，應予以編碼。
2.  **體重減輕 (Weight loss)**：這是患者的另一個主訴。
    *   R63.4 (Unintentional weight loss)：患者自述「lost 40lb in the past several months」，且為非意圖性。
3.  **第二型糖尿病 (DMT2)**：患者有此既往病史，且病情嚴重失控。
    *   E11.65 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia)：病歷中提及「last hgbA1c 17.7」，「blood sugar at work, where it was found to be ~600」，以及患者停止胰島素治療，這些都指向嚴重的血糖過高狀態。
    *   E11.40 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified)：考慮到右腿疼痛和足部腫脹，且糖尿病長期失控，糖尿病神經病變是常見的併發症。
    *   E11.51 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy without gangrene)：腿部腫脹也可能是糖尿病周邊血管病變的表現。
4.  **用藥依從性問題 (Medication non-adherence)**：
    *   Z91.130 (Patient's intentional underdosing of insulin regimen)：患者自述「stopped taking his insulin several months ago」，原因為「laziness」，符合主動性地減少胰島素劑量。
    *   Z79.84 (Long-term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs)：患者表示他繼續服用二甲雙胍(metformin)和格列吡嗪(glipizide)。
5.  **其他主訴/症狀 (Other complaints/symptoms)**：
    *   R07.4 (Chest pain, unspecified)：患者報告「some mild chest pain on the right side which comes and goes」。
6.  **既往病史 (Past Medical History, PMH)**：
    *   I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)：患者有高血壓的PMH。
    *   E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)：患者有高脂血症的PMH。
