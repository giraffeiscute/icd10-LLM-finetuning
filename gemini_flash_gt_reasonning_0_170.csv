1.  **D500 (Iron deficiency anemia secondary to blood loss (chronic))**: The medical record states ""PMH significant for chronic anemia"" and laboratory results show ""H/H 7.8/25.4 (baseline Hct 31), iron studies with iron 49 ferritin 249,"" which are indicative of iron deficiency. The need for ""1u pRBC transfusion"" further supports the severity of anemia.
2.  **E538 (Deficiency of other specified B group vitamins)**: The patient was administered ""FoLIC Acid 1 mg"" in the ED, suggesting a deficiency in this B group vitamin.
3.  **H548 (Blindness, low vision of both eyes, unspecified)**: Although not explicitly stated as a chief complaint or acute finding, ""recurrent falls"" in an elderly patient can often be attributed to or exacerbated by visual impairment. Given the code is provided, it's inferred that this was part of the patient's documented medical history or contributing factors to her falls.
4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**: The patient's ""PMH significant for hypertension"" directly supports this code.
5.  **K521 (Toxic gastroenteritis and colitis)**: The patient reported taking a ""natural laxative"" which resulted in ""2 bowel movements in the morning of presentation and one episode of incontinence with diarrhea while sleeping,"" consistent with an inflammatory reaction of the gastrointestinal tract due to a toxic agent (the laxative).
6.  **M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture)**: The patient's ""PMH significant for osteoporosis"" directly supports this code, indicating the underlying bone condition. While she had an L5 fracture, M81.0 codes the chronic condition of osteoporosis itself.
7.  **R270 (Ataxia, unspecified)**: The patient's ""PMH significant for ataxia"" directly supports this code. Ataxia would also contribute to the ""recurrent falls.""
8.  **T474X5A (Adverse effect of other specified laxative, initial encounter)**: The patient's symptoms of ""diarrhea"" and ""incontinence"" directly resulted from taking a ""natural laxative,"" classifying this as an adverse effect. ""Initial encounter"" indicates the patient is receiving active treatment for the acute effect.
9.  **Y92099 (Unspecified place of occurrence, not applicable)**: The patient ""presents from home"" after feeling weak and calling EMS. Her falls occurred ""from standing,"" which implies occurring within her home environment but without a more specific location.
10. **Z9181 (History of falling)**: The medical record explicitly mentions ""recurrent falls"" and details two separate fall incidents (""s/p fall from standing at which time imaging revealed acute L5 fracture"" and ""s/p fall from standing while trying to reach for a glass of water""), supporting a history of falling.

1.  **E118 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified complications):** The patient's Past Medical History (PMHx) includes ""DMII,"" which stands for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
2.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** The patient's PMHx lists ""Obesity.""
3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient's PMHx includes ""HLD,"" which stands for Hyperlipidemia.
4.  **I071 (Tricuspid insufficiency, unspecified whether acute or chronic):** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, tricuspid insufficiency is a common complication in patients with severe, chronic heart failure (such as ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%) and pulmonary hypertension (often secondary to heart failure and COPD), which are present in this patient's history. Its presence is highly plausible given the overall cardiac status.
5.  **I129 (Hypertensive heart disease without heart failure):** The patient's PMHx includes ""HTN"" (Hypertension). Given the presence of ""ischemic cardiomyopathy,"" the ""heart disease"" component of this code is appropriate, even if heart failure itself is primarily attributed to ischemia.
6.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient's PMHx states ""3 vessel CAD s/p RCA stenting."" The phrase ""denies any chest pain"" supports ""without angina pectoris.""
7.  **I255 (Ischemic cardiomyopathy):** The patient's PMHx explicitly mentions ""ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%.""
8.  **I272 (Other secondary pulmonary hypertension):** Not explicitly stated, but secondary pulmonary hypertension is a very common complication of severe, chronic left-sided heart failure (ischemic cardiomyopathy) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both of which are present in this patient. It often contributes to right heart strain and tricuspid valve issues.
9.  **I340 (Nonrheumatic mitral valve insufficiency):** Not explicitly stated, but mitral valve insufficiency (regurgitation) is a frequent complication of ischemic cardiomyopathy, where ventricular remodeling can lead to papillary muscle dysfunction and incomplete mitral valve closure. Its presence is highly probable in this clinical context.
10. **I447 (Unspecified atrioventricular block):** Not explicitly stated, but conduction system abnormalities, including AV blocks, are common in older patients with extensive coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure.
11. **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The History of Present Illness (HPI) states that dobutamine was discontinued ""due to afib and tachyarrhythmia.""
12. **I509 (Heart failure, unspecified):** The patient has ""ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%,"" ""multiple recent admissions to an OSH for heart failure recently,"" and presented with ""worsening dyspnea, shortness of breath with exertion, and lower extremity edema,"" along with an ""elevated BNP."" All these point to heart failure.
13. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** The patient's PMHx includes ""COPD.""
14. **K7200 (Acute and subacute hepatic failure without coma):** The HPI mentions ""transaminitis had developed"" in the context of cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion, indicating acute liver injury or failure.
15. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The HPI notes that ""UOP was good but then dropped off in the past couple days"" and ""UOP had decreased,"" indicating acute kidney injury or failure.
16. **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** The patient's PMHx includes ""CKD.""
17. **R570 (Cardiogenic shock):** The Chief Complaint is ""Cardiogenic shock,"" and the HPI states the patient was ""transferred to ___ in cardiogenic shock"" and ""required levophed for blood pressure support.""
18. **R7989 (Other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry):** This code can be used for ""elevated troponin to 1.23"" when an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is not definitively diagnosed or if the troponin elevation is secondary to other acute illness like shock. It's an ""abnormal finding"" that points to myocardial injury.
19. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** Given the patient's end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, and multiple severe comorbidities, palliative care is highly likely to be involved or considered, even if not explicitly stated in this brief HPI.
20. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order status):** Similar to Z51.5, for a patient with such critical and life-threatening conditions, a DNR order is a common and appropriate part of the care plan.
21. **Z9861 (Coronary angioplasty status with implant of stent):** The patient's PMHx states ""3 vessel CAD s/p RCA stenting,"" indicating a history of coronary angioplasty with stent placement.

1.  **E1121 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy):** The patient has a ""history of diabetes."" While diabetic nephropathy is not explicitly mentioned in this HPI, its presence in the ICD-10 list indicates it is a known complication associated with the patient's diabetes.
2.  **E113299 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without macular edema, unspecified eye):** The patient has a ""history of diabetes."" Similar to nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy is a common chronic complication of diabetes, and its inclusion implies it's part of the patient's existing medical record.
3.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** The patient has a ""history of diabetes"" and is ""non complaints with medications."" Non-compliance often leads to poor glycemic control, including hyperglycemia.
4.  **E7800 (Pure hypercholesterolemia, unspecified):** The patient has a ""history of hyperlipidemia."" This code specifies pure hypercholesterolemia, a common type of hyperlipidemia.
5.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has a ""history of hyperlipidemia."" This is a broader code used when the specific type of hyperlipidemia is not further specified in the immediate documentation or when multiple types are present.
6.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Although not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, psychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder are often co-morbidities, especially in patients with multiple chronic illnesses and can contribute to medication non-compliance (""non complaints with medications""). This code would be derived from the patient's full medical history.
7.  **G5601 (Carpal tunnel syndrome, right wrist):** This condition is not mentioned in the HPI but would be part of the patient's comprehensive past medical history.
8.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with (congestive) heart failure):** The patient has a ""history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia,"" which are significant risk factors for hypertension. The presence of ""multivessel disease"" and acute MI, combined with ""I5021"" (Heart Failure), suggests underlying hypertensive heart disease contributing to the cardiac issues.
9.  **I213 (ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of other anterior site):** The ""Chief Complaint: chest pain"" and HPI details ""initial EKG showed Qs in V2, V3 and Trop was 1.3. Repeat EKG revealed V2, v3, v4 elevation and qs in V3"" are classic signs for an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically in an anterior location.
10. **I25119 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris):** The patient presented with ""chest pain last week that radiated to his back"" and ""chest pain that awoke him from sleep,"" progressing to an MI. ""Multivessel disease"" found during catheterization confirms atherosclerotic heart disease, and the acute, severe chest pain prior to MI fits ""unstable angina pectoris.""
11. **I340 (Nonrheumatic mitral valve insufficiency):** This is another pre-existing cardiac condition that would be documented in the patient's full medical history, likely identified during cardiac workup (e.g., echocardiogram).
12. **I5021 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** The patient's acute MI and severe ""multivessel disease"" with need for emergent CABG indicate compromised heart function. Given the history of diabetes and potential hypertension, chronic heart failure is likely, exacerbated by the acute MI.
13. **K429 (Umbilical hernia without obstruction or gangrene):** This is an incidental finding or a known history, not directly related to the acute cardiac event.
14. **M179 (Osteoarthritis, unspecified knee):** This is an incidental finding or a known history, not directly related to the acute cardiac event.
15. **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** The patient's ""chest pain last week that radiated to his back"" and ""radiated to his back and arm"" supports a diagnosis of back pain (Dorsalgia).
16. **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** As a male patient, BPH is a very common age-related condition. The ""without lower urinary tract symptoms"" suggests it's a known, asymptomatic condition.
17. **Z794 (Long-term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** The patient has a ""history of diabetes,"" implying ongoing management with medication, which typically includes oral hypoglycemic agents.
18. **Z9114 (Patient's noncompliance with other medical treatment and regimen due to personal reasons):** The HPI explicitly states the patient ""who is non complaints with medications,"" which directly maps to this code.

Summary: This male patient with a history of type 2 diabetes (with nephropathy, retinopathy, and hyperglycemia), hyperlipidemia, and probable hypertensive heart disease presented with an acute anterior STEMI due to multivessel atherosclerotic heart disease and unstable angina, leading to emergent 4-vessel CABG. He also has acute on chronic systolic heart failure, and other chronic conditions like depression, carpal tunnel syndrome, mitral valve insufficiency, umbilical hernia, osteoarthritis, dorsalgia, and BPH. He is non-compliant with his medications and uses oral hypoglycemic drugs long-term.

The provided ""History of Present Illness"" section is empty. Therefore, most of the specific chronic conditions and detailed diagnoses represented by the ICD-10 codes cannot be directly inferred from the *provided text* in the medical record snippet. However, ICD-10 codes are assigned based on the full patient medical record (including past medical history, current medications, lab results, imaging, and detailed HPI/review of systems), which is not fully available here. The inference will acknowledge the limitations of the provided record.

1.  **I25119 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris):** The Chief Complaint of ""Chest pain"" strongly suggests an underlying cardiac issue. Unstable angina pectoris (part of this code) is a common cause of chest pain and implies underlying atherosclerotic heart disease.
2.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The Chief Complaints of ""Chest pain"" and ""Abdominal pain"" are both common symptoms of Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).
3.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** Not directly inferable from the provided chief complaint or empty HPI. This code would typically be assigned based on lab results (hemoglobin/hematocrit) or a documented diagnosis from the patient's past medical history.
4.  **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with neurological complications, unspecified):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a chronic condition that would be documented in the patient's past medical history, active problem list, or through medication records (e.g., insulin use).
5.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a chronic metabolic condition, commonly found in a patient's past medical history or medication list (e.g., statin use).
6.  **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a specific electrolyte imbalance, usually identified through laboratory blood tests, and would be part of the current problem list or HPI if it were an acute issue.
7.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a psychiatric diagnosis, typically found in the patient's mental health history or assessment.
8.  **I120 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 5 chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a chronic condition, part of the patient's past medical history, indicating severe kidney damage due to hypertension.
9.  **I447 (Left bundle-branch block, unspecified):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is an electrocardiogram (EKG) finding, indicating a conduction abnormality in the heart, typically documented in EKG reports or past cardiac history.
10. **I5022 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, severe):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a chronic, severe cardiovascular condition, found in the patient's past medical history or active problem list.
11. **I69354 (Sequelae of cerebral infarction with hemiplegia and hemiparesis affecting left dominant side):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This describes residual effects from a past stroke (cerebral infarction) with specific neurological deficits, which would be detailed in the patient's past medical history or neurological assessment.
12. **N186 (End stage renal disease):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a chronic condition, often a progression from I120, indicating the most severe form of kidney failure.
13. **N289 (Disorder of kidney and ureter, unspecified):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a general code for an unspecified kidney disorder, likely from the patient's history.
14. **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a common condition in older males, typically part of their past medical history.
15. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a status code indicating current insulin therapy, usually associated with a diagnosis of diabetes (E1140).
16. **Z992 (Dependence on renal dialysis):** Not directly inferable from the provided text. This is a status code indicating that the patient is undergoing renal dialysis, directly linked to end-stage renal disease (N186).

Summary: The patient presented with chest and abdominal pain. The codes indicate a complex medical history including severe cardiovascular disease (atherosclerotic heart disease with unstable angina, severe chronic systolic heart failure, LBBB), end-stage renal disease likely due to hypertension and managed with dialysis, type 2 diabetes on insulin, hyperlipidemia, a history of stroke with residual left-sided weakness, anemia, GERD, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and major depressive disorder.

1.  **R109 (Unspecified abdominal pain):** 病人的主訴是「abdominal pain」（腹痛），病史中也多次提及「weeks of abdominal pain」（數週的腹痛）和「daily epigastric abdominal pain」（每日上腹痛），以及體格檢查發現「abdomen diffusely tender, worst in the epigric region」（腹部普遍壓痛，以上腹部最嚴重）。這些都直接支持了此代碼。
2.  **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** 病史中提到病人因「chronic abdominal pain」（慢性腹痛）而由腸胃科追蹤，且其腹痛持續「weeks」（數週）甚至數月，並被描述為「daily epigastric abdominal pain constant, radiating to back and neck」（每日持續性上腹痛，放射至背部和頸部），這表明其疼痛已達慢性程度。
3.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** 病人有「GERD」（胃食道逆流）病史。儘管病人服用omeprazole有所幫助，但近期上消化道內視鏡檢查並未顯示異常，且活檢結果為陰性，這支持了「without esophagitis」（無食道炎）的描述。
4.  **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** 病人最近有「constipation」（便秘）的症狀，並且「having to use enemas every 5 days for the past month」（過去一個月每五天需要使用灌腸劑），排便「painful and hard」（疼痛且堅硬），甚至需要「disimpact herself」（自行清除糞便），這些都指向便秘。
5.  **K602 (Fissure and fistula of anus and rectum, anal fistula):** 病史中明確提到病人過去曾有「perianal fistula」（肛周瘺管）。
6.  **K644 (Internal hemorrhoids with other complication):** 病人有「known hemorrhoids」（已知痔瘡），且排便時偶爾有「blood streaked」（帶血）的情況，這可以被視為痔瘡的一種併發症。
7.  **R112 (Nausea with vomiting):** 病人的腹痛伴隨有「nausea, vomiting」（噁心、嘔吐），並提到「vomiting of bilious emesis」（嘔吐膽汁）。這些症狀直接支持此代碼。
8.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure):** 病人有「HTN」（高血壓）病史。ICD-10代碼被分配意味著病人已診斷出高血壓性心臟病合併心力衰竭，儘管HPI中未詳細描述心衰症狀，但這是根據提供的ICD-10代碼集合推斷的。
9.  **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, severe):** 此代碼是I110的進一步細化，指明了心力衰竭的類型為慢性舒張性心力衰竭，且程度嚴重。這是假設已診斷出的心衰詳情。

Chief Complaint:
Right leg pain
Weight loss
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with PMH of DMT2, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, who presents with right leg pain. 
Patient states that pain began around 2 weeks ago, located in 
the
middle of his calf on his right leg. Described as an ache, that
is worse with standing or walking, and largely resolved when he
is not putting weight on it. This is associated with diffuse leg
swelling from the knee downwards. No history of DVT/PE, or other
blood clots. No history of immobilization or trauma. Also 
reports
some mild chest pain on the right side which comes and goes. No
cough or hemoptysis.

Patient notes that he has lost 40lb in the past several months.
He said he was told this is from his high blood sugars.  He 
tells
me that he stopped taking his insulin several months ago.  He
denies any reactions to insulin, instead stating that ""I think 
it
was just laziness.""  He states he has an ok appetite and no
change in bowel movements.  

Regarding his other medications, patient does state that he has
continued to take his metformin and glipizide, as well as one
additional medication (he is not sure which one).

On review of records, patient's last hgbA1c 17.7 in ___. 
At
that time, he was reportedly on lantus 26u at night as well as
metformin. He then did not return to clinic for the past several
months. Per telephone note dated ___, patient's coworker 
called
the ___ clinic to express concern as she checked his blood 
sugar
at work, where it was found to be ~600. She also reported that
patient had been losing weight, and that he had told her that he
had right leg swelling, and was not taking his medications for
the past 6 months. At this time the patient was referred to the
ED.。Please help me, using the medical record above, infer why each of this patient's ICD-10 codes was assigned. Please respond in the specified format.",1.0,3030,E1165 E785 I10 I2699 I82431 I82441 K769 R634 R918 Z6821,E1165 E785 I10 I2699 I82431 I82441 K769 R634 R918 Z6821,"<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** The patient has a ""PMH of DMT2"" and reports ""stopped taking his insulin several months ago."" His ""last hgbA1c [was] 17.7"" and his blood sugar was found to be ""~600,"" all indicating severe uncontrolled type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia.
2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This code is assigned based on the patient's ""PMH of hyperlipidemia.""
3.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This code is assigned based on the patient's ""PMH of hypertension.""
4.  **I2699 (Other pulmonary embolism without acute cor pulmonale):** The patient reports ""some mild chest pain on the right side which comes and goes."" Given his symptoms of DVT in the right leg (calf pain, swelling), a pulmonary embolism is a strong clinical suspicion, even if not fully confirmed in the provided HPI.
5.  **I82431 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of right popliteal vein):** The chief complaint includes ""Right leg pain."" The HPI describes ""pain began around 2 weeks ago, located in the middle of his calf on his right leg... associated with diffuse leg swelling from the knee downwards."" This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right leg, specifically often involving the popliteal vein.
6.  **I82441 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of right tibial vein):** Similar to I82431, the ""diffuse leg swelling from the knee downwards"" and calf pain suggest a DVT that could extend to or involve the tibial veins in the lower leg.
7.  **K769 (Liver disease, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI or PMH, severe uncontrolled diabetes and hyperlipidemia can lead to fatty liver disease (NAFLD/NASH). It's plausible this was either a known comorbidity from his full medical history or an incidental finding during the current workup that is not detailed in this specific HPI excerpt.
8.  **R634 (Unspecified sudden weight loss):** The patient explicitly ""notes that he has lost 40lb in the past several months,"" and his ""coworker also reported that patient had been losing weight."" This directly supports the code for unexplained weight loss.
9.  **R918 (Other nonlocalization of lung field without mention of tuberculosis):** The patient reported ""mild chest pain."" In the context of a suspected pulmonary embolism, imaging studies (like a chest X-ray) would be performed. This code suggests an abnormal, non-specific finding on such imaging of the lung field that is not further specified as a particular diagnosis.
10. **Z6821 (Body mass index (BMI) 20.0-20.9, adult):** The patient experienced significant weight loss (40lb). While his exact height and weight are not provided, this BMI code suggests that after the weight loss, his BMI falls into this specific range, which can be low-normal or even slightly underweight depending on his baseline, consistent with the reported weight loss.

1.  **F259 (Schizoaffective disorder, unspecified):** The patient has a ""history bipolar vs. schizoaffective disorder"" and presents with ""Agitation and psychosis,"" including ""recurrent admission to the hospital for psychosis."" This directly supports the diagnosis of a schizoaffective disorder.
2.  **F1410 (Cocaine abuse, uncomplicated):** The medical record states ""substance acute"" and describes the patient as being ""found wandering the streets naked screaming and yelling at people."" While the specific substance isn't named, this behavior is highly indicative of acute stimulant intoxication, with cocaine being a common illicit substance that can cause such a presentation.
3.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** The patient has a clear history of ""DM type II"" and has had ""elevated glucoses,"" leading to admission for ""labile glucose management."" This code specifically covers Type 2 Diabetes with the complication of hyperglycemia.
4.  **Z794 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** Given her ""DM type II"" and ongoing ""labile glucose management,"" it's highly probable she is on medication for her diabetes, including oral hypoglycemic agents.
5.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient has a history of ""CAD s/p RCA stent."" This code describes established coronary artery disease, and the ""without angina pectoris"" part aligns with her denial of chest pain on arrival.
6.  **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** This code directly corresponds to the ""s/p RCA stent"" (status post right coronary artery stent), indicating the presence of a coronary angioplasty implant.
7.  **Z86718 (Personal history of other diseases of the circulatory system):** The patient's history of ""CAD s/p RCA stent"" falls under a personal history of a circulatory system disease.
8.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Although not explicitly stated as a current diagnosis in the snippet, hypertension is a very common comorbidity with Type 2 Diabetes and Coronary Artery Disease. Its inclusion suggests it is part of her known chronic medical history.
9.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Similar to hypertension, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) is a significant risk factor for ""CAD s/p RCA stent"" and is frequently comorbid with Type 2 Diabetes. Its presence as an assigned code indicates it is part of her medical history.
10. **E8342 (Disorders of magnesium metabolism):** While not directly stated, patients with chronic conditions like Type 2 Diabetes, substance abuse, and severe mental illness (especially if off medications and poorly nourished) are at higher risk for electrolyte imbalances, including magnesium disorders.
11. **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** Similar to magnesium disorders, hyponatremia (low sodium) can occur due to various factors in this patient's presentation, including poor intake, medication non-compliance, and psychiatric conditions (e.g., psychogenic polydipsia) or general debilitation.

Summary: The patient is a female with a history of schizoaffective disorder (F259) and Type 2 Diabetes with hyperglycemia (E1165), currently on oral hypoglycemic drugs (Z794). She also has a history of Coronary Artery Disease (I2510) with a previous RCA stent (Z955, Z86718), and likely underlying hypertension (I10) and hyperlipidemia (E785). Her acute presentation involves psychosis and agitation, attributed to acute substance abuse (F1410), possibly exacerbated by medication non-compliance. Additionally, she likely has electrolyte disturbances, such as magnesium (E8342) and sodium imbalances (E871), given her complex medical and social situation.

1.  **Primary Diagnosis - Colorectal Cancer and Metastasis:**
    *   **C186 (Malignant neoplasm of descending colon):** The patient has a ""h/o metastatic colorectal cancer."" This code specifies one likely primary anatomical site of the colorectal cancer.
    *   **C187 (Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon):** Similar to C186, this code specifies another likely primary anatomical site or a more generalized involvement within the colorectal area.
    *   **C787 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile duct):** The patient has ""metastatic colorectal cancer."" The liver is a very common site for colorectal cancer metastases, directly supporting this code.

2.  **Reason for Visit and Chemotherapy-Related Issues:**
    *   **Z5111 (Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy):** The patient is ""on CapeOx"" and ""FOLFOX"" and is ""presenting for oxaliplatin desensitization."" This code captures the encounter for active chemotherapy treatment.
    *   **Z888 (Allergy to other drugs, medicaments and biological substances):** The patient has documented ""Allergies: ... oxaliplatin"" and experienced an allergic reaction with ""chills and rigors,"" ""pain in his back and chest,"" ""itching,"" and ""flushed"" during a previous infusion. The positive intradermal skin test confirms the allergy.
    *   **R6889 (Other general symptoms and signs):** This code covers the general symptoms of the allergic reaction experienced, such as ""chills and rigors,"" ""flushed,"" and ""itching.""
    *   **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** This code accounts for the ""pain in his back"" reported during the previous oxaliplatin infusion reaction.
    *   **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** Oxaliplatin is a known neurotoxic agent, and peripheral neuropathy (a type of polyneuropathy) is a common side effect of this chemotherapy. Although not explicitly stated as ""neuropathy,"" this is a highly probable complication given the treatment.
    *   **Z516 (Encounter for antineoplastic radiation therapy):** While the HPI focuses on chemotherapy, radiation therapy is a common component of comprehensive cancer treatment. This code suggests that radiation therapy is either part of the patient's current or past overall cancer management plan.

3.  **Comorbidities and Past Medical History:**
    *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Directly corresponds to the ""h/o ... HTN.""
    *   **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Directly corresponds to the ""h/o ... depression.""
    *   **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of anxiolytic, antidepressant and mood stabilizer):** The patient's history of ""depression"" implies long-term medication use for this condition, fitting this code.
    *   **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI, but obstructive sleep apnea is a common comorbidity, especially in older adults with multiple medical conditions, and would likely be part of the patient's full medical history.
    *   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI, but atrial fibrillation is a common cardiovascular comorbidity in older adults, particularly those with hypertension and other systemic illnesses, and would likely be present in the patient's complete medical record.
    *   **I714 (Abdominal aortic aneurysm, without rupture):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI, but an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a common vascular condition in older adults, especially those with hypertension, and would be part of the patient's complete medical history.
    *   **I81 (Portal vein thrombosis):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI. Portal vein thrombosis can be a complication of cancer (due to a hypercoagulable state) or liver metastasis, and could be present in the patient's history.
    *   **M1611 (Other primary osteoarthrosis, right hip):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI. Osteoarthrosis is a common degenerative joint disease in older adults, likely part of the patient's complete medical history.
    *   **Z803 (Family history of malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI, but obtaining and documenting a family history of cancer is a routine part of a cancer patient's medical record.
    *   **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This general code indicates a significant personal medical history not covered by more specific codes.

1.  **N189 (End-stage renal disease):** The patient's history explicitly states ""history of ESRD.""
2.  **M310 (Hypersensitivity angiitis and granulomatosis):** The patient's history includes ""anti-GBM disease,"" which is a type of hypersensitivity angiitis.
3.  **Z940 (Kidney transplant status):** The patient's history notes ""s/p DDRT"" (status post deceased donor renal transplant).
4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's history includes ""HTN.""
5.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient's history includes ""HLD.""
6.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** The patient has a history of ""asthma"" and presents with ""dyspnea c/w asthma exacerbation,"" uses ""inhalers,"" and received ""nebulizers.""
7.  **E8770 (Fluid overload):** The patient's chief complaint is ""lower extremity edema,"" describes ""3 lb weight gain,"" her dyspnea was ""felt to be secondary to volume overload"" in a prior admission, and she was treated with ""IV Lasix.""
8.  **J811 (Chronic pulmonary edema):** The patient's presentation with ""dyspnea and lower extremity edema,"" ""fatigue and feeling short of breath with activity,"" and a history of ""volume overload"" causing dyspnea are consistent with chronic pulmonary edema, even if the CXR was clear at the time of this admission.
9.  **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Laboratory results show ""K 5.5,"" which indicates hyperkalemia.
10. **E872 (Acidosis):** Laboratory results show ""Bicarb 13,"" which indicates metabolic acidosis.
11. **T451X5A (Adverse effect of other antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter):** The patient presented in the setting of ""supratherapeutic tacro level."" Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant, and a supratherapeutic level is considered an adverse effect. The ""A"" denotes an initial encounter.
12. **B349 (Viral infection, unspecified):** The history mentions dyspnea in a prior admission was ""possibly triggered by a viral infection.""
13. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** While the patient has ESRD, the ""supratherapeutic tacro level"" (which can be nephrotoxic) and acute electrolyte derangements (hyperkalemia, acidosis) suggest an acute worsening of renal function or acute kidney injury superimposed on her chronic ESRD.
14. **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease with no end stage renal disease):** The patient has a history of ""HTN"" and ""ESRD."" Although this code explicitly states ""no end stage renal disease,"" it is often used to capture the underlying hypertensive kidney disease that led to ESRD or the ongoing diagnosis of hypertension affecting the kidneys prior to or alongside transplant.
15. **B258 (Other cytomegaloviral diseases):** Given the patient is immunosuppressed (post-kidney transplant on tacrolimus) and has a history of a ""viral infection"" triggering symptoms, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic infection in this population. Its presence is a common inference in such clinical contexts.
16. **E559 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified):** Patients with ESRD commonly develop vitamin D deficiency due to impaired renal activation. This is a highly probable comorbidity in this patient.
17. **I2720 (Pulmonary hypertension, unspecified):** Patients with long-standing ESRD, chronic volume overload, and recurrent dyspnea are at an increased risk for developing pulmonary hypertension as a comorbidity.
18. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This general ""history of"" code is used to capture other significant past medical conditions not covered by more specific Z-codes or active diagnosis codes, reflecting the patient's overall complex medical history.

1.  **Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness - Wound Complications:**
    *   ""wound dehiscence,"" ""fluid draining from his wound,"" ""s/s drainage,"" ""increased drainage,"" ""frank dehiscence of his wound."" These statements directly support codes related to wound complications and infection.
    *   **T8131XA (Disruption of external surgical wound, not elsewhere classified, initial encounter):** This code specifically describes the ""frank dehiscence of his wound."" The ""XA"" indicates an initial encounter for the condition.
    *   **L7632 (Postprocedural infection of skin and subcutaneous tissue following other orthopedic procedure):** The drainage and dehiscence occurring after an orthopedic procedure (laminectomy/fusion) indicates a postprocedural infection.
    *   **L03221 (Cellulitis of neck):** Given the ""drainage"" and ""dehiscence"" in the ""cervical posterior spine"" area, localized inflammation/infection of the soft tissues (cellulitis) around the surgical site is a likely component.
    *   **B9689 (Other specified bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** This code is used to indicate a bacterial cause for the infection (L76.32, L03.221), even if the specific organism isn't identified in the given text.
    *   **T814XXA (Infection following a procedure, initial encounter):** This code broadly captures the ""Infection following a procedure,"" reinforcing the specific postprocedural infection. The ""XXA"" indicates an initial encounter.

2.  **Major Surgical Procedure & Postprocedural Status:**
    *   ""___ I&D CERVICAL POSTERIOR SPINE"" and ""status post posterior laminectomy C3 C4 C5 C6-C7 and laminectomy at T1, fusion C3-T1.""
    *   **Z981 (Postprocedural status, fusion of spine):** This code reflects the patient's current state having undergone a spinal fusion procedure.
    *   **Z9049 (Acquired absence of other specified organs and tissue, other acquired absence of organ and tissue):** The laminectomy procedure involves the surgical removal of the lamina, which is bone tissue. This code can be used to describe the acquired absence of this tissue due to the surgery.

3.  **External Cause and Place of Occurrence:**
    *   The complication (wound dehiscence) arose from the ""status post posterior laminectomy... fusion C3-T1."" ""Patient had been doing well post-op, was discharged from rehab 2 days ago. On ___ he noticed a small amount of fluid draining from his wound.""
    *   **Y838 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This code indicates that the surgical procedure (spinal fusion/laminectomy) was the underlying cause of the complication (dehiscence/infection).
    *   **Y92018 (Other areas of single family home as place of occurrence):** The patient noticed the drainage after being discharged from rehab, implying the onset of symptoms occurred while he was at home.

4.  **Underlying Conditions & Common Comorbidities:**
    *   ""___ male with cervical spondylosis and stenosis"" (These are the primary reasons for the prior surgery, but not directly coded in the provided list. The sequelae are).
    *   The provided medical record is focused on the acute complaint. Many codes represent chronic conditions commonly found in older patients, even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI:
        *   **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** A very common chronic condition in the adult population.
        *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Another very common chronic metabolic condition.
        *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** A widespread chronic cardiovascular condition.
        *   **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** A common pulmonary condition, especially in older adults, often related to smoking history (even if not explicitly mentioned here).
        *   **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** Could be an incidental finding, a response to stress/infection, or an underlying arrhythmia not elaborated in the HPI.
        *   **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** If the patient has Type 2 Diabetes (E11.9), long-term insulin use is a possible treatment.
        *   **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** A common history in older adults, particularly those with conditions like COPD (J44.9) or cardiovascular disease.

5.  **Less Supported/Potentially Missing Context:**
    *   **I69951 (Sequelae of unspecified cerebrovascular disease, hemiplegia and hemiparesis affecting dominant side):** There is no information in the provided HPI to support a history of cerebrovascular disease or hemiplegia. In fact, the patient states his ""hand numbness has been improving post-op,"" which contradicts new or ongoing severe neurological deficits. This code likely refers to a past medical history not detailed in the provided HPI excerpt, or it could be a miscoding.

Summary: The patient is a male status post spinal fusion who presented with a surgical wound dehiscence and infection, likely originating at home after discharge from rehab. He also carries a range of common chronic conditions (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, COPD) and a past history of nicotine dependence, which are not explicitly detailed in the present illness but are frequently coded in complex patients. One code (I69.951) appears to lack direct support in the provided HPI.

1.  **R51 (Headache):** The patient explicitly reports ""started to have a headache"" en route after the motor vehicle accident.
2.  **M542 (Cervicalgia):** The patient ""also reports neck pain,"" which is medically termed cervicalgia.
3.  **S069X9A (Unspecified intracranial injury with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, initial encounter):** The ""headache"" reported after a ""motor vehicle accident"" raises concern for a concussion or other intracranial injury. While the extent of consciousness loss is not specified in the HPI, ""X9"" allows for an unspecified duration, making this a plausible code for a head injury in this context. ""A"" indicates the initial encounter for the injury.
4.  **V4352XA (Car occupant injured in collision with car, pick-up truck or van, driver, initial encounter):** This code details the external cause of the injury. The patient is identified as a ""restrained driver"" involved in a ""motor vehicle accident"" where he ""hydroplaned,"" indicating a collision. ""A"" signifies the initial encounter.
5.  **Y92488 (Place of occurrence, street and highway, unspecified):** The ""motor vehicle accident"" where the patient ""hydroplaned"" would most commonly occur on a ""street and highway.""
6.  **Z23 (Encounter for immunization):** Although not explicitly stated in the History of Present Illness, it is a common practice for patients presenting with trauma, such as a motor vehicle accident, to receive a tetanus immunization (e.g., Tdap) if their vaccination status is unknown or outdated.

1.  **C3432 (Malignant neoplasm of lower lobe, left bronchus or lung):** This code is assigned due to the description ""LLL mass highly concerning for primary lung malignancy.""
2.  **C779 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes, unspecified):** In the context of ""end stage"" primary lung malignancy, metastatic spread to lymph nodes is highly probable and commonly coded.
3.  **D684 (Acquired coagulation factor deficiency):** This condition can be a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with malignancy or a complication of severe illness, even if not explicitly stated in this brief HPI. It suggests an underlying coagulopathy.
4.  **E8352 (Hypercalcemia):** Hypercalcemia is a known paraneoplastic syndrome, particularly in lung cancer, and would be detected via laboratory tests.
5.  **E861 (Volume depletion/Dehydration):** The patient being ""unable to participate"" and in ""end stage"" illness can lead to poor oral intake and dehydration.
6.  **F200 (Paranoid schizophrenia):** This code aligns with the history of ""psychosis"" and the listed allergies to antipsychotic medications (Thorazine, Stelazine, Haloperidol).
7.  **G8911 (Acute pain due to trauma):** This code indicates pain resulting from the recent trauma, supported by the S00xxXD and W1830XS codes describing a fall and associated injuries.
8.  **I214 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction):** Severe ""hypoxia"" (chief complaint and reason for transfer) in a patient with significant comorbidities can precipitate myocardial ischemia and NSTEMI.
9.  **I82431 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of right popliteal vein):** Patients with malignancy are at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to a hypercoagulable state and potential immobility (e.g., in rehab).
10. **J439 (Emphysema, unspecified):** This directly corresponds to the patient's diagnosis of ""end stage COPD,"" as emphysema is a primary component of COPD.
11. **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** Asthma can be a comorbidity with COPD, sometimes referred to as Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS), or could be part of the patient's past medical history.
12. **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** This code directly reflects the ""Chief Complaint: hypoxia"" and the statement ""sent over from her rehab with hypoxia.""
13. **J9602 (Acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia):** In severe acute respiratory failure, especially in a patient with end-stage COPD, both hypoxia and hypercapnia typically occur.
14. **M5430 (Sciatica, unspecified, unspecified site):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. It likely represents a chronic pain issue from the patient's complete medical history, which is not detailed in this specific admission note.
15. **N170 (Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis):** Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in severely ill patients, especially with dehydration, hypoperfusion from NSTEMI, or other systemic stressors.
16. **R578 (Other shock):** This could be related to the NSTEMI, severe hypoxia, or general decompensation in an end-stage patient, leading to insufficient tissue perfusion.
17. **R64 (Cachexia):** The term ""end stage COPD"" and ""primary lung malignancy"" strongly imply significant weight loss and muscle wasting.
18. **S0012XD (Contusion of left eyelid and periocular area, subsequent encounter):** This code indicates a contusion from a recent injury, likely a fall, given the patient was ""sent over from her rehab."" ""XD"" signifies a subsequent encounter for care after the initial injury.
19. **S0083XD (Contusion of other part of head, subsequent encounter):** Similar to S0012XD, indicating another head contusion from the same or related recent trauma, with ""XD"" for subsequent encounter.
20. **T4275XA (Adverse effect of other and unspecified antiepileptic and sedative-hypnotic drugs, initial encounter):** The patient is on antipsychotics (e.g., Thorazine, Stelazine, Haloperidol). These medications can have sedative side effects, potentially contributing to a fall (""W1830XS"") or altered mental status. ""XA"" signifies the initial encounter for this adverse effect.
21. **W1830XS (Fall on same level, from slipping, tripping and stumbling, subsequent encounter):** This external cause code identifies the mechanism of the recent fall, which resulted in the head contusions (S00xxXD codes). ""XS"" signifies a subsequent encounter for the fall.
22. **Y92122 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This indicates the location where the fall occurred, consistent with being ""sent over from her rehab.""
23. **Y92129 (Other specified health service area as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This further specifies the type of health service area, such as a rehabilitation facility, where the external cause (fall) took place.
24. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** This directly aligns with the patient being ""on hospice.""
25. **Z5329 (Encounter for other procedure or treatment not carried out because of patient decision for other reasons):** Although not explicitly detailed, the phrase ""on hospice but full code"" suggests complex discussions around goals of care and potential decisions to forgo certain treatments while still desiring full resuscitation.
26. **Z681 (Body mass index (BMI) 19.9 or less, adult):** This code is consistent with ""cachexia"" (R64) and the overall severe, end-stage condition of the patient.
27. **Z781 (Lack of physical exercise):** Inferred from the patient's overall frailty, ""unable to participate,"" and being in a rehab setting, indicating limited mobility and activity.
28. **Z8781 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This is a very common comorbidity for patients with ""COPD"" and ""primary lung malignancy.""
29. **Z87891 (Personal history of other diseases of the respiratory system):** This is a general code for other past respiratory conditions not specifically coded, which is common in patients with severe COPD.
30. **Z9181 (Personal history of falling):** This code indicates a history of falls, which explains the recent fall and associated injuries.

for which he was referred to the ED.

In the ED, initial exam was overall unremarkable. He was
afebrile, normotensive, and normoxic (92% on RA) though
desaturated requiring NC and eventually BiPAP. Labs were notable
for Hgb 17.9, proBNP 395, trop < 0.01 x2, and VBG 7.48/29. CXRs

2.  **J441 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation):** Patient has a known history of ""COPD"" and presents with ""worsening dyspnea on exertion"" and ""desaturated requiring NC and eventually BiPAP,"" necessitating bronchodilator therapy (albuterol nebs, ipratropium nebs), all indicative of an acute exacerbation.
3.  **J9621 (Acute and chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia):** Patient's ""desaturated requiring NC and eventually BiPAP"" and inability to wean from respiratory support, along with the background of COPD, indicates both acute and chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia.
4.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with (congestive) heart failure):** Patient has a history of ""HTN"" and presents with ""dyspnea on exertion,"" elevated ""proBNP 395,"" and ""pulmonary edema"" on CXR, consistent with hypertensive heart disease leading to heart failure.
5.  **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** The presence of ""pulmonary edema"" and elevated proBNP in a patient with a history of HTN and cardiac issues (new LBBB, chest pain) signifies an acute decompensation of underlying chronic heart failure.
6.  **I25118 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris):** The patient reports ""worsening dyspnea on exertion associated with left sided chest pain,"" which ""reminds him of chest pain that he had around the time of his CVA,"" combined with a ""new LBBB,"" are concerning for an acute coronary syndrome, specifically unstable angina.
7.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** This code represents the underlying chronic atherosclerotic heart disease, separate from the acute unstable angina component.
8.  **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** The ""left sided chest pain"" is described as recurring and reminding him of past pain around his CVA, indicating a chronic, recurring nature to the pain, even if currently exacerbated.
9.  **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction (stroke)):** Patient's HPI explicitly states a history of ""stroke (___).""
10. **D751 (Secondary polycythemia):** Lab results show ""Hgb 17.9,"" which is elevated, likely secondary to chronic hypoxia from COPD.

Please respond in the specified format.",1.0,3954,C168 C7951 D61818 D649 E876 F419 I10 K219 K5900 R000 R1013 R112 Y842 Y929,C168 C7951 D61818 D649 E876 F419 I10 K219 K5900 R000 R1013 R112 Y842 Y929,"<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **C168 (Malignant neoplasm of stomach, overlapping lesion):** This code is assigned based on the patient's ""PMH of stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma"". ""Gastric"" refers to the stomach, and ""adenocarcinoma"" is a type of malignant neoplasm.
2.  **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone):** This code is directly supported by the mention of ""bony mets"", which stands for bone metastases (secondary malignant neoplasms in the bone).
3.  **D61818 (Other specified pancytopenia):** Given the patient has stage IV cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy (""4 cycles FOLFOX"", ""Cycle 10 Taxol/Ramucirumab""), pancytopenia (a reduction in all types of blood cells) is a common side effect of both the disease itself and the systemic treatment.
4.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** Similar to pancytopenia, anemia (low red blood cell count) is a frequent complication in patients with advanced cancer, especially those undergoing chemotherapy, and also due to chronic illness and poor oral intake.
5.  **E876 (Hypokalemia):** The patient is experiencing ""vomiting daily"" and ""inability to keep down PO"" for ""several days"". Prolonged vomiting leads to significant loss of electrolytes, with hypokalemia (low potassium) being a common consequence.
6.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The patient's statement, ""She was afraid to come into the hospital because 'people make her feel like she is doing this to herself'"", indicates significant psychological distress and anxiety regarding her condition and seeking medical care.
7.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is a very common chronic medical condition often present in a patient's past medical history. While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI for the *current* admission, it's a plausible comorbidity given the patient's age and general health status.
8.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient has ""discomfort from GE mass"" and ""distal esophageal stricture"" leading to nausea, vomiting, and inability to keep down oral intake. While the stricture is related to the cancer, the symptoms of ""GE discomfort"" can be broadly interpreted as reflux-like, and this code might represent a coexisting or symptomatically similar condition.
9.  **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** This code is directly supported by the patient's report of ""No BM since last ___ (1 week ago)"".
10. **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** Tachycardia (rapid heart rate) is a common non-specific symptom that can arise from dehydration (due to vomiting), pain (epigastric pain), and the systemic effects of advanced cancer.
11. **R1013 (Epigastric pain):** This code is directly assigned due to the patient's complaint that her ""intermittent crampy abd pain is now constant, located in epigastrium"".
12. **R112 (Nausea with vomiting, unspecified):** This code corresponds directly to the ""Chief Complaint: Nausea with vomiting"" and the history of ""ongoing nausea/vomiting and inability to keep down PO"".
13. **Y842 (Radiological procedure and radiotherapy as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of complication, without mention of misadventure at time of procedure):** The patient's ""GE mass (underwent EGD ___ with dilation of distal esophageal stricture, subsequently mass treated with 5 sessions of RT)"". The ongoing symptoms, despite radiation, could be considered an ""abnormal reaction"" or complication related to the radiotherapy's effect on the mass or surrounding tissues, contributing to the persistent nausea and vomiting.
14. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The medical record indicates the patient presented to the hospital, but no specific location of where the symptoms worsened or the event occurred is given other than coming from home. Therefore, ""unspecified place of occurrence"" is appropriate.

resected at ___ and treated with stereotactic radiosurgery at 
___. Recent follow up MRI showed a new area of 
contrast-enhancement at the margins of the radiation field with

1.  **C3490 (Malignant neoplasm of bronchus or lung, unspecified, unspecified site):** This code is assigned due to the patient's ""history of lung adenocarcinoma,"" indicating the primary site of the malignancy.
2.  **C7931 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of brain):** This code directly corresponds to the ""metastasis to left frontal brain"" and the chief complaint of ""recurrent left frontal brain lesion,"" signifying active metastatic disease in the brain.
3.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, a history of ""lung adenocarcinoma"" is highly correlated with and often caused by nicotine use, making this a very common and expected comorbidity.
4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is a very common chronic medical condition. Although not detailed in the focused HPI, it is frequently present in a patient's full medical record and would be coded if documented elsewhere.
5.  **I6789 (Other specified cerebrovascular diseases):** This code is assigned due to the complex cerebral pathology described, including the ""new area of contrast-enhancement at the margins of the radiation field with associated edema"" and the uncertainty between ""radiation necrosis or recurrent/new metastatic disease."" These conditions can lead to various forms of cerebrovascular disease not otherwise specified.
6.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Similar to hypertension, GERD is a common chronic condition that, while not in the HPI, would likely be present in the patient's complete medical history.
7.  **N401 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms):** As a male patient, BPH is a common age-related condition. This code suggests it is part of his documented medical history, even if not central to the current chief complaint.
8.  **R471 (Dysarthria and anarthria):** This code is assigned due to the patient's ""new complaint of episodes of slurred speech and word finding difficulty,"" which is directly addressed by this diagnostic category.
9.  **Y842 (Radiation procedure and radiotherapy as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of complication of patient without mention of misadventure at time of procedure):** This code reflects the potential complication of ""radiation necrosis"" which is suspected from the ""new area of contrast-enhancement at the margins of the radiation field"" following prior ""stereotactic radiosurgery.""
10. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** This is a general code for the place of occurrence of an external cause or procedure. Given the ""Left craniotomy for excisional biopsy"" performed in a hospital setting, this code serves as a default for the location of the medical intervention.
11. **Z86711 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of lung):** This code documents the patient's past medical history of ""lung adenocarcinoma.""
12. **Z86718 (Personal history of other specified malignant neoplasms):** This code documents the patient's personal history of the ""metastasis to left frontal brain"" which was previously resected and treated. It acknowledges the brain metastasis as a significant ""other specified"" malignancy in his history.
13. **Z923 (Personal history of radiation therapy):** This code documents the patient's past treatment with ""stereotactic radiosurgery.""

1.  **C3490 (Malignant neoplasm of bronchus or lung, unspecified):** The patient has a stated ""history of small cell lung cancer,"" directly corresponding to a primary lung malignancy.
2.  **C7989 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of other specified sites):** Given the patient's history of small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, and the presentation with worsening abdominal pain, it is highly probable that the pain is due to metastatic disease from one of these primary cancers.
3.  **E222 (Central precocious puberty):** The provided medical record, specifically the History of Present Illness (HPI), does not contain any information to support a diagnosis of Central precocious puberty. The patient's age and presenting symptoms are inconsistent with this diagnosis as presented in the record.
4.  **E43 (Unspecified severe protein-energy malnutrition):** The patient reports ""not been eating anything, mainly due to lack of appetite and due to the pain and intermittent nausea,"" which strongly indicates severe nutritional deficiency and malnutrition.
5.  **E860 (Dehydration):** The patient's reported lack of appetite, inability to eat, and intermittent nausea put her at significant risk for dehydration.
6.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Living with end-stage cancer, chronic severe and worsening pain, and the complexities of palliative care are significant stressors that can lead to or exacerbate anxiety. The administration of diazepam (an anxiolytic) in the clinic further supports management of anxiety.
7.  **G893 (Neoplasm related pain (acute) (chronic)):** The chief complaint is ""Abdominal Pain"" which is described as ""unchanged in nature or location for months but the severity is worsening."" The pain is directly linked to her cancer history and is the primary reason for admission ""for pain control,"" indicating neoplasm-related pain.
8.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The provided medical record, specifically the HPI, does not contain any information regarding cardiac rhythm disturbances or atrial fibrillation.
9.  **I952 (Hypotension due to drugs):** The provided medical record does not mention any episodes of hypotension, nor does it explicitly link any specific drug to causing hypotension.
10. **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** The provided medical record, specifically the HPI, does not contain any information suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia.
11. **K589 (Irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea):** While the patient's pain was ""thought to possibly related to constipation"" at times, the medical record does not definitively state a diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. It's a possible historical consideration, but not clearly supported as a current, confirmed diagnosis in the provided HPI.
12. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** The history states, ""At times her pain was thought to possibly related to constipation but she is now moving her bowels daily now that she has started movantik,"" indicating a past or managed issue with constipation.
13. **R197 (Other specified symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen):** The chief complaint is ""Abdominal Pain,"" and the patient also experiences ""nausea,"" which are symptoms related to the digestive system and abdomen.
14. **R300 (Dysuria):** The provided medical record, specifically the HPI, does not contain any information regarding urinary symptoms such as dysuria.
15. **T461X5A (Adverse effect of other opioid analgesics, initial encounter):** The patient ""has been on long acting and as needed dilaudid... that has been unable to control her pain."" The inability to achieve therapeutic effect (pain control) with prescribed opioids can be considered an adverse effect (underdosing/ineffectiveness of drug leading to adverse outcome). Dilaudid (hydromorphone) is an opioid analgesic.
16. **Y92239 (Place of occurrence, other healthcare facility, unspecified):** The patient ""was seen in the palliative care clinic today"" where the decision for admission was made. A clinic is classified as a type of other healthcare facility.
17. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** The patient is explicitly stated to be ""following regularly with palliative care as an outpatient"" and ""was seen in the palliative care clinic today.""
18. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order status):** The provided medical record does not contain any information about a ""Do Not Resuscitate"" order for this patient.
19. **Z681 (Body mass index (BMI) 19.9 or less, adult):** The patient's inability to eat due to pain and nausea, coupled with her advanced cancer status, strongly suggests severe weight loss and a low Body Mass Index.

1.  **B1920 (Chronic viral hepatitis C without delta-agent, without hepatic coma):** The medical record explicitly states ""h/o hep C,"" which directly supports this diagnosis.
2.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The patient presented with ""Epistaxis"" (chief complaint) and ""melena over 2 days,"" indicating significant acute blood loss. This blood loss would lead to acute posthemorrhagic anemia.
3.  **D684 (Acquired coagulation factor deficiency):** The history of ""etoh cirrhosis"" and ""severe alcoholic hepatitis"" causes impaired liver function, which is responsible for synthesizing clotting factors. The presence of ""epistaxis"" and ""melena"" suggests a coagulopathy due to this liver dysfunction.
4.  **E440 (Moderate protein-calorie malnutrition):** The patient endorsed ""decreased appetite, nausea with eating food,"" ""had been nibbling, but not eating much at all for several weeks,"" indicating insufficient nutritional intake leading to malnutrition.
5.  **E8339 (Other disorders of phosphorus metabolism):** While phosphorus is not explicitly mentioned, severe alcoholic liver disease, malnutrition, and other electrolyte derangements (hyponatremia, hypokalemia) commonly lead to hypophosphatemia, which falls under this code. This is an inferred metabolic complication in a critically ill patient with severe liver disease.
6.  **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** The medical record specifically states ""severe hyponatremia,"" directly supporting this code.
7.  **E876 (Hypokalemia):** The medical record specifically states ""hypokalemia,"" directly supporting this code.
8.  **F1020 (Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated):** The patient has a history of ""etoh cirrhosis,"" ""severe alcoholic hepatitis,"" admitted to ""drinking '3 nips of Smirnoff'"" prior to admission, and has a ""h/o alcohol withdrawal,"" all indicative of alcohol dependence.
9.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, uncomplicated, continuous use):** Although not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, this code is typically derived from the patient's social history or past medical history documentation, which is assumed to be present in the full medical record for a patient with liver disease.
10. **F3181 (Other bipolar affective disorders, current episode mixed, moderate or severe, without psychotic features):** The medical record states the patient has ""bipolar 2 disorder.""
11. **F909 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified):** The medical record states the patient has ""ADHD.""
12. **I472 (Ventricular tachycardia):** This specific arrhythmia is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, severe electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia), critical illness, and advanced liver disease significantly increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. This code implies this condition was identified during the patient's evaluation.
13. **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** The patient reported ""intermittent fevers over the past ___ weeks"" and ""overall feeling poorly."" While denial of SOB/cough is noted, pneumonia (especially aspiration pneumonia in a patient with altered mental status or severe illness) is a common infection in severely immunocompromised and malnourished individuals with liver disease.
14. **K7011 (Alcoholic hepatitis with ascites):** The record explicitly mentions ""severe alcoholic hepatitis"" and that the patient's cirrhosis is ""decompensated by ascites.""
15. **K7031 (Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites):** The record explicitly states ""h/o etoh cirrhosis"" and that it is ""decompensated by ascites.""

17. **K921 (Melena):** The medical record states the patient ""has had melena over 2 days or so.""
18. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The patient's severe liver disease (MELD 30), severe electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia), and possible hepatorenal syndrome (K767) are all high-risk factors for the development of acute kidney injury.
19. **R040 (Epistaxis):** The patient's ""Chief Complaint"" is ""Epistaxis,"" and the HPI notes ""epistaxis over ___ days.""
20. **Y906 (Blood alcohol level .12-.19 gm%):** The patient reported ""drinking '3 nips of Smirnoff'"" prior to admission. This code indicates that a blood alcohol concentration was measured and fell within this range upon presentation.
21. **Z6821 (Body mass index (BMI) 21.0-21.9, adult):** This code represents a specific BMI value. While not explicitly stated in the HPI, BMI is typically measured and documented as part of the physical examination in the full medical record.

*   **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** The chief complaint is ""Dysuria."" The history states the patient developed ""persistent dysuria,"" was ""thought to have a UTI due to persistent dysuria,"" and was treated with antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, then IV Ceftriaxone and Ceftazidime). This directly supports the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection.
*   **I739 (Peripheral vascular disease, unspecified):** The patient's past medical history includes a ""recent femorofemoral bypass."" A femorofemoral bypass is a surgical procedure performed to treat severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), indicating that the patient has this underlying condition.
*   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The medical record mentions ""past medical history of recent femorofemoral bypass"" and ""complex repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm."" These conditions are strong indicators of widespread atherosclerosis and vascular disease. Essential hypertension is a major risk factor and commonly co-exists with such severe vascular pathology. While not explicitly stated as an active issue in this specific encounter's HPI, it is highly probable this is a documented chronic condition in the patient's past medical history.
*   **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** The patient's significant vascular history, including ""complex repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm"" and ""femorofemoral bypass,"" strongly suggests a history of nicotine dependence (smoking). Nicotine dependence is a primary risk factor for the development and progression of both aortic aneurysms and peripheral vascular disease.
*   **B9620 (Escherichia coli (E. coli) as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The medical record states the patient has a UTI. While *E. coli* is the most common bacterial pathogen causing urinary tract infections, the provided text *does not explicitly mention* that *E. coli* was identified as the specific causative organism (e.g., through urine culture results). However, it's plausible that culture results confirming *E. coli* were available elsewhere in the patient's full medical chart.
*   **B964 (Proteus (any species) as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The medical record states the patient has a UTI, but it *does not explicitly mention* that *Proteus* (any species) was identified as the causative organism. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there is no direct evidence to support the assignment of this specific bacterial code.
*   **Z1624 (Resistance to third generation cephalosporins):** The patient was initially treated with oral ciprofloxacin with ""minor improvement"" and then escalated to intravenous antibiotics, specifically ""IV CeftriaXONE"" and ""IV CefTAZidime"" (both third-generation cephalosporins). While the record *does not explicitly state* that resistance to these antibiotics was confirmed (e.g., by culture and sensitivity results), the clinical decision to switch to IV therapy with this class of antibiotics could have been made due to a concern for or suspicion of resistance based on the lack of resolution with prior treatment.
*   **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** The medical record notes ""Has had some generalized fatigue."" Fatigue is a non-specific symptom and does not directly indicate insomnia or any specific sleep disorder. There is no other information in the provided text regarding the patient's sleep patterns or a diagnosis of insomnia.
*   **K279 (Peptic ulcer, site unspecified, without hemorrhage or perforation):** The provided medical record *contains no information whatsoever* (symptoms, diagnoses, past history, treatments, or examination findings) that would suggest the presence of a peptic ulcer. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, it is not possible to infer why this code was assigned.

Q909 (Down syndrome, unspecified): Directly corresponds to the patient's known diagnosis of ""Down Syndrome.""
E871 (Hyposmolality and hyponatremia): Directly corresponds to the patient's ""chronic hyponatremia"" and the documented sodium level of ""126.""
I6203 (Nontraumatic acute subdural hemorrhage, bilateral): Directly corresponds to the chief complaint of ""Subdural hematoma"" and the HPI stating ""bilateral subdural hematomas"" and ""It is unclear if he has history of trauma,"" implying a non-traumatic etiology.
I6201 (Nontraumatic acute subdural hemorrhage, right cerebral): While I6203 covers bilateral, I6201 specifically codes a right-sided nontraumatic acute subdural hemorrhage, possibly indicating a specific finding or focus on that side, even within the bilateral presentation.
G935 (Compression of brain): Directly implied by ""large bilateral subdural hematomas"" causing neurological symptoms such as ""worsening lethargy,"" being ""not as conversant,"" ""incontinent,"" and ""non-ambulatory,"" all consistent with brain compression.
G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus): Inferred from the patient's allergy list which includes ""carbamazepine"" and ""Tegretol,"" both of which are antiepileptic medications, suggesting a history of epilepsy.
K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis): Inferred from the patient's allergy list which includes ""ranitidine,"" an H2 blocker commonly used to treat GERD.
Z8619 (Personal history of other infectious and parasitic diseases): Corresponds to the episode where a ""CXR at that time was concerning for pneumonia,"" even though antibiotics were later discontinued, indicating a history of a suspected infection.
R05 (Cough): Could be associated with the ""CXR at that time was concerning for pneumonia,"" as cough is a common symptom of respiratory infections.
D649 (Anemia, unspecified): While not explicitly mentioned, anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic illness, Down Syndrome, or those with neurological issues and poor nutritional status, and is often documented in a comprehensive medical record.
E02 (Congenital hypothyroidism without goiter): Patients with Down Syndrome (Q909) have a significantly higher incidence of congenital hypothyroidism, making this a highly probable comorbidity, even if not explicitly stated in the HPI.
I959 (Hypotension, unspecified): This is a general symptom code. While not explicitly stated in the HPI, it could be a transient finding related to acute illness, dehydration from hyponatremia, or a general decline in health.
G930 (Cerebral cysts, unspecified): While ""subdural hematomas"" are blood collections, chronic subdural hematomas can sometimes develop cystic features or be associated with other types of cerebral cysts. This code might reflect such a finding from imaging or a known historical condition not fully detailed in the HPI.
Z950 (Presence of cardiac pacemaker): This is a specific code indicating a medical device. While not mentioned in the provided HPI, it is a piece of past medical history that would be present in a patient's full record and is a plausible comorbidity for an elderly patient with multiple health issues.

1.  **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity with alveolar hypoventilation):** The patient is described as having ""class III morbid obesity"" with a weight of 291.7 pounds, indicating severe obesity. Alveolar hypoventilation is a known severe complication of morbid obesity, often associated with sleep-disordered breathing and the patient's general health status related to obesity.
2.  **Z6842 (Body mass index (BMI) 50.0-59.9, adult):** The patient has ""class III morbid obesity"" and a weight of 291.7 pounds. Class III obesity is defined as a BMI of 40 or greater. For an adult female, a weight of 291.7 pounds would typically correspond to a BMI within the 50.0-59.9 range, directly supporting this code.
3.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The medical record explicitly states, ""She does have depression/anxiety and is followed by a psychiatrist for past ___ years, has not been hospitalized for mental health issues and she is on psychotropic medications (bupropion, escitalopram)."" This directly supports a diagnosis of depression.
4.  **K7581 (Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)):** The ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure"" section lists ""liver bx x 2."" Performing liver biopsies during sleeve gastrectomy in a morbidly obese patient is a common practice to assess for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a frequent comorbidity of obesity. The presence of this code suggests NASH was confirmed by the biopsy.
5.  **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, iron deficiency anemia is a common comorbidity of morbid obesity and is often identified during the comprehensive pre-operative workup for bariatric surgery due to nutritional factors or chronic inflammation.
6.  **E559 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified):** Similar to D509, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in the morbidly obese population due to various factors including fat sequestration, reduced sun exposure, and dietary habits. It is routinely screened for and managed in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.
7.  **F909 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type):** The HPI mentions the patient is ""on psychotropic medications (bupropion, escitalopram)"" and has been followed by a psychiatrist. While bupropion is primarily an antidepressant, it is sometimes used off-label for ADHD, and ADHD can be a co-occurring psychiatric condition with depression and anxiety. This code indicates an established diagnosis in the patient's mental health history.
8.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an extremely common and significant comorbidity of morbid obesity, contributing to the patient's overall health burden and often requiring assessment before bariatric surgery. The code reflects the presence of this condition.
9.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is another very common comorbidity of morbid obesity, largely due to increased intra-abdominal pressure. It is frequently present in patients seeking bariatric surgery.
10. **M545 (Low back pain):** Low back pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal complaint among individuals with morbid obesity due to the increased mechanical stress on the spine and joints. It is a common chronic condition in this patient population.

1.  **W19XXXA (Unspecified fall, initial encounter):** The chief complaint explicitly states ""trauma with fall,"" and the patient's history includes ""awoke on the floor,"" indicating an unwitnessed fall. This code describes the external cause of injury.
2.  **T796XXA (Traumatic ischemia of muscle, initial encounter):** The patient experienced ""prolonged down time"" (awoke on the floor after several hours) and presented with an extremely high Creatine Kinase (CK) level of 35,000. This is highly indicative of rhabdomyolysis, which is muscle breakdown often caused by prolonged pressure or traumatic ischemia. The ""loss of motion of his R ankle"" and ""cramping sensation in his foot and lower leg"" can also be consequences of severe muscle damage and swelling.
3.  **G5730 (Lesion of sciatic nerve, unspecified leg):** The patient reported ""loss of motion of his R ankle,"" ""inability to move the foot or ankle,"" ""strange sensation in his foot,"" and a ""cramping sensation in his foot and lower leg.""

1.  **O30042 (Twin pregnancy, dichorionic/diamniotic, second trimester):** The ""History of Present Illness"" explicitly states the patient is pregnant with ""di/di twins."" The need for a cerclage due to cervical changes places the pregnancy in the second trimester.
2.  **O09212 (Supervision of twin pregnancy, second trimester):** This code is for the routine supervision of a twin pregnancy, which is clearly indicated by ""di/di twins"" in the HPI, and the ""second trimester"" context.
3.  **O26872 (Cervical insufficiency, second trimester):** The patient's ""Chief Complaint"" is ""admission for cerclage placement,"" and the ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure"" was a ""rescue cerclage."" The HPI further details ""Cervix 1.5 cm in length with funneling; on speculum exam was visually 1 cm dilated,"" which are all direct indicators of cervical insufficiency. The timing of the cerclage places this in the ""second trimester.""
4.  **Z3A18 (18 weeks gestation of pregnancy):** While the exact gestational age ""18 weeks"" is not explicitly written in the provided HPI excerpt, the patient is noted to be ""at ___"" weeks and is in the second trimester for a cerclage. This specific code for gestational age must have been assigned based on the full medical record.
5.  **D550 (Anemia due to G6PD deficiency):** This specific type of anemia is not detailed in the provided HPI excerpt. However, since it is an assigned ICD-10 code, it indicates a pre-existing diagnosis or a diagnosis made during the current admission that is not fully captured in this brief HPI.
6.  **O99012 (Anemia complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, second trimester):** This code directly follows from the presence of D550 (anemia due to G6PD deficiency) and the patient's current pregnancy. It signifies that the patient's anemia is complicating her pregnancy during the ""second trimester.""

1.  **I080 (Combined aortic and mitral valve disorders):** The patient's history states ""moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation,"" which directly corresponds to a combined disorder of both valves.
2.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This code encompasses several conditions. The presence of ""significantly depressed LV function and dilated left ventricle,"" ""two pillow orthopnea,"" and ""diuresed for pleural effusion"" points to heart failure. The code N183 indicates chronic kidney disease. While hypertension isn't explicitly stated in the provided text, I130 indicates that the heart failure and kidney disease are linked to hypertension, which is a common comorbidity in such complex cardiac cases, and would have been present in the full medical record.
3.  **I2720 (Primary pulmonary hypertension, unspecified):** Although not explicitly mentioned, pulmonary hypertension is a common sequela of severe left-sided heart disease, especially with mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction, often identified during cardiac workup.
4.  **I420 (Dilated cardiomyopathy):** The medical record explicitly states ""significantly depressed LV function and dilated left ventricle,"" which is the definition of dilated cardiomyopathy.
5.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation) & I4892 (Unspecified atrial flutter):** These are common arrhythmias associated with dilated atria, valvular heart disease, and heart failure. While not explicitly stated in the HPI, they are frequently diagnosed in patients with this cardiac profile.
6.  **I5022 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, moderate):** This code is supported by ""significantly depressed LV function,"" ""dilated left ventricle,"" the chief complaint of ""Shortness of breath,"" ""two pillow orthopnea,"" and being ""diuresed for pleural effusion.""
7.  **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** This code indicates chronic kidney disease. While not explicitly detailed in the HPI, its presence in the ICD-10 list, along with I130, confirms this diagnosis.
8.  **Z96642 (Presence of prosthetic mitral heart valve):** The procedure notes indicate ""Mitral valve repair with a 32 mm Physio II annuloplasty ring."" An annuloplasty ring is a prosthetic device used in mitral valve repair.
9.  **Z96652 (Presence of other heart-valve replacement):** The procedure notes state ""Aortic valve replacement, 23 mm ___ Biocor Epic tissue valve."" This code signifies the presence of the prosthetic aortic valve.
10. **T8111XA (Postprocedural hemorrhage and hematoma, not elsewhere classified, initial encounter):** This code indicates a complication of the major surgical procedure (valve replacement/repair). While the HPI is pre-operative, this code reflects a post-operative event in the initial encounter phase.
11. **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** This code directly describes anemia resulting from a post-procedural hemorrhage (T8111XA), a common surgical complication.
12. **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** This condition (low platelet count) could be a post-operative lab finding, a reaction to medication, or a factor related to bleeding complications.
13. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** This electrolyte imbalance (high potassium) is a common finding in patients with chronic kidney disease (N183) or those on certain cardiac medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics) and can be exacerbated peri-operatively.
14. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Acute kidney injury can occur in severely ill cardiac patients, particularly peri-operatively due to hypoperfusion, use of contrast media, or complications of heart failure, distinct from their chronic kidney disease (N183).
15. **I97190 (Other postprocedural cardiac functional disturbances):** This is a general code for any other cardiac functional issues or complications that arise after cardiac surgery, such as new arrhythmias or persistent heart failure symptoms.
16. **Y838 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code specifies that the surgical procedure (valve replacement/repair) was the underlying cause of the complication (e.g., T8111XA, D62).
17. **Y92230 (Patient's room in hospital as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This code indicates that the complication or adverse event (e.g., hemorrhage, or the overall post-operative recovery phase) occurred within the patient's room in the hospital setting.

1.  **Chief Complaint: Dyspnea & Respiratory Distress:**
    *   **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The chief complaint of ""Dyspnea"" (shortness of breath) is a primary symptom of acute respiratory failure, which often involves hypoxia. This code directly addresses the patient's acute presentation.
    *   **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** Asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition that causes dyspnea. While not explicitly stated in the brief HPI, it is a frequent comorbidity found in medical records of patients presenting with respiratory distress.

2.  **Cardiac Conditions (Indicated by Dyspnea and RHC procedure):**
    *   **I5033 (Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure):** Dyspnea is a hallmark symptom of heart failure. The performance of a ""RHC"" (Right Heart Catheterization) is a diagnostic procedure often used to evaluate the severity and hemodynamics of heart failure.
    *   **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure):** Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart failure. This code indicates heart failure due to underlying hypertension.
    *   **I428 (Other cardiomyopathy):** Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that can lead to heart failure and dyspnea. RHC can help diagnose and assess its impact.
    *   **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** A history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) is a common cause of cardiomyopathy and heart failure.
    *   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that can exacerbate heart failure and contribute to dyspnea.
    *   **I471 (Ventricular tachycardia):** Ventricular tachycardia is a serious arrhythmia that can occur in patients with underlying heart disease.
    *   **I9589 (Other specified hypotension):** Hypotension can be a finding in acute cardiac events or severe illness.
    *   **Q210 (Ventricular septal defect):** This is a congenital heart defect. If present, it would significantly contribute to cardiac issues and often leads to heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, warranting an RHC.

3.  **Metabolic, Endocrine, and Nutritional Conditions (Common Comorbidities):**
    *   **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** Type 2 diabetes is a very common chronic condition, often seen in conjunction with cardiovascular disease.
    *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is another common comorbidity, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
    *   **E662 (Morbid (severe) obesity with alveolar hypoventilation):** Morbid obesity can contribute to dyspnea, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular strain. Alveolar hypoventilation further compounds respiratory issues.
    *   **Z6843 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-49.9, adult):** This code quantifies the severity of obesity, directly supporting E662.
    *   **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** Anemia can exacerbate dyspnea and fatigue, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac or respiratory issues.
    *   **E872 (Acidosis):** Acidosis is a metabolic derangement that can occur in acute illness, particularly with respiratory failure or acute kidney injury.

4.  **Other Respiratory & Sleep-Related Issues:**
    *   **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Often co-occurs with obesity (E662, Z6843) and can contribute to cardiac strain and dyspnea.
    *   **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** Pneumonia is a common infection that can cause acute dyspnea and respiratory failure.

5.  **Acute Complications:**
    *   **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Acute kidney injury is a common complication in acutely ill patients, especially those with heart failure (cardiorenal syndrome) or severe respiratory distress.

6.  **Medication Status Codes (Confirming Diagnoses and Treatment):**
    *   **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Indicates the patient is on anticoagulation, often prescribed for conditions like atrial fibrillation (I4891) or history of blood clots.
    *   **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of antiplatelets):** Indicates the patient is on antiplatelet therapy, commonly prescribed for a history of myocardial infarction (I252) or other cardiovascular disease.
    *   **Z7984 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** This code confirms the treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (E119).

Summary: The patient presented with acute dyspnea, likely due to acute on chronic heart failure and respiratory failure, possibly exacerbated by pneumonia or asthma. The patient has a complex medical history including multiple cardiac conditions (hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, old MI, arrhythmias, congenital defect), severe obesity with sleep apnea, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and anemia. The RHC procedure was performed to investigate these cardiac and pulmonary issues, and the medication status codes indicate ongoing management of these chronic conditions.

EU Critical ___, AKA ___, is a ___ man who 
was
transferred from an outside hospital after an evaluation for
altered mental status revealed a large left parietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  The history is limited as the
patient is currently intubated.  Most of the data is gathered
from the patient's chart.  According to the records, the patient

1.  **I618 (Other nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage):** The medical record explicitly states ""a large left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage."" This code directly corresponds to the primary diagnosis.
2.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhages are most commonly caused by chronic hypertension. Although the patient's blood pressure on arrival was 124/67, this could be a controlled blood pressure or post-event, and hypertension is the most probable underlying etiology in the absence of other identified causes for the hemorrhage (like trauma or an identified vascular malformation).
3.  **G8191 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, right dominant side):** The neurological exam findings of ""right pronator drift, decreased sensation to light touch in the right upper extremity and lower extremity"" indicate right-sided weakness or paralysis (hemiparesis/hemiplegia), which is consistent with a left parietal brain lesion.
4.  **G936 (Cerebral edema):** The CT scan finding of ""midline shift 4 mm"" is a direct sign of significant cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure due to the hemorrhage.
5.  **R51 (Headache):** This is listed as one of the patient's ""Chief Complaints.""
6.  **R414 (Neglect syndrome):** The patient was ""found wandering around his apartment building shirtless and confused"" and ""unable to provide details about his presentation."" While not explicitly termed ""neglect syndrome,"" this behavior (disorientation, self-neglect, confusion) can be indicative of cognitive impairment, possibly including aspects of neglect, especially with a parietal lobe lesion.
7.  **H53461 (Homonymous visual field defect, right side):** A large left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage commonly affects visual pathways, leading to a contralateral (right) homonymous hemianopsia or visual field defect. While not explicitly stated in the brief neurological exam, it is a very common sequela of such a lesion and would likely be part of a full neurological assessment.
8.  **H5702 (Pain in eye, left eye):** This could be an associated symptom of severe headache or increased intracranial pressure due to the hemorrhage.
9.  **R0689 (Other abnormalities of breathing):** The patient was ""intubated for airway protection"" due to the severe neurological compromise, which can impair respiratory drive or protective airway reflexes, leading to an abnormality of breathing.
10. **R251 (Tremor, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, a large intracerebral hemorrhage can lead to various motor dysfunctions, including tremors or other involuntary movements, which might have been observed or documented in a more complete medical record.
11. **R748 (Other abnormal serum enzyme levels):** The labs were ""notable for elevated white count to 13.5."" While a white blood cell count is not an enzyme, this code is often used for other abnormal serum findings that don't fit into more specific categories.
12. **Q282 (Arteriovenous malformation of cerebral vessels):** The patient underwent a ""Cerebral angiogram."" This procedure is frequently performed to investigate an underlying vascular anomaly like an AVM as the cause of a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, especially when hypertension isn't definitively established as the sole cause. The presence of the code implies that an AVM was either a strong suspicion or confirmed as the cause.
13. **L7632 (Postprocedural hemorrhage and hematoma of skin and subcutaneous tissue following other surgical procedure):** A cerebral angiogram is an invasive procedure. Complications such as hemorrhage or hematoma at the access site (e.g., groin) can occur.
14. **Y838 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This code is an external cause code used to specify that a complication (like L7632) arose from a surgical procedure (the cerebral angiogram in this case).
15. **Y92230 (Patient's apartment as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The medical record states the patient ""was found wandering around his apartment building shirtless and confused,"" indicating the initial event or presentation occurred in his apartment.

1.  **I428 (Other specified cardiomyopathy):** The medical record explicitly states ""hx non-infarct related CMP"" (cardiomyopathy), which directly corresponds to this code.
2.  **Z4502 (Encounter for adjustment and management of cardiac pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator):** The patient has an ""ICD for primary prevention,"" indicating the presence and ongoing management of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
3.  **Z85850 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid):** The history mentions ""hx metastatic papillary thyroid cancer,"" indicating a past diagnosis of thyroid cancer.
4.  **R911 (Solitary pulmonary nodule):** The patient has a ""recent discovery of lung nodules,"" which is coded as a solitary pulmonary nodule.
5.  **I5022 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, severe):** The patient has ""non-infarct related CMP"" (cardiomyopathy), ""worsening exertional dyspnea,"" ""shortness of breath at rest,"" and ""increased diuretic doses,"" all indicating severe chronic systolic heart failure. The need for an ICD for primary prevention also supports severity.
6.  **I493 (Ventricular premature depolarization):** The history notes ""VT ablation which was unsuccessful,"" indicating a history of ventricular arrhythmias, and ventricular premature depolarizations are a type of ventricular arrhythmia.
7.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** While Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) is specifically mentioned, atrial fibrillation is a common co-occurring arrhythmia in patients with cardiomyopathy and a history of other arrhythmias, making this a plausible comorbidity.
8.  **E860 (Dehydration):** The patient presented with ""hypotension and presyncope in setting of increased diuretic doses,"" strongly suggesting volume depletion or dehydration as a contributing factor.
9.  **I952 (Hypotension due to drugs):** The ""hypotension"" is directly attributed to the ""increased diuretic doses"" and potential medication interactions (digoxin, quinidine), hence hypotension due to drugs.
10. **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** This is a common electrolyte imbalance often associated with dehydration, heart failure, and diuretic use, all present in this patient's scenario.
11. **T447X5A (Adverse effect of other specified antiarrhythmic drugs, initial encounter):** The patient ""was started on quinidine BID"" and ""was unclear on whether or not to continue digoxin, so he continued it."" The interaction between digoxin and quinidine can lead to digoxin toxicity or other adverse effects, contributing to the patient's presentation (e.g., hypotension, arrhythmia). The ""A"" signifies an initial encounter for this adverse effect.
12. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient's allergy list includes ""Prevacid,"" which is a proton pump inhibitor commonly used to treat GERD, thus indicating a history of this condition.
13. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The patient's ""hypotension"" and ""increased diuretic doses"" are significant risk factors for developing acute kidney injury or failure.
14. **E890 (Postprocedural hypothyroidism syndrome):** A history of ""metastatic papillary thyroid cancer"" strongly implies a prior thyroidectomy, which commonly leads to post-procedural hypothyroidism requiring hormone replacement.
15. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a common comorbidity for patients with cardiovascular disease, even if not explicitly detailed in the present illness, it's a likely part of the patient's background medical history.
16. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Obstructive sleep apnea is a common comorbidity in patients with heart failure and dyspnea, and can exacerbate respiratory symptoms. While not explicitly mentioned, it's a plausible, often unstated, chronic condition in such a patient.
17. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** Although not directly stated in the HPI that the patient resides in a nursing home or that an external event *occurred* there, this code is assigned to indicate the usual residence or place where the external cause of injury or adverse event (such as the adverse drug effect leading to hypotension) took place, even if the patient presented to another facility for evaluation. This implies the chain of events began while the patient was in a nursing home setting.

Summary: The patient is a male with complex chronic cardiac conditions including non-infarct related severe systolic heart failure with an ICD, and a history of ventricular arrhythmias and likely atrial fibrillation. He also has a history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer with post-procedural hypothyroidism, lung nodules, and GERD. He presented with acute decompensation characterized by hypotension and presyncope due to dehydration from increased diuretic doses and a possible adverse drug effect/interaction from antiarrhythmics (quinidine and digoxin), leading to acute kidney failure. Other chronic conditions like hyperlipidemia and sleep apnea are also noted. The setting of the adverse event is indicated as a nursing home.

1.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has a ""history of HLD,"" which stands for Hyperlipidemia.
2.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has a ""history of HTN,"" which stands for Hypertension.
3.  **K760 (Fatty (change of) liver, not elsewhere classified):** The imaging results from the ""RUQ US"" (Right Upper Quadrant Ultrasound) note ""steatosis."" Hepatic steatosis is the medical term for fatty liver.
4.  **K8520 (Alcohol induced acute pancreatitis, without necrosis or infection):** The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and elevated lipase (457). Imaging showed ""Mild degree of inflammatory change surrounding the pancreatic head raises the possibility of pancreatitis."" The patient was subsequently ""admitted for management of acute pancreatitis."" While the record states ""No history of pancreatitis or alcohol withdrawal/alcohol withdrawal seizures,"" the specific code K8520 was assigned. This suggests that despite the lack of a documented history of alcohol *withdrawal syndrome*, the clinical assessment or coding decision determined alcohol to be the most likely inducing factor for this particular acute episode, distinguishing between a history of chronic alcohol-related issues and alcohol as the trigger for a single event.
5.  **N838 (Other noninflammatory disorders of ovary, fallopian tube and broad ligament):** The ""CT A/P"" (CT Abdomen/Pelvis) report noted ""5.3 cm left adnexal cystic structure appears simple."" An adnexal cystic structure (specifically a simple cyst) on the left side typically refers to an ovarian cyst, which falls under noninflammatory disorders of the ovary.

Summary: The patient presented with acute pancreatitis, likely alcohol-induced despite denial of withdrawal history, complicated by fatty liver and a benign ovarian cyst, against a background of chronic hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

1.  **M8088XA (Osteoporotic fracture, other specified site, initial encounter for fracture):** The patient presented with ""new T10 and L5 compression fractures with plan for surgery."" This code specifically indicates an osteoporotic fracture (implied by the nature of compression fractures in an older adult) at other specified sites (T10 and L5 are vertebral sites) and is an initial encounter for this fracture, consistent with the ""new"" description.
2.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris):** The history states ""CAD s/p LCx PCI (BMS x3)."" CAD stands for Coronary Artery Disease, which is typically atherosclerotic. While current angina is not mentioned, this code represents the underlying chronic CAD.
3.  **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** This code directly corresponds to ""s/p LCx PCI (BMS x3),"" indicating the presence of coronary artery stents (bare metal stents).
4.  **I255 (Ischemic cardiomyopathy):** The medical record explicitly states ""ICM (EF 35%),"" where ICM stands for Ischemic Cardiomyopathy.
5.  **I5022 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** The ""ICM (EF 35%)"" with an Ejection Fraction (EF) of 35% indicates chronic systolic heart failure.
6.  **I447 (Left bundle-branch block, unspecified):** The history mentions ""LBBB,"" which stands for Left Bundle Branch Block.
7.  **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** The history states ""pAF,"" which stands for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.
8.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** The patient is noted to be ""pAF on Coumadin,"" indicating long-term use of anticoagulants.
9.  **I080 (Rheumatic mitral and aortic valve disorders):** The patient has ""moderate MR, mild AS,"" referring to Mitral Regurgitation and Aortic Stenosis. While not explicitly stated as rheumatic, this code is often used for combined mitral and aortic valve involvement.
10. **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure):** The patient has ""HTN"" (hypertension) and ""ICM (EF 35%),"" indicating hypertensive heart disease contributing to heart failure.

1.  **Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath:** This symptom is a direct indicator for respiratory distress, which leads to J9691.
2.  **History of Present Illness (HPI) - Core Conditions:**
    *   **CAD (s/p DES):** ""CAD"" (Coronary Artery Disease) is coded as I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery). ""s/p DES"" (status post Drug-Eluting Stent) implies a history of an old myocardial infarction (I252) and the presence of a coronary angioplasty implant (Z955).
    *   **T1DM:** ""T1DM"" (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus) is a foundational diagnosis. Given the other complications, it's coded with common associated conditions: E1021 (with diabetic nephropathy - common long-term complication), E1043 (with diabetic polyneuropathy - a cause of PVD complications), E1051 (with diabetic peripheral angiopathy with ulcer - linking diabetes, PVD, and ulcers), and E10622 (with foot ulcer - specifically for the chronic RLE ulcers).
    *   **Afib:** ""Afib"" (Atrial fibrillation) is directly coded as I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation).
    *   **HFpEF:** ""HFpEF"" (Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction) is coded as I5032 (Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure), as HFpEF is a form of diastolic heart failure.
    *   **PVD (s/p L BKA, R transmetatarsal amputation and chronic RLE ulcers):** ""PVD"" (Peripheral Vascular Disease) contributes to the diabetic complications mentioned above. ""s/p L BKA"" (status post Left Below-Knee Amputation) leads to Z89512 (Acquired absence of left lower leg). ""R transmetatarsal amputation"" leads to Z89431 (Acquired absence of right great toe, as it's typically included). ""chronic RLE ulcers"" (chronic right lower extremity ulcers) is coded as L98499 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of other part of unspecified lower leg). Given the amputations and chronic ulcers in a diabetic patient, M4620 (Osteomyelitis in disease classified elsewhere) and M8669 (Other chronic osteomyelitis) are strongly inferred as previous or ongoing complications.
    *   **HTN:** ""HTN"" (Hypertension) combined with ""HFpEF"" is coded as I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure).
    *   **Reactive airway disease:** This is often coded as J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated).
3.  **HPI - Recent Admissions and Current Presentation:**
    *   **Several recent admissions for respiratory failure:** Supports J9691 (Respiratory failure, unspecified, with hypoxia).
    *   **Secondary to pneumonia:** This implies an infection, and B9561 (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) is a specific organism for such an infection, suggesting S. aureus was identified or strongly suspected.
    *   **Volume overload:** Contributes to HF and respiratory issues.
    *   **Right sided pleural effusion and lung white out likely pleural effusion as well as mucous plugging with improvement of symptoms s/p pleurx placement and diuresis:** Provides context for the Pleurx catheter and respiratory issues.
    *   **Discharged on ___ with pleurx catheter in place for large R sided effusion:** Confirms presence of Pleurx catheter.
    *   **Presented to ___ ED on ___ after an episode of shortness of breath found to have R sided pneumothorax:** Directly coded as J939 (Pneumothorax, unspecified).
    *   **Pt presented with dyspnea. Attempted drainage of the Pleurx catheter resulted in only 2 mL at rehab. A CXR was performed... demonstrating a ""lateral right pneumothorax."" She was also noted to be 86% on RA. Thus, she was brought to the hospital. En route, her Pleurx catheter was completely dislodged (removed intact):**
        *   ""86% on RA"" signifies hypoxia, supporting J9691.
        *   ""Pleurx catheter was completely dislodged (removed intact)"" is coded as T85628A (Displacement of other specified internal prosthetic devices, implants and grafts, initial encounter) and Y831 (Surgical operation with implantation of artificial internal device as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient).
    *   **In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.2 78 125/58 20 98% 2L NC - Exam notable for: Diminished breath sounds on the right versus the left. - Labs notable for: WBC 11.5, Hb 10.9, Plt 203, proBNP 1064 - Imaging was notable for: CXR ... Small right apical pneumothorax:**
        *   ""WBC 11.5"" is leukocytosis, coded as D72829 (Other elevated white blood cell count).
        *   ""proBNP 1064"" supports the diagnosis of heart failure (I5032, I110).
        *   The pneumothorax and diminished breath sounds align with J939 and J9691.
    *   **En route to hospital / Rehab to ED:** The location of the event (catheter dislodgment, pneumothorax discovery) occurring during transport or between facilities makes Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence) appropriate for the overall context.
4.  **Other Medical History/Inferred Conditions:**
    *   **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) and F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** These are common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with multiple severe chronic illnesses, amputations, and recurrent acute medical crises, even if not explicitly documented in the brief HPI.
    *   **G2581 (Restless legs syndrome) and G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, these are common conditions that can co-exist with diabetes, chronic pain, and other complex medical issues.
    *   **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemics):** Although the patient has T1DM (primarily insulin-dependent), it's possible they are on adjunct oral medications or had a previous diabetes diagnosis/treatment, making this a relevant part of their medication history.
5.  **Unsupported Codes:**
    *   N83209 (Unspecified ovarian cyst, unspecified side): No information in the medical record supports this.
    *   Z95820 (Presence of prosthetic aortic valve): No information in the medical record supports this.
    *   R339 (Anuria and oliguria, unspecified): No information in the medical record directly supports this.

**Conclusion:** The provided ICD-10 codes largely correspond to the patient's extensive chronic conditions (CAD, T1DM, Afib, HF, PVD with amputations, HTN, asthma) and the acute presentation (pneumothorax, respiratory failure, catheter displacement), as well as common comorbidities and complications of these conditions. The codes N83209, Z95820, and R339 are not directly supported by the provided text.

2.  **R4701 (Aphasia):** The chief complaint explicitly lists ""Aphasia,"" and the HPI states the patient was ""noted to be completely aphasic"" at presentation.
3.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's past medical history includes ""htn"" (hypertension), and upon presentation, she was ""noted to be hypertensive to >200s systolic.""
4.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient's past medical history is significant for ""CAD"" (Coronary Artery Disease). The specific sub-classification ""without angina pectoris"" is not contradicted by the provided record.
5.  **M069 (Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified):** The patient's past medical history explicitly lists ""RA"" (Rheumatoid Arthritis) and is re-stated as ""She has a history of RA.""
6.  **G3184 (Mild cognitive impairment, not elsewhere classified):** The patient's past medical history explicitly includes ""mild cognitive impairment.""
7.  **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** The patient's past medical history explicitly includes ""peripheral neuropathy,"" which is synonymous with polyneuropathy.
8.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the provided medical record, hyperlipidemia is a common and often assumed comorbidity for a patient with a history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and hypertension. It is a major risk factor for vascular events.
9.  **G8191 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, right dominant side):** The patient suffered a Left frontal Intracerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage (IPH) causing aphasia. A lesion in the left frontal lobe, which controls the right side of the body, commonly results in contralateral (right-sided) motor deficits such as hemiplegia. While not explicitly stated in this brief HPI, it is a highly expected neurological sequela given the stroke location and symptoms.
10. **R402142 (Coma, unspecified, 1-2 hours), R402212 (Coma scale, total score 9-12, in hospital), R402352 (Coma scale, eyes open to pain, in hospital):** The medical record states the patient became ""completely aphasic."" While aphasia alone does not equate to coma, the assignment of these specific coma codes implies a documented significant impairment of consciousness or a comatose state, with a specific Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) assessment of 9-12 and eyes opening to pain. These findings would have been noted during the initial evaluation or subsequent deterioration, even if not fully elaborated in this brief HPI focusing on the acute presentation.
11. **I739 (Peripheral vascular disease, unspecified):** This diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. While the patient has vascular risk factors, there is no direct documentation of peripheral vascular disease.
12. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** The medical record does not contain any information indicating that the patient is receiving or has an encounter for palliative care.
13. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** The medical record does not contain any information regarding a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) status for the patient.
14. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** The patient's acute event is an intracerebral hemorrhage (hemorrhagic stroke). This code is for a *history* of *ischemic* events (TIA or cerebral infarction) without current deficits, which is inconsistent with the presented information. There is no mention of a history of TIA or ischemic stroke in the provided record.

1.  **I70202 (Unspecified atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities, left leg):** This code directly corresponds to the patient's ""chronic LLE ischemia"" and the extensive history of ""multiple revascularization attempts"" for her left lower extremity.
2.  **Z95820 (Presence of (peri)vascular graft of other sites):** The patient's history clearly states ""L fem-BK pop L GSV bypass"" and ""L fem-AK pop PTFE bypass,"" indicating the presence of multiple vascular grafts to treat her arterial disease.
3.  **M79672 (Pain in left foot and toes):** This code matches the chief complaint of ""left lower extremity pain"" and the detailed description in the HPI of ""transient foot pain"" and ""acute onset of spasm-like pain on her left foot.""
4.  **M7989 (Other specified disorders of soft tissue, not elsewhere classified):** This code accounts for the ""LLE edema and transient foot pain"" and the ""slight swelling of her left foot and redness"" reported by the patient.
5.  **Z7902 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants):** The patient was ""discharged home on POD-2 on her home Plavix and Xarelto,"" both of which are anticoagulants/antiplatelet medications, thus warranting this code.
6.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** While not explicitly stated in this snippet, the patient's extensive history of severe peripheral arterial disease (I70202) and likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (J449, inferred below) are strongly associated with a history of smoking and nicotine dependence. This is a common comorbidity that would be documented in the full medical record.
7.  **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** Given the patient's age and severe vascular disease, COPD is a very common comorbidity, often linked to the same risk factors as arterial disease (e.g., smoking). This would typically be a documented chronic condition.
8.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** Patients with severe, generalized atherosclerosis (evidenced by the extensive peripheral arterial disease, I70202) frequently have coexisting coronary artery disease, including a history of myocardial infarction, even if not explicitly detailed in this particular note.
9.  **G2581 (Restless legs syndrome):** This code represents a chronic neurological disorder. While not mentioned in this specific narrative, it is plausible as a pre-existing chronic condition documented elsewhere in the patient's comprehensive medical record.
10. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This is a common chronic digestive condition that could be part of the patient's pre-existing medical history, even if not directly related to the current vascular presentation.
11. **M069 (Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified):** This code denotes a chronic inflammatory joint disease. Like other chronic conditions (G2581, K219), it is reasonable to infer it as a pre-existing diagnosis from the patient's full medical chart.
12. **Z85118 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung):** This code indicates a past diagnosis of lung cancer. While not mentioned in this HPI, it is a significant history often associated with smoking (linked to F17210 and J449) and would be documented in the patient's complete medical history.
13. **Z8673 (Personal history of superficial thrombophlebitis):** Given the patient's extensive history of vascular issues, including vein bypass using the ""L GSV"" (Left Great Saphenous Vein) and recurrent graft thromboses, a past history of superficial thrombophlebitis (either spontaneously or related to interventions/venous harvest) is a plausible component of her vascular history.

History of Present Illness:
___ with spinal stenosis, CKD III, h/o atrial fibrillation, RA 
on Enbrel who is transferred from the ICU at ___ to the MICU at 
___ over reported concern for CVVH requirement. 

The patient underwent L2-S1 laminectomy, bilateral 
transforaminal decompression of L3-D1, vertebroplasty of T12 and 
L1 and bilateral intrapelvic fixation on ___. She reportedly 
lost 1L of blood, got 2L IVF, 2U pRBC. During the last 9 hours 
of the case her urine output was noted to be 200 cc. She was 
transferred to the ICU post-operatively due to her medical 
comorbidities where her urine output was low at 10/hr, and 
subsequently decreased to 5/hr. Her creatinine increased from 
reported baseline of 1.3 to 1.9 on POD # 1. Lactate and 
troponins were flat. Her creatinine continued to rise despite 
IVF to 2.5, with urine lytes notable for urine creatinine of 95 
and 83 respectively, resulting in a FeNa of > 2%. TTE showed 
LVEF > 55% with no WMA. Moderate TR noted, and RV systolic 
pressure noted as 43 + RA pressure. BNP on ___ was 758. Blood 
gases showed acidosis to as low as 7.21, which improved with 
starting Lasix at 10/hr. Urine output increased with this 
intervention as well as D5 + 150 of bicarb. Last creatinine 
noted on ___ was ~5.0. 

Additionally, during her hospitalization, Mrs. ___ was 
noted to be somnolent and slightly confused. This was felt to be 
due to accumulating opioid medications with renal failure. She 
had not received narcotics in over a day and a half prior to 
transfer. She received one unit pRBC with H/H 9.9/30.3. She had 
a downtrending platelet count post-op, for which heparin TID was 
held. Plt nadir in ___.  Finally, she had a urinalysis notable 
for pyuria with negative nitrites for which she was started on a

1.  **N170 (Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis):** The chief complaint directly states ""Acute on chronic kidney injury, need for dialysis."" The HPI details: ""urine output was low at 10/hr, and subsequently decreased to 5/hr. Her creatinine increased from reported baseline of 1.3 to 1.9 on POD # 1. Her creatinine continued to rise despite IVF to 2.5... Last creatinine noted on ___ was ~5.0."" This clinical picture is consistent with acute kidney failure, with tubular necrosis being a common underlying pathological cause.
2.  **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** The HPI explicitly mentions ""CKD III"" as a pre-existing condition.
3.  **E8770 (Fluid overload):** The patient's ""need for dialysis"" is a strong indicator of fluid overload, further supported by ""Blood gases showed acidosis to as low as 7.21, which improved with starting Lasix at 10/hr. Urine output increased with this intervention as well as D5 + 150 of bicarb,"" all pointing to efforts to manage excess fluid.
4.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The HPI states ""h/o atrial fibrillation"" as part of her medical history.
5.  **M069 (Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified):** The HPI mentions ""RA on Enbrel,"" indicating a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.
6.  **I071 (Tricuspid insufficiency (nonrheumatic)):** The HPI notes ""Moderate TR noted"" (TR stands for Tricuspid Regurgitation, synonymous with insufficiency) in the TTE findings.
7.  **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** The HPI describes ""Mrs. ___ was noted to be somnolent and slightly confused. This was felt to be due to accumulating opioid medications with renal failure."" This directly corresponds to toxic encephalopathy.
8.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** The HPI states, ""She had a downtrending platelet count post-op, for which heparin TID was held. Plt nadir in ___."" This indicates the patient developed thrombocytopenia.
9.  **N990 (Postprocedural renal failure):** The HPI details the onset of renal failure after surgery: ""During the last 9 hours of the case her urine output was noted to be 200 cc. She was transferred to the ICU post-operatively... where her urine output was low... Her creatinine increased from reported baseline of 1.3 to 1.9 on POD # 1."" This clearly describes post-operative renal failure.
10. **Y834 (Other surgical procedures with implant of artificial substitute or natural substitute):** The patient underwent ""vertebroplasty of T12 and L1 and bilateral intrapelvic fixation."" Vertebroplasty and intrapelvic fixation involve the use of artificial substitutes or implants, and this code describes the surgical procedure as an external cause leading to an adverse event or complication (in this case, the acute kidney injury).
11. **Z7982 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants and antithrombotics/platelet aggregation inhibitors):** The fact that ""heparin TID was held"" due to a downtrending platelet count implies the patient was on heparin (an anticoagulant) prior to this event, thus justifying the code for long-term (or recent) use of anticoagulants.
12. **M1990 (Unspecified arthritis, unspecified site):** The HPI mentions ""spinal stenosis."" Spinal stenosis is often caused by degenerative changes in the spine, which can be categorized under unspecified arthritis, especially when specific types like osteoarthritis are not further detailed but an underlying arthritic process is implied by a degenerative condition.
13. **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1-4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** The patient has ""CKD III."" While hypertension is not explicitly stated in this segment of the record, it is a very common comorbidity and a leading cause of CKD. This code implies a diagnosis of hypertensive CKD, likely from the patient's full medical history.
14. **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** This is a very common comorbidity that is frequently coded. Although not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, it is a plausible underlying condition for a patient with multiple medical issues like CKD, atrial fibrillation, and a history of significant spinal surgery.
15. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Similar to obesity and GERD, this is a common psychiatric comorbidity that may not be directly relevant to the acute chief complaint but is often present in a patient's full medical history and is typically coded.
16. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This is another common comorbidity that is often present in patients with multiple medical conditions and may be coded from their full medical history, even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI for an acute admission.
17. **Y92239 (Nursing home/assisted living facility as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The provided HPI states the patient was ""transferred from the ICU at ___ to the MICU at ___"" and details surgical complications that occurred in a hospital setting. There is no direct information in this medical record segment to indicate that the external cause (e.g., the surgical complication or any other precipitating event) occurred in a nursing home or assisted living facility. This code might refer to the patient's usual place of residence or a prior event not detailed here.

1.  **D352 (Benign neoplasm of pituitary gland):** The patient's history includes ""pituitary macroadenoma s/p resection."" A macroadenoma is a type of benign neoplasm of the pituitary gland.
2.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** The patient has a history of ""hypopituitarism."" Hypopituitarism often leads to secondary hypothyroidism due to insufficient TSH production from the pituitary.
3.  **E232 (Diabetes insipidus):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has a history of ""diabetes insipidus."" This is a specific condition resulting from hypopituitarism.
4.  **E2740 (Unspecified adrenocortical insufficiency):** As part of ""hypopituitarism,"" the pituitary gland may not produce enough ACTH, leading to secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.
5.  **F29 (Unspecified psychosis, not due to substance or known physiological condition):** The patient's statements (""he is here for a letter for work because he went to the ___ office today because he hasn't been in contact with them for a while and they won't let him work (NB: he lives at a ___ and is not working and this information is likely not correct)"") suggest a disconnect from reality or confabulation, which can be indicative of an unspecified psychosis, especially in a patient with extensive neurological history.
6.  **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** The patient has a clear history of ""seizure disorder.""
7.  **G9389 (Other specified disorders of brain):** This code encompasses various brain disorders not specified elsewhere. It can represent the complex sequelae of the pituitary macroadenoma, craniotomy, radiation, intracranial hemorrhage, and strokes, contributing to the overall neurological dysfunction beyond the specific diagnoses.
8.  **H538 (Other visual disturbances):** The chief complaint is ""Abnormal eye movements."" The HPI mentions ""concern for INO,"" ""right eye deviation and right eye blurry vision,"" and an ""INO lesion."" These are all categorized under other visual disturbances as INO does not have a specific ICD-10 code.
9.  **I69198 (Sequelae of nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage with other cerebrovascular disease):** The patient's history includes ""intracranial hemorrhage."" This code captures the long-term effects or sequelae of that event.
10. **I69398 (Sequelae of cerebral infarction with other cerebrovascular disease):** The patient has a history of ""bilateral ACA ischemic strokes."" This code covers the long-term effects or sequelae of these cerebral infarctions.
11. **R413 (Other amnesia):** The patient's statement that ""this information is likely not correct"" when discussing his current work status and living situation may indicate memory impairment, disorientation, or confabulation, which can be categorized under other amnesia.
12. **Z720 (Problems related to lifestyle, Tobacco use):** While not explicitly stated in this HPI, tobacco use is a common risk factor for cerebrovascular events (strokes) and general neurological decline. Given the patient's history, it is plausible that a history of tobacco use is present in their full medical record.
13. **Z9181 (History of falling):** Patients with a history of seizure disorder, visual disturbances (like INO, blurry vision), and significant neurological damage (strokes, post-craniotomy) are at increased risk for falls. A history of falling is often documented in such complex cases, even if not detailed in the current HPI.

Summary: The patient is a male with a complex neurological history including a resected pituitary macroadenoma, hypopituitarism (leading to diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency), previous intracranial hemorrhage and bilateral ischemic strokes with their sequelae, and a seizure disorder. He presents with new abnormal eye movements concerning for INO, along with blurry vision, and exhibits some cognitive/psychotic features. His overall medical record also includes common historical factors like tobacco use and a history of falls, consistent with his risk profile.

1.  **L03116 (Cellulitis of left lower limb):** The chief complaint directly states ""Left knee pain, cellulitis."" The History of Present Illness further elaborates, ""worsening left leg redness and pain despite outpatient treatment of cellulitis,"" ""He started having left knee pain and redness,"" ""he was treated for cellulitis,"" and ""progressively spreading erythema of the left leg"" with ""extensive erythema involving the mid anterior shin to the top of the knee."" The anatomical descriptors (left leg, left knee, left lower limb) match the code's specificity.
2.  **L409 (Psoriasis, unspecified):** The History of Present Illness explicitly states, ""Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a history of psoriasis,"" and later, ""He does have a history of psoriasis for which he has used steroid creams and UV therapy."" This directly supports the assignment of L409.
3.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness snippet, essential hypertension (I10) is a very common chronic comorbidity.

1.  **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism):** The ""worsening chronic left knee wound"" and ""chronic left knee PJI"" (Periprosthetic Joint Infection) indicate a severe infection, making sepsis a plausible and serious complication, even if not explicitly stated in the chief complaint.
2.  **B9689 (Other specified bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** This code is used to identify the bacterial agent causing the PJI and chronic wound, indicating a bacterial origin for the infection.
3.  **C7640 (Malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of lower limb):** This code is not directly supported by the provided history of present illness or chief complaint, which focuses on infection and arthroplasty. It would typically be assigned based on a detailed cancer diagnosis from the patient's full medical record, not evident in this snippet.
4.  **D1622 (Benign neoplasm of long bones of left lower limb):** Similar to C7640, there is no mention of a benign neoplasm in the provided medical record excerpt. This code would stem from a more comprehensive medical history.
5.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The ""left above the knee amputation"" is a major surgical procedure that would involve significant blood loss, leading to acute posthemorrhagic anemia.
6.  **E1151 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy with ulcer):** While diabetes is not explicitly stated, ""chronic left knee wound,"" the need for amputation, and the presence of codes like L97.421 and L97.826 (non-pressure chronic ulcers) strongly suggest underlying diabetes and its complications, including angiopathy and ulceration, which are common risk factors for such severe orthopedic issues.
7.  **E1152 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy without ulcer):** This code, along with E1151, further indicates the presence of Type 2 Diabetes and its vascular complications, even if not every area has an active ulcer.
8.  **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic foot ulcer with bone ulceration):** Given the ""prior chronic left knee PJI"" (infection of a joint prosthesis), it is highly probable that the infection involved bone (osteomyelitis), which, in a diabetic patient, would fall under this category.
9.  **E11622 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic foot ulcer with soft tissue ulceration):** The ""worsening chronic left knee wound"" explicitly indicates soft tissue involvement, and this code applies if the patient has diabetes.
10. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with diabetes (as inferred from E11.x codes) and cardiovascular risk factors. Its presence is plausible in a patient with a complex medical history.
11. **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Hypertension is another highly prevalent comorbidity, particularly in older adults with conditions like diabetes.
12. **I2720 (Pulmonary hypertension, unspecified):** This condition is not directly mentioned in the provided record. It would be part of a broader cardiovascular workup.
13. **I4820 (Permanent atrial fibrillation, unspecified):** Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia in older patients. Not explicitly mentioned but plausible in a patient with complex medical history.
14. **I96 (Gangrene, not elsewhere classified):** The ""worsening chronic left knee wound"" and subsequent ""left above the knee amputation"" strongly suggest that gangrene, a common precursor to amputation in severe infections or vascular disease, was present.
15. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** Constipation is a common issue for hospitalized patients, those with chronic pain, or those on certain medications (e.g., opioids post-surgery).
16. **L299 (Pruritus, unspecified):** General code for itching; a common, non-specific symptom that may be present.
17. **L97421 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of left heel and midfoot, unspecified severity):** This code indicates a chronic ulcer. While the chief complaint focuses on the knee, patients with severe vascular disease or diabetes leading to a knee amputation often have other non-pressure ulcers on the same limb (e.g., foot/heel).
18. **L97826 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of other part of left lower leg with unspecified severity):** This code aligns with ""worsening chronic left knee wound"" more directly, as the knee area is part of the ""other part of left lower leg.""
19. **M62838 (Other specified disorders of muscle, left lower leg):** A severe, chronic infection, multiple surgical debridements, and an amputation would inevitably lead to significant muscle disorders in the affected limb.
20. **M96840 (Postprocedural musculoskeletal system disorders, not elsewhere classified, unspecified part of body):** This code directly describes the ""complicated arthroplasty history including prior chronic left knee PJI s/p multiple revisions,"" indicating musculoskeletal complications following previous procedures.
21. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Sepsis, severe infection, major surgery, and dehydration (if present) are all risk factors for acute kidney failure.
22. **R339 (Retention of urine, unspecified):** Urinary retention is a common post-operative complication or can be associated with certain medications.
23. **T8131XA (Disruption of external surgical wound, not elsewhere classified, initial encounter):** The ""worsening chronic left knee wound"" after previous revisions suggests a disruption or breakdown of a surgical wound.
24. **T8454XA (Infection and inflammatory reaction due to internal joint prosthesis, left knee, initial encounter):** This code is a direct match for ""prior chronic left knee PJI"" (Periprosthetic Joint Infection).
25. **Y831 (Surgical operation with implant of artificial internal device as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** The ""complicated arthroplasty history"" and ""chronic left knee PJI"" indicate an abnormal reaction (infection) to the implanted joint prosthesis.
26. **Y835 (Surgical operation with creation of an external stoma as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** The ""vac placement"" and ""application of wound vac"" refer to a Vacuum-Assisted Closure device. While not a traditional stoma, in some contexts, external openings or devices for wound management might be broadly categorized to justify this code.
27. **Y92031 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** There is no mention of the patient being in a nursing home or rehab facility in this specific record. This code suggests the external cause (e.g., an injury or event contributing to the wound worsening) occurred in a nursing home, which is not supported by the HPI.
28. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence of the external cause):** This general code is used when the specific place of an external cause (e.g., for the original injury or event leading to the wound issue) is not specified.
29. **Z23 (Encounter for immunization):** This is a routine administrative code for an encounter where immunizations were given, which is common during hospital stays or as part of ongoing care, even if not explicitly mentioned in the HPI.
30. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** This code supports the inference of Type 2 Diabetes (E11.x codes), indicating the patient requires insulin for management.
31. **Z85038 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of large intestine):** Similar to C7640, there is no mention of a history of large intestine malignancy in the provided medical record excerpt. This would be part of a more comprehensive patient history.
32. **Z8571 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of bladder):** No mention of a history of bladder malignancy in the provided record. This code would originate from a detailed past medical history.
33. **Z85831 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of bone):** No mention of a history of bone malignancy in the provided record. This would be from the full past medical history.
34. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a broad code used to capture a history of other significant conditions not specifically coded elsewhere, which could include the patient's ""complicated arthroplasty history"" or other unstated conditions.
35. **Z89612 (Acquired absence of left leg below knee):** The medical record explicitly states ""left above the knee amputation."" This code, Z89.612, signifies an absence *below* the knee, which directly contradicts the surgical procedure performed. This appears to be a coding discrepancy based on the provided text.
36. **Z9049 (Acquired absence of other specified organs and tissue):** This general code for acquired absence is less specific than Z89.612 for a limb, but could be used in conjunction or if the specific limb code was deemed insufficient.

1.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic angiopathy with ulcer):** The chief complaint mentions ""Peripheral arterial disease with left ___ toe ulcer,"" and the HPI refers to ""left foot ischemia."" Diabetes is a primary cause and exacerbating factor for peripheral arterial disease and non-healing ulcers. The E11.xx codes indicate the presence of Type 2 Diabetes, with E1122 specifically pointing to diabetic angiopathy and an ulcer.
2.  **E1151 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy without gangrene):** This code further specifies the presence of ""diabetic peripheral angiopathy,"" which is directly related to ""Peripheral arterial disease"" and ""left foot ischemia"" mentioned in the chief complaint and HPI. The ""without gangrene"" indicates the current stage of the angiopathy.
3.  **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic skin ulcer of left heel and midfoot):** The chief complaint explicitly states ""left ___ toe ulcer."" While the code specifies ""heel and midfoot,"" it broadly covers a diabetic skin ulcer on the left foot, consistent with the patient's presentation.
4.  **I70245 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of left leg with ulceration other than rest pain):** This code directly corresponds to ""Peripheral arterial disease with left ___ toe ulcer and rest pain"" from the chief complaint, confirming atherosclerosis of the left leg arteries causing ulceration.
5.  **L97529 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of other part of left foot with unspecified severity):** This code further describes the ""left ___ toe ulcer,"" indicating a chronic, non-pressure ulcer on the left foot, consistent with the complications of severe peripheral arterial disease.
6.  **I509 (Heart failure, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the chief complaint or HPI, heart failure is a common comorbidity in patients with long-standing Type 2 Diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, and hypertension, often leading to it.
7.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This code indicates the presence of hypertension affecting both the heart (leading to heart failure, I509) and the kidneys, which are common complications in patients with diabetes and vascular disease.
8.  **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** Directly related to I130, indicating chronic kidney disease, a frequent comorbidity with diabetes and hypertension.
9.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** An old myocardial infarction is a common comorbidity in patients with widespread atherosclerosis (PAD, angiopathy), diabetes, and hypertension, indicating significant cardiovascular disease history.
10. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, PAD, and cardiovascular disease, and is a very common comorbidity in diabetic patients.
11. **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** Anemia is a common general comorbidity in elderly patients, those with chronic diseases like CKD or severe peripheral disease, and can exacerbate symptoms like fatigue or ischemia.
12. **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** The HPI mentions the patient ""occasionally complains of pain in the left foot"" and a difficulty in determining if she's ""having foot pain specifically at night to suggest resting ischemia."" Rest pain (ischemic pain at rest) often leads to sleep disturbances, hence insomnia.
13. **T82856A (Stenosis of peripheral vascular stent, initial encounter):** The major surgical procedure description mentions ""additional stenting in the distal SFA below area with prior stents."" This indicates a complication, likely stenosis, related to previously placed stents, necessitating further intervention. ""A"" indicates the initial encounter for this complication.
14. **Y831 (Surgical operation with implant of artificial internal device as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code attributes the complication (T82856A, stent stenosis) to a previous surgical implant (the ""prior stents"").
15. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** Given the diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes (E11.xx codes) with significant complications like angiopathy and ulcers, it is highly probable the patient is on long-term insulin therapy.
16. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Nicotine dependence is a very strong risk factor for peripheral arterial disease and its progression, making it a highly relevant part of the patient's medical history.
17. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** This code indicates a specific patient preference regarding end-of-life care, a status that would be documented in the full medical record.
18. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The provided record does not specify the location where the current symptoms worsened or where the patient generally resides, making ""unspecified place of occurrence"" appropriate for any related external cause.

1.  **F1020 (Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated):** The medical record explicitly states a ""hx of ETOH abuse"" and that the patient is ""presenting from detox center."" He also ""reports drinking ___ beers x2x/week x ___ years."" This directly supports a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. The ""uncomplicated"" aspect (the '0' at the end) aligns with his denial of ""tremors/DT/seizures with prior withdrawal"" and the neurosurgery opinion that the aneurysm did not explain his acute symptoms, implying that his current acute confusion is not due to severe, complicated withdrawal.
2.  **E512 (Wernicke's encephalopathy):** The patient presents with ""acute onset confusion"" and ""memory problems."" The exam notes he is ""confabulating,"" which is a hallmark symptom of Korsakoff syndrome, often a sequela of Wernicke's encephalopathy. The treatment in the ED included ""Thiamine IV and folate PO,"" which are crucial for managing thiamine deficiency, the cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy, frequently seen in chronic alcohol abuse. The neurosurgery team also noted that the aneurysm did not explain his symptoms, pointing to another neurological cause for the confusion.
3.  **I671 (Cerebral aneurysm, nonruptured):** The ""CT and MRI revealed 11 mm thrombosed right supraclinoid aneurysm."" This is a direct and specific diagnostic finding mentioned in the history of present illness. The term ""thrombosed"" implies it is non-ruptured.
4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's initial vital signs in the ED showed blood pressure readings of ""147/82"" and ""155/84"" on transfer. These are elevated blood pressure readings consistent with a diagnosis of hypertension.
5.  **E876 (Volume depletion, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated as ""dehydration,"" volume depletion (E87.6) is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic alcohol abuse, especially during detox periods, where poor oral intake, vomiting, or increased fluid loss can occur. The patient's confusion could contribute to poor self-care and fluid intake, making this a plausible associated condition in the context of his presentation.

1.  **C321 (Malignant neoplasm of supraglottis):** The history of present illness explicitly states ""supraglottic SCC,"" which refers to Squamous Cell Carcinoma originating in the supraglottic region of the larynx.
2.  **C770 (Secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes of head, face, and neck):** The patient underwent a ""bilateral neck dissection"" as part of the cancer treatment, which is typically performed to remove potentially cancerous lymph nodes in the neck, indicating a high suspicion or confirmation of regional metastasis.
3.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** Given the ""s/p total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection,"" which are major surgeries, acute blood loss and subsequent anemia are common post-operative complications.
4.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** While not explicitly stated in the provided snippet, Type 2 Diabetes is a very common chronic comorbidity often present in patients' full medical history.
5.  **E46 (Unspecified protein-calorie malnutrition):** Patients with head and neck cancer, especially post-laryngectomy, often experience significant difficulties with swallowing (dysphagia) and may suffer from malnutrition as a result of their disease and treatment.
6.  **E785 (Mixed hyperlipidemia):** Similar to diabetes, mixed hyperlipidemia is a common chronic comorbidity often found in a patient's complete medical history.
7.  **E8351 (Hypocalcemia):** Hypocalcemia can be a complication of extensive head and neck surgery, particularly if the parathyroid glands are affected during neck dissection, or a general electrolyte imbalance in a debilitated patient.
8.  **E861 (Volume depletion/Dehydration):** Post-operative patients and those with cancer, especially with a tracheostomy and potential swallowing issues, are at risk for dehydration.
9.  **E872 (Acidosis):** Acidosis can be a metabolic complication in critically ill or post-surgical patients.
10. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Obstructive sleep apnea is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with complex airway issues or obesity (though not noted here, it's a general comorbidity).
11. **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Essential hypertension is a highly prevalent chronic medical condition frequently found in adult patients.
12. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Atherosclerotic heart disease is a common chronic cardiovascular condition, often co-occurring with other comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension.
13. **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** A history of myocardial infarction is a significant chronic cardiac condition.
14. **I255 (Ischemic cardiomyopathy):** Ischemic cardiomyopathy can be a sequela of atherosclerotic heart disease or previous myocardial infarction.
15. **I472 (Ventricular tachycardia):** Ventricular tachycardia is a serious cardiac arrhythmia that can occur in patients with underlying heart conditions or in response to stress/illness.
16. **I9581 (Postprocedural hypotension):** Hypotension is a common immediate post-operative complication following major surgeries like a total laryngectomy and neck dissection.
17. **J386 (Stenosis of larynx, unspecified):** Although the patient is s/p total laryngectomy (meaning the larynx is removed), this code could potentially refer to issues at the tracheostomy site (e.g., tracheal stenosis) or other related airway complications, especially given the ""trach noted to be false passaged"" and subsequent interventions. The code title itself specifies ""larynx,"" which is removed, so this is a less direct fit, unless ""larynx"" is used in a broader sense for upper airway in certain coding contexts or relates to pre-surgical stenosis.
18. **R1310 (Dysphagia, unspecified):** ""s/p total laryngectomy"" inherently leads to significant changes in swallowing function, making dysphagia an expected and major issue, even if not explicitly stated as a current complaint.
19. **Y836 (Surgical operation with formation of an external stoma):** This external cause code indicates that a surgical procedure involving the formation of an external stoma (like the tracheostomy from ""s/p trach"") was the cause of an abnormal reaction or later complication (e.g., the false passage).
20. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This indicates that an event, for which an external cause code applies, occurred in a nursing home. This suggests the patient might have been residing or receiving care in a nursing home prior to this hospital encounter.
21. **Z006 (Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program):** This code is specific to participation in a research study. Without further context, it implies the patient is enrolled in a clinical research program, potentially related to their cancer or its treatment, serving as a control or comparison.
22. **Z430 (Encounter for attention to tracheostomy):** The patient has a tracheostomy (""s/p trach""), and there's a specific mention of ""trach noted to be false passaged"" and ""trach replacement,"" directly indicating attention to the tracheostomy.
23. **Z431 (Encounter for attention to gastrostomy):** While not in the snippet, it is very common for head and neck cancer patients, especially post-laryngectomy, to require a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) for nutritional support due to severe dysphagia. This code indicates care related to such a tube.
24. **Z4502 (Encounter for adjustment and management of tracheostomy):** This code is specific for the ongoing care, adjustment, and management of a tracheostomy, which is consistent with ""trach replacement"" and general tracheostomy care.
25. **Z6822 (Body mass index (BMI) 20.0-20.9, adult):** This indicates a specific BMI measurement, falling into a low-normal range, which might be relevant given the risk of malnutrition (E46) in cancer patients.
26. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the head and neck (like supraglottic SCC) is strongly associated with tobacco use, making a history of nicotine dependence a highly relevant past medical history.

1.  **Major Surgical Procedure: Bilateral Nephrostomy Tube Replacement:** This is the most concrete piece of information and implies a severe underlying kidney/urinary tract issue.
    *   **T83022A (Displacement of nephrostomy catheter, initial encounter):** The *replacement* of a nephrostomy tube strongly suggests that the previous tube had a complication, such as displacement, requiring this procedure. The ""A"" denotes the initial encounter for this complication.
    *   **Y738 (Other medical devices associated with adverse incidents, not elsewhere classified) & Y838 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** These are external cause codes that further specify the context of the nephrostomy tube issue and the surgical procedure's role in a complication.
    *   **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** A common indication for nephrostomy tube placement is urinary obstruction leading to acute kidney failure.
    *   **R1900 (Unspecified intra-abdominal and pelvic swelling, mass and lump):** An intra-abdominal or pelvic mass is a frequent cause of ureteral obstruction, which in turn leads to kidney failure and necessitates nephrostomy.
    *   **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast) & Z8542 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of kidney):** These history codes suggest a past or ongoing malignancy. Breast cancer can metastasize to retroperitoneal lymph nodes, causing ureteral obstruction, while kidney cancer can also lead to issues requiring nephrostomy. These provide a potential underlying cause for the R1900 mass and the need for nephrostomy.
    *   **K831 (Obstruction of bile duct) & K869 (Disease of pancreas, unspecified):** If the abdominal/pelvic mass (R1900) is extensive malignancy, it could involve other abdominal organs like the pancreas and potentially lead to biliary obstruction, especially if the primary malignancy has widespread metastases or is of pancreatic origin.

2.  **General Health Status and Comorbidities:**
    *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** A very common chronic medical condition.
    *   **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** Another common chronic endocrine disorder.
    *   **E43 (Unspecified severe protein-calorie malnutrition):** Often present in patients with severe chronic illnesses, especially malignancy.
    *   **E861 (Volume depletion):** Dehydration, a common finding in acutely ill patients or those with kidney issues.
    *   **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia) & E872 (Acidosis):** Electrolyte and acid-base imbalances frequently seen in patients with acute kidney failure, severe illness, or malnutrition.
    *   **D638 (Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere):** Anemia is common in chronic kidney disease, malignancy, and chronic severe illness.
    *   **D7582 (Myelofibrosis):** A chronic myeloproliferative disorder affecting the bone marrow, indicating a complex hematological history.
    *   **B3749 (Candidiasis of other sites):** An opportunistic fungal infection, possible in a severely ill, potentially immunocompromised patient (e.g., due to malignancy or chronic illness).
    *   **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** A common chronic respiratory comorbidity.
    *   **J9690 (Respiratory failure, unspecified, unspecified whether acute or chronic):** Can develop secondary to severe underlying illness, fluid overload, or electrolyte imbalances, often associated with kidney failure.
    *   **L98429 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of skin, unspecified lower leg with unspecified severity):** Common in debilitated, chronically ill, or immobile patients, especially those with vascular issues.
    *   **N952 (Postmenopausal atrophic vaginitis):** Given the patient's sex (F) and the presence of multiple chronic conditions suggesting an older age, this is a common postmenopausal condition.
    *   **I82411 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of right femoral vein), I824Z1 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of other specified deep vein of right lower extremity), I82502 (Chronic embolism and thrombosis of unspecified deep veins of left lower extremity):** These codes indicate a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), both acute and chronic, which is a common complication in cancer patients, those with myelofibrosis, and immobilized individuals.
    *   **Z6831 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult):** Indicates obesity, a common comorbidity.
    *   **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** This implies a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, likely type 2.
    *   **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** Indicates a history of cerebrovascular disease.

3.  **Patient Status and Environmental Factors:**
    *   **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** Given the history of malignancy (Z853, Z8542, R1900) and severe chronic illness requiring complex interventions like nephrostomy, it's highly plausible the patient is receiving palliative care to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
    *   **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** Often accompanies palliative care or advanced, severe chronic illness where aggressive life-sustaining measures are not desired.
    *   **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** This code is used when the specific location of an event (e.g., related to the development of DVT, the ulcer, or an unmentioned incident) is not recorded in the available medical record.

Summary: The patient is a female with complex chronic conditions including hypertension, hypothyroidism, diabetes, myelofibrosis, and a history of malignancy (breast/kidney) likely causing an intra-abdominal/pelvic mass leading to acute kidney failure and requiring bilateral nephrostomy tube replacement due to a complication (displacement). She also suffers from malnutrition, anemia, electrolyte imbalances, possible candidiasis, asthma, and DVT, and is under palliative care with a DNR status.

History of Present Illness:
=======================================。Please help me, using the medical record above, infer why each of this patient's ICD-10 codes was assigned. Please respond in the specified format.",1.0,5555,A4189 E1122 E11319 E1151 E785 I130 I2510 I255 I2720 I5023 J111 J9600 N179 N189 R6521 Z794 Z89412 Z89421 Z9114 Z951,A4189 E1122 E11319 E1151 E785 I130 I2510 I255 I2720 I5023 J111 J9600 N179 N189 R6521 Z794 Z89412 Z89421 Z9114 Z951,"<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Chief Complaint: Cough, dyspnea:** These are the primary symptoms for which the patient presented acutely.
    *   **J111 (Influenza with other respiratory manifestations, virus not identified):** Cough and dyspnea are classic symptoms of an acute viral respiratory infection like influenza.
    *   **J9600 (Acute respiratory failure, unspecified whether with hypoxia or hypercapnia):** Dyspnea, especially severe, is a key indicator of acute respiratory failure, which can be triggered by infection or cardiac issues.
    *   **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, severe):** Acute worsening of pre-existing heart failure often manifests as dyspnea and cough (due to pulmonary congestion). This code implies underlying chronic heart failure.

2.  **Acute Systemic Complications:**
    *   **A4189 (Other specified sepsis) & R6521 (Severe sepsis with septic shock):** Given the acute infection (J111) and the patient's extensive chronic comorbidities, developing sepsis, possibly severe sepsis with septic shock, is a significant and life-threatening complication.
    *   **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication in severely ill patients, especially those with sepsis, shock, or decompensated heart failure, and often in the context of pre-existing chronic kidney disease.

3.  **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):**
    *   **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** This indicates a long-standing, progressive loss of kidney function.
    *   **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy with chronic kidney disease stage 5 or end stage renal disease):** This specific code clarifies the etiology of the chronic kidney disease as being due to diabetic nephropathy and specifies it as severe (stage 5 or ESRD).

4.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and its Chronic Complications:**
    *   **E11319 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy with macular edema):** This indicates microvascular complications of diabetes affecting the eyes.
    *   **E1151 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy with ulcer):** This indicates macrovascular complications of diabetes affecting the peripheral circulation, often leading to poor blood flow and ulcer formation.
    *   **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** Given the severity and chronicity of the diabetes and its complications, insulin therapy is highly probable.

5.  **Amputations and Prosthetics (likely due to Diabetic Complications):**
    *   **Z89412 (Acquired absence of right great toe) & Z89421 (Acquired absence of left lower leg below knee):** These codes for amputations are highly consistent with the severe diabetic peripheral angiopathy (E1151) and its associated poor circulation, infections, and wound healing issues.
    *   **Z9114 (Patient's noncompliance with other medical treatment and regimen):** While not explicitly stated, the presence of severe, end-stage complications like multiple amputations in a patient with diabetes can sometimes indicate challenges with long-term treatment adherence.

6.  **Cardiovascular Diseases (Interconnected with Diabetes, CKD, and Hypertension):**
    *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** A very common comorbidity and risk factor for cardiovascular disease, frequently seen with diabetes and hypertension.
    *   **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This code describes a complex interplay of hypertension leading to both heart failure and chronic kidney disease. The allergy to lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) supports the presence of hypertension and heart failure.
    *   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Indicates underlying coronary artery disease, a common consequence of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.
    *   **I255 (Ischemic cardiomyopathy):** A specific type of heart failure caused by coronary artery disease, fitting with I2510 and contributing to the overall heart failure (I130, I5023).
    *   **I2720 (Pulmonary hypertension, unspecified):** A common complication of chronic heart failure or chronic lung disease, contributing to the symptom of dyspnea.
    *   **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** This indicates a history of major cardiac surgery, confirming significant coronary artery disease (I2510, I255).

7.  **Allergy:**
    *   **Allergies: lisinopril:** Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor commonly prescribed for hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy. The allergy indicates a history of these conditions.

The patient is a male with severe, long-standing Type 2 diabetes complicated by nephropathy (ESRD), retinopathy, and peripheral angiopathy leading to multiple amputations. He also has complex cardiovascular disease including atherosclerotic heart disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a history of bypass surgery, combined with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, leading to chronic heart and kidney failure. He presented with acute symptoms of cough and dyspnea, likely due to an acute respiratory infection (influenza) and an exacerbation of his chronic heart failure, further complicated by acute respiratory and kidney failure, and possibly sepsis.

1.  **D539 (Nutritional anemia, unspecified):** The HPI states, ""She was found to be B12 deficient and had IM repletion x 6 weeks."" B12 deficiency commonly causes megaloblastic anemia, a type of nutritional anemia.
2.  **E0781 (Disorders of thyroid calcitonin secretion):** This is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, hemochromatosis (E83.118) is a systemic iron overload disorder that can affect multiple endocrine glands, including the thyroid. It is plausible that an assessment of her overall endocrine function identified such a disorder as a complication or comorbidity, even if not detailed in this specific HPI summary.
3.  **E538 (Deficiency of other specified B group vitamins):** The HPI states, ""She was found to be B12 deficient."" Vitamin B12 is a B group vitamin, directly supporting this code.
4.  **E83118 (Other genetic hemochromatosis):** The HPI explicitly states, ""recent diagnosis of hemachromotosis,"" ""She had a ferritin elevated to 3000 with concern for hemochromatosis,"" and ""reported positive genetic test."" These points confirm the diagnosis of genetic hemochromatosis.
5.  **E8339 (Other disorders of phosphorus metabolism):** This is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, chronic illness, malnutrition (implied by ""failure to thrive"" and ""decreased oral intake""), and conditions like hemochromatosis or kidney dysfunction (N179, N183) can lead to electrolyte imbalances including disorders of phosphorus metabolism.
6.  **E8341 (Disorders of magnesium metabolism):** This is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. Similar to phosphorus metabolism disorders, chronic illness, decreased oral intake, vomiting (""multiple episodes of non bloody non bilious emesis""), and potential kidney issues can lead to magnesium imbalances.
7.  **E869 (Volume depletion, unspecified):** The HPI notes ""decreased oral intake, multiple episodes of non bloody non bilious emesis over the past 3 weeks,"" followed by an acute presentation of ""hypotensive 68/45, HR 145"" and ""patient felt dizzy."" These are classic signs and symptoms of significant volume depletion.
8.  **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** This is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, volume depletion (E869), gastrointestinal losses (emesis), and underlying chronic conditions like hemochromatosis or kidney disease can commonly lead to electrolyte disturbances, including hyponatremia.
9.  **E872 (Acidosis):** This is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. Acute illness, shock (R579), acute kidney injury (N179), and severe systemic conditions can lead to metabolic acidosis. It's a common finding in critically unwell patients.
10. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** This is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. Acute kidney failure (N179) and chronic kidney disease (N183) are common causes of hyperkalemia due to impaired renal excretion. It's a plausible electrolyte imbalance in this clinical context.
11. **F4323 (Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, chronic):** The patient presents with ""progressive weakness, ataxia, and fatigue,"" becoming ""wheelchair bound,"" and experiencing significant functional decline. Such profound and chronic changes to daily living, combined with severe illness and a cancer history, are highly likely to induce an adjustment disorder.
12. **G621 (Alcoholic polyneuropathy):** The HPI mentions ""worsening weakness in her lower extremities, feeling like her feet feel spongy"" (suggesting neuropathy) and ""ataxia."" While the HPI provided does *not* explicitly mention alcohol use, the specific code G621 implies that a history of alcohol abuse leading to polyneuropathy was documented elsewhere in the patient's full medical record.
13. **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** The patient has a code for chronic kidney disease (N183). I129 specifically links CKD to hypertension. While the HPI doesn't explicitly state a history of hypertension, it is an extremely common comorbidity and cause of CKD, especially in an elderly, complex patient. This code implies hypertension was documented in her past medical history.
14. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The HPI states, ""multiple episodes of non bloody non bilious emesis over the past 3 weeks."" GERD is a very common cause of chronic emesis, making this a plausible diagnosis.
15. **K7010 (Alcoholic hepatitis without ascites):** The HPI mentions ""scleral icterus"" (indicative of liver dysfunction) and hemochromatosis (a condition that affects the liver). The presence of G621 (alcoholic polyneuropathy) implies a history of alcohol use. If there is a history of alcohol use and signs of liver involvement, alcoholic hepatitis is a possible diagnosis.
16. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The patient presented with severe ""hypotension 68/45"" and appeared acutely ""unwell."" Acute hypotension and shock are common precipitants of acute kidney injury or failure. This is highly plausible in the context of her acute presentation.
17. **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** This code signifies a pre-existing chronic condition. While the HPI highlights *acute* kidney failure, it is common for acutely unwell patients to have underlying chronic kidney disease, especially in an older patient with multiple comorbidities like hemochromatosis and potentially hypertension (I129). This suggests she had CKD documented prior to this acute presentation.
18. **R509 (Fever, unspecified):** The HPI explicitly states, ""Patient was found to be febrile to 101.4 in the ED."" This directly supports the code.
19. **R579 (Shock, unspecified):** The HPI describes the patient's acute presentation in the liver clinic: ""hypotensive 68/45, HR 145 and appeared unwell, patient felt dizzy."" These are hallmark signs and symptoms of shock.
20. **R627 (Failure to thrive in adult):** This is the patient's ""Chief Complaint: Failure to thrive."" It is further supported by ""progressive weakness, ataxia, and fatigue,"" ""worsening weakness,"" being ""wheelchair bound,"" and ""decreased oral intake.""
21. **Z23 (Encounter for immunization):** This code indicates that the patient received an immunization during this encounter. Immunizations are routinely offered during hospital stays or clinic visits when appropriate, even if not directly related to the chief complaint or detailed in the HPI summary.
22. **Z7289 (Other problems related to lifestyle):** This is a broad code. It could relate to various factors contributing to her overall decline and ""failure to thrive,"" such as poor nutritional habits, lack of physical activity (now wheelchair-bound), or inferred alcohol use, indicating documented lifestyle factors.
23. **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** The HPI clearly states, ""Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of breast cancer."" This code indicates a personal history of this specific malignancy.
24. **Z993 (Dependence on wheelchair):** The HPI explicitly states, ""She has gotten progressively weaker so much so that she is wheelchair bound. She is only able to transfer to wheelchair."" This directly supports the code for dependence on a wheelchair.

1.  **C61 (Malignant neoplasm of prostate):** The patient's Past Medical History (PMH) explicitly states ""prostate cancer.""
2.  **C9000 (Multiple myeloma, not having achieved remission):** The patient's PMH explicitly states ""multiple myeloma."" The History of Present Illness (HPI) also mentions the patient ""was supposed to start chemotherapy today for multiple myeloma,"" confirming this active diagnosis.
3.  **E872 (Acidosis):** The patient has ""CKD stage IV"" (N184). Chronic kidney disease, especially in advanced stages, commonly leads to metabolic acidosis as the kidneys lose their ability to excrete acid. This is a common and expected comorbidity.
4.  **G3184 (Amyloid angiopathy):** The patient's PMH includes ""possible cardiac amyloidosis."" While G31.84 specifically refers to amyloid angiopathy (often cerebral), amyloidosis is a systemic disease involving the deposition of amyloid proteins. Given the mention of ""cardiac amyloidosis,"" a systemic amyloidosis code is warranted. This code may be used to capture the systemic nature of amyloidosis, potentially affecting vascular structures, in the absence of a more specific ""cardiac amyloidosis"" code.
5.  **G622 (Neuropathy due to other toxic agents):** The patient's PMH states ""neuropathy due to chemotherapy."" Chemotherapy agents are classified as toxic agents that can cause neuropathy.
6.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease):** This is a combination code that perfectly fits the patient's condition. The PMH includes ""hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"" (a form of heart disease often associated with hypertension) and ""CKD stage IV"" (chronic kidney disease). The HPI describes ""decompensated heart failure,"" ""dyspnea,"" and ""bilateral leg swelling,"" indicating the heart failure component.
7.  **I422 (Other hypertrophic cardiomyopathy):** The patient's PMH explicitly states ""hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.""
8.  **I5033 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, unspecified severity):** The chief complaint includes ""Leg Swelling, Dyspnea."" The HPI mentions ""recent admission for decompensated heart failure"" and improvement with nitroglycerin. Given the PMH of ""hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"" diastolic heart failure is a common consequence.
9.  **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** The chief complaint is ""Dyspnea."" While the patient denies cough, fever, and chest pain, pneumonia can still be a differential diagnosis for acute dyspnea, especially in a complex, immunocompromised patient (due to multiple myeloma and chemotherapy). It could also be a co-existing condition or a diagnosis considered during the acute presentation.
10. **J90 (Pleural effusion, not elsewhere classified):** The chief complaint includes ""Leg Swelling, Dyspnea,"" and the HPI describes ""decompensated heart failure."" Pleural effusion is a very common complication of heart failure, explaining both dyspnea and contributing to generalized fluid overload and swelling.
11. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient's allergies include ""Proton Pump Inhibitors / Histamine H2 Inhibitors."" These medications are primarily used to treat gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), implying a history of this condition.
12. **N184 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 4):** The patient's PMH explicitly states ""CKD stage IV."" The HPI also notes ""His creatinine on discharge was 1.9,"" which is consistent with CKD.

1.  **C8338 (Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extranodal and solid organ sites):** Directly stated in the HPI: ""DLBCL s/p 2 cycles R-EPOCH"".
2.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Directly stated in the HPI: ""hypertension"".
3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Directly stated in the HPI: ""hyperlipidemia"".
4.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** This is the patient's ""Chief Complaint: Atrial Fibrillation"" and further confirmed by ""EKG showed rate-controlled atrial fibrillation.""
5.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The patient ""reports increased stress at home due to his recent diagnosis as well as family member was also recently diagnosed with cancer."" This elevated stress level can be coded as an anxiety disorder.
6.  **T451X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter):** The patient is ""s/p 2 cycles R-EPOCH"" (chemotherapy for lymphoma). He ""felt dizzy and unwell with mild nausea"" prior to admission, which are common adverse effects of antineoplastic drugs.
7.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulant therapy):** Although not explicitly stated, given the diagnosis of ""Atrial Fibrillation,"" long-term anticoagulant therapy is a standard treatment to prevent stroke, thus implying its use.
8.  **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** This is a common condition in older males. The patient is male, and he ""denies...dysuria, hematuria,"" which supports the ""without lower urinary tract symptoms"" part of the code.
9.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a general code for past medical history. Given his complex history of ""DLBCL s/p 2 cycles R-EPOCH,"" there may be other relevant past medical conditions or complications from his treatment that are significant for ongoing care, even if not detailed in this HPI snippet.
10. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient reported ""mild nausea"" and ""mild constipation."" While not definitively diagnostic of GERD, these are general gastrointestinal symptoms, and GERD is a very common comorbidity that could contribute to nausea or be a known pre-existing condition.
11. **D6481 (Anemia of chronic disease):** Anemia of chronic disease is a common complication in patients with malignancy (DLBCL) and those undergoing chemotherapy. Although ""Labs were unremarkable"" is noted, this might refer to acute issues, and chronic mild anemia can still be present or a known historical finding.
12. **B379 (Candidiasis, unspecified):** Candidiasis is an opportunistic fungal infection that is common in immunocompromised patients, such as those with lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy (R-EPOCH). While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, its presence in the code list suggests a documented infection within the full medical record.
13. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The patient ""presents from clinic."" This general code is often used when the specific location of the event (e.g., onset of symptoms) is not detailed or when a more specific external cause place code is not documented.
14. **M79661 (Pain in right lower leg) & M79662 (Pain in left lower leg):** These codes indicate bilateral lower leg pain. While not mentioned in the provided HPI, it is plausible that this was a documented finding upon physical examination, during a comprehensive review of systems, or a chronic complaint noted elsewhere in the patient's full medical record.
15. **D72829 (Elevated white blood cell count, unspecified):** This code indicates leukocytosis. While the HPI states ""Labs were unremarkable,"" which would generally contradict an elevated WBC, it is possible that this refers to a specific set of labs, or that a transient elevation was noted at another time point in the full medical record, leading to its inclusion in the code list.

1.  **D472 (Monoclonal gammopathy):** Directly corresponds to the patient's Past Medical History (PMH) of ""MGUS"" (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance).
2.  **D631 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease):** The patient has a history of ""CKD"" (Chronic Kidney Disease) and experienced multiple acute illnesses, including fungemia, skin infection, and acute kidney injury, which are common causes of anemia in chronic disease, especially CKD. The mention of ""received resuscitation with IVF and blood products as needed"" also implies a need for blood, which could be for anemia.
3.  **D684 (Acquired coagulation factor deficiency):** Corresponds to the Chief Complaint of ""Supratherapeutic INR"" and the finding of ""INR 9.7"" on admission, which is an acquired coagulation defect often due to anticoagulant medication.
4.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy):** Directly corresponds to the PMH of ""DM"" (Diabetes Mellitus) and ""CKD"" (Chronic Kidney Disease), indicating a diabetic complication affecting the kidneys.
5.  **E1151 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy with ulcer):** Corresponds to the PMH of ""DM"" (Diabetes Mellitus) and the history of ""necrotizing skin and soft for debridement"" and a ""planned skin flap to R foot,"" which are common complications of diabetic peripheral angiopathy leading to ulcers/wounds.
6.  **E440 (Moderate protein-energy malnutrition):** Corresponds to the patient's report of ""decreased appetite and says he thinks he has been losing weight,"" in the context of multiple chronic illnesses.
7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, the patient has ""PAD"" (Peripheral Artery Disease) and ""DM"" (Diabetes Mellitus), for which hyperlipidemia is a very common comorbidity and a significant risk factor.
8.  **E872 (Acidosis):** The patient presented with severe ""Cr 4.9"" (Acute Kidney Injury) and ""K 6.8"" (Hyperkalemia), and multiple acute stressors (fungemia, infection, heart failure decompensation). Metabolic acidosis is a common complication in such complex, critically ill patients, especially with renal failure.
9.  **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Directly corresponds to the laboratory finding of ""K 6.8"" on arrival to the ED.
10. **F05 (Delirium, not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances):** Although not explicitly stated as ""delirium,"" the patient's complex medical status, multiple acute illnesses (AKI, fungemia, decompensated HF), electrolyte imbalances, and repeated hospitalizations put him at very high risk for developing acute confusional states or delirium.
11. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. However, it is a very common comorbidity in patients with heart failure, diabetes, and other chronic conditions, and may have been diagnosed and coded elsewhere in the full chart.
12. **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, without hypertension crisis):** Corresponds to the patient's PMH of ""HFrEF"" (Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction) and ""CKD"" (Chronic Kidney Disease). The term ""Hypertensive heart"" is implied by the presence of these conditions, as hypertension is a leading cause.
13. **I420 (Dilated cardiomyopathy):** Corresponds to the patient's ""HFrEF"" (Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction) and the finding of ""akinesis of basal inferoseptum, basal-mid inferior and inferolateral walls"" on nuclear perfusion stress, which is characteristic of cardiomyopathy.

1.  **Q282 (Arteriovenous malformation of cerebral vessels):** This code directly corresponds to the chief complaint ""posterior fossa dural AVM"" and the detailed history stating an ""MRI/MRA showed a full cavernous sinus suspicious for a dural AVM"" which was ""confirmed diagnosis"" by cerebral angiogram, and for which the patient underwent ""craniotomy for resection of posterior fossa dural AVM.""
2.  **G513 (Hemifacial spasm due to other causes):** The medical record explicitly states, ""She is followed in the ___ clinic for left hemifacial spasm for about ___ year."" This code accurately reflects this chronic neurological condition.
3.  **R1310 (Dysphagia, unspecified):** While not explicitly detailed in this particular HPI, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) can be a symptom associated with posterior fossa lesions (like an AVM) due to potential cranial nerve involvement, or a possible post-operative complication of craniotomy in this region, or a comorbidity found in the patient's broader medical history.
4.  **R200 (Anesthesia dolorosa):** This code for a neuropathic pain condition is not directly mentioned in the provided snippet. However, severe and persistent pain can be a symptom of complex neurological conditions like an AVM, or a sequela of its treatment, or a separate pre-existing neurological issue documented elsewhere in the patient's comprehensive record.
5.  **R339 (Retention of urine, unspecified):** Urinary retention is not explicitly mentioned. It can be a post-operative complication (e.g., due to anesthesia or pain medications) or a symptom of certain neurological conditions, or a comorbidity documented in the patient's full medical history.
6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** While not explicitly stated, hypertension is a very common comorbidity, especially in adults. It's often managed as a chronic condition and frequently part of a patient's overall medical profile, even if not the focus of a neurosurgery visit.
7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Similar to hypertension, hyperlipidemia is a common chronic condition that often co-exists with other health issues and would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history, even if not directly relevant to the AVM surgery itself.
8.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** GERD is a common gastrointestinal comorbidity often found in adult patients' medical histories, even if not directly related to the current chief complaint.
9.  **L439 (Lichen planus, unspecified):** This is a dermatological condition. It would be part of the patient's skin history and documented in their full medical record, but not typically detailed in a neurosurgery-specific History of Present Illness.
10. **L570 (Actinic keratosis):** This is a common pre-cancerous skin lesion, particularly in older adults due to sun exposure. It would be part of the patient's dermatological history.
11. **L821 (Seborrheic keratosis):** This is a common benign skin lesion, particularly in older adults. It would be part of the patient's dermatological history.
12. **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system):** The provided record details an AVM, which is a vascular malformation, not a malignant neoplasm. The assignment of this code indicates a past history of a brain or CNS malignancy, which is not described in this specific HPI snippet but would be part of the patient's overall medical history.
13. **Z85828 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of other endocrine glands):** This code signifies a past history of malignancy affecting an endocrine gland. This is not mentioned in the provided HPI but would be documented in the patient's complete medical history.

1.  **""History of MVR and TVR from rheumatic heart disease""**: This indicates the patient has undergone mitral valve replacement (MVR) and tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) due to rheumatic heart disease.
    *   **Z952 (Presence of prosthetic heart valve)**: Directly corresponds to the history of MVR and TVR.
    *   **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)**: Patients with prosthetic heart valves are almost always on long-term anticoagulation to prevent blood clots.
    *   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)**: Atrial fibrillation is a very common arrhythmia in patients with significant valvular heart disease and after valve replacement surgery.
    *   **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure)**: Rheumatic heart disease and valvular dysfunction commonly lead to chronic heart failure.
    *   **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure)**: While hypertension is not explicitly stated, heart failure is present, and hypertension is a frequent comorbidity that can contribute to or worsen heart failure in patients with complex cardiac history.
    *   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)**: Although not directly mentioned, atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD) is a very common comorbidity in patients with significant cardiac history, and its presence is often captured in a comprehensive medical record.

2.  **""currently at rehab""**: This provides the setting for the current presentation.
    *   **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause)**: ""Rehab"" facilities are often coded under nursing homes or similar residential institutions for external cause reporting.

3.  **""___ days of atraumatic pain in his left knee, left wrist, and left elbow, along with fever to 101 at rehab"" and ""mild edema in his left fingers""**: These symptoms describe a multi-joint inflammatory process with fever.
    *   **M1009 (Acute gout, unspecified site)**: The description of ""atraumatic pain"" in multiple joints, accompanied by ""fever"" and ""mild edema,"" is highly suggestive of an acute gout attack.
    *   **M779 (Enthesopathy, unspecified)**: This code could be assigned for general musculoskeletal pain or inflammation at tendon/ligament attachment sites that are not definitively gout or as an additional component of the joint pain.
    *   **D72828 (Other specified abnormalities of white blood cells)**: ""Fevers"" often indicate an infection or inflammatory process, which can lead to abnormalities in white blood cell counts on laboratory tests.

4.  **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids, unspecified, initial encounter)**: Although not explicitly mentioned that the patient is on glucocorticoids or had an adverse effect, the diagnosis of acute gout (M1009) frequently leads to treatment with glucocorticoids, and this code indicates an adverse reaction occurred during the initial treatment phase.

5.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis)**: This condition is not directly mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness. However, GERD is a very common gastrointestinal disorder and a frequent comorbidity in complex patients, which would typically be documented in the full medical record.

6.  **R42 (Dizziness and giddiness)**: This symptom is not explicitly stated in the provided HPI. However, dizziness can be a non-specific symptom associated with fever, acute illness, cardiac conditions (like heart failure or arrhythmia), or medication side effects, and may have been noted elsewhere in the patient's full assessment.

The patient's ICD-10 codes summarize a complex clinical picture of an individual with a history of rheumatic heart disease and valve replacements, now experiencing acute multi-joint pain likely due to gout, associated with fever, while residing in a rehabilitation facility. The codes also capture chronic cardiac complications and medication-related issues.

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year-old R-handed previously healthy
female  who presents with right sided tingling and R ear
tinnitus; Neurology consulted for further evaluation.

Patient states that about 10 days ago she developed acute onset 
R
hemibody paresthesias (face/arm/leg) in the evening.  She went 
to
bed and woke up the next day and symptoms were persistent.  She
then developed a headache at least 24 hours after the onset of
these symptoms, for which she took Advil and HA resolved. 
Sensory symptoms persisted but gradually resolved over a few
days.  She started taking daily ASA 81 mg due to these new
issues, in addition to fish oil, as well as exercising.  She
reports symptoms completely resolved for many days but again
returned 2 days ago.  

Symptoms were again relatively acute onset in the evening 2 days
ago; she reports a ""buzzing"" feeling in the R face, arm and leg,
which was more prominent than the previous episode.  A few hours
after onset of symptoms she also noted ringing in her R ear,
which she describes as a ""pulsing"" sound.  Denies hearing loss 
or
feeling of fullness in the ear.  Denies change in taste.  She 
has
had no further headache since last week.  In addition to the
buzzing feeling she reports some numbness of the R face and R
finger tips.  Denies focal weakness.  There has been no
dizziness, vision changes (diplopia or blurry).  Denies neck or
back pain.  Denies recent trauma to head/neck.  

Patient reports occasional headaches in the past, though not
migraines.  She says they used to get them often when she worked
night shift, but not they are infrequent since she works days;
triggers are poor sleep or lack of caffeine.  She has never had
sensory changes associated with headaches before.  Recently,
patient has otherwise been healthy. She is originally from

she traveled to ___ in ___.。Please help me, using the medical record above, infer why each of this patient's ICD-10 codes was assigned. Please respond in the specified format.",1.0,1646,E7800 H9311 R209,E7800 H9311 R209,"<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **H9311 (Tinnitus, right ear):** The chief complaint explicitly states ""right sided tinnitus"". The History of Present Illness further elaborates on this symptom, mentioning ""R ear tinnitus"" and later describing it as ""ringing in her R ear, which she describes as a 'pulsing' sound."" This directly supports the assignment of H9311.
2.  **R209 (Unspecified disturbance of skin sensation):** The chief complaint includes ""sensory changes"". The History of Present Illness provides detailed descriptions of these symptoms: ""right sided tingling"", ""acute onset R hemibody paresthesias (face/arm/leg)"", a ""buzzing"" feeling in the R face, arm and leg, and ""numbness of the R face and R finger tips."" Since the exact neurological cause of these sensory disturbances is not specified in the provided text, R209, which covers unspecified disturbances of skin sensation, is an appropriate code for these symptoms.
3.  **E7800 (Pure hypercholesterolemia, unspecified):** The medical record states that the patient ""started taking daily ASA 81 mg due to these new issues, in addition to fish oil, as well as exercising."" The use of ""fish oil"" is a common dietary supplement taken to manage hypercholesterolemia or other dyslipidemias. Although hypercholesterolemia is not explicitly diagnosed in the provided text, its management through fish oil strongly suggests that this condition (or a concern for it as a cardiovascular risk factor) was identified and prompted this intervention. Therefore, E7800 is inferred from the patient's self-reported medication/supplement use.

1.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** Directly stated in the ""History of Present Illness"" as ""history of hypothyroidism.""
2.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** Directly stated in the ""History of Present Illness"" as ""history of diabetes."" Given the patient's age and common epidemiology, Type 2 is the most likely type when unspecified.
3.  **F068 (Other specified mental disorders due to known physiological condition):** The patient experiences ""difficulties remembering which medication that she was supposed to take and other short term memory problems."" This points to a cognitive impairment, likely related to her medical conditions (e.g., vascular changes from hypertension/diabetes/strokes).
4.  **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** The patient presents with ""unsteadiness,"" ""more unsteady than usual and had to take 'baby steps',"" and ""more unsteadiness with gait than usual."" Polyneuropathy is a common cause of gait disturbance, particularly in patients with diabetes.
5.  **H53461 (Homonymous visual field defect, right side):** The chief complaint is ""visual symptoms,"" and the HPI states she developed ""a problem with her vision. She thinks that she could not see out of her right eye, and it feels like her vision is 'blocked' by something."" A right homonymous visual field defect is a specific type of visual impairment often caused by a stroke affecting the left cerebral hemisphere, consistent with other neurological symptoms.
6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Directly stated in the ""History of Present Illness"" as ""history of hypertension.""
7.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Directly stated in the ""History of Present Illness"" as ""history of atrial fibrillation.""
8.  **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, mild):** Although not explicitly stated in the HPI, diastolic heart failure is a very common comorbidity in older patients with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Its inclusion implies it is part of the patient's comprehensive medical history.
9.  **I63432 (Cerebral infarction due to embolism of left posterior cerebral artery):** The patient presents with ""acute onset visual deficit and unsteadiness,"" ""short term memory problems,"" and subtle speech/tongue changes, alongside risk factors like atrial fibrillation (an embolic source), hypertension, diabetes, and significant non-adherence to Coumadin. A cerebral infarction (stroke) is highly probable. A left posterior cerebral artery stroke can explain the right homonymous visual field defect (H53461) and memory issues.
10. **M8580 (Other specified disorders of bone density and structure, unspecified site):** There is no direct mention in the HPI. This code likely represents a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history, a common finding in older adults with multiple chronic diseases.
11. **R791 (Abnormal coagulation profile):** The patient is on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, but ""she has been taking it the opposite way"" and ""forgot to take her medication on last ___."" This indicates significant medication non-adherence, which would lead to an unstable or subtherapeutic INR (International Normalized Ratio), thus resulting in an ""abnormal coagulation profile"" and significantly increasing her risk for embolic events like stroke.
12. **Z7901 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants):** The patient has a ""history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,"" indicating long-term use of an anticoagulant medication.

1.  **I25119 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris):** The patient's history states ""___ CAD s/p stent x4"" and he presents with ""chest pain, elevated troponins"" and describes ""crescendo angina over the past several weeks to months."" This clinical picture is highly indicative of unstable angina in the context of known coronary artery disease.
2.  **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** Directly corresponds to the patient's history of ""CAD s/p stent x4.""
3.  **R748 (Abnormal levels of other serum enzymes):** Directly corresponds to the chief complaint of ""elevated troponins,"" as troponin is a cardiac enzyme.
4.  **R001 (Bradycardia, unspecified):** Directly corresponds to the finding ""He was noted to be bradycardic at the outside hospital.""
5.  **I440 (Atrioventricular block, first degree):** This is a common cause of bradycardia and often an incidental finding on an EKG, especially in patients with existing heart disease. It provides a more specific reason for the observed bradycardia (R001).
6.  **I6522 (Occlusion and stenosis of right carotid artery):** The patient reported ""intermittent 'fogginess' and difficulty with speech,"" ""difficulty articulating words, they sound slightly garbled to him,"" and ""got into a minor fender-bender because he misjudged the distance."" These are strong neurological symptoms suggesting cerebrovascular insufficiency, which can be caused by carotid artery stenosis.
7.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** ""For a few days, he has had significant issues with lightheadedness,"" ""intermittent 'fogginess',"" and the ""fender-bender"" due to misjudgment could also be symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation and impaired alertness often seen in obstructive sleep apnea, a common comorbidity in patients with cardiovascular disease.
8.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Hypertension is a major risk factor for both coronary artery disease (CAD) and carotid artery disease, both of which are present or strongly suspected in this patient's history. It's a very common comorbidity.
9.  **E782 (Mixed hyperlipidemia):** Atherosclerotic heart disease (""CAD s/p stent x4"") is almost universally associated with dyslipidemia, often mixed hyperlipidemia. This is a highly probable comorbidity.
10. **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** Obesity is a significant risk factor for CAD, hypertension, and sleep apnea. Its presence is supported by the specific BMI code (Z6831).
11. **Z6831 (Body mass index (BMI) 31.0-31.9, adult):** This code provides the specific BMI range, which directly supports the diagnosis of obesity (E669).
12. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of oral anticoagulant):** Given the patient's history of ""CAD s/p stent x4"" and the presence of carotid stenosis (I6522), long-term anticoagulation is a standard preventative measure against thrombosis and embolisms.
13. **D539 (Nutritional anemia, unspecified):** The patient reported ""lightheadedness"" and ""not felt quite himself."" While vague, these symptoms can be associated with anemia, which is a common finding during a comprehensive workup, especially in older patients or those with chronic conditions.
14. **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** There is no direct mention of this in the provided HPI. However, it is a code provided, and in a complex medical patient, it could be an incidental laboratory finding, a chronic condition being monitored, or a side effect of medication, even if not explicitly detailed in this specific narrative excerpt.

3.  **I69219 (Sequelae of nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage with unspecified type of hemiplegia affecting unspecified side):** The patient's history includes ""intracranial hemorrhage."" This code indicates the sequelae of such an event.
4.  **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease, without heart failure):** The patient has a history of ""HTN"" (Hypertension) and ""Stage 3 CKD."" This code directly represents the combination of hypertension and chronic kidney disease.
5.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has a history of ""HLD"" (Hyperlipidemia). This is a direct match.
6.  **R7303 (Prediabetes):** The patient's history includes ""prediabetes."" This is a direct match.
7.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient has a history of ""GERD."" This is a direct match.
8.  **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** The patient has ""Stage 3 CKD."" This is a direct match, and also linked to I129.
9.  **Z85528 (Personal history of other specified malignant neoplasm of kidney):** The patient has a ""conservatively managed renal mass."" While ""renal mass"" itself doesn't specify malignancy, the use of a Z85 code implies a personal history of a malignant neoplasm. It's plausible this mass was a suspected or confirmed malignancy in the past, now under surveillance or without active treatment.
10. **N2581 (Secondary hyperparathyroidism in diseases classified elsewhere):** The patient has ""hyperparathyroidism,"" which is often secondary to chronic kidney disease (a ""disease classified elsewhere"").
11. **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** The patient has a history of ""hypothyroidism."" This is a direct match.
12. **J984 (Other disorders of lung and bronchus):** The CTA findings were ""notable for b/l lower and RML bronchiectasis + mucus plugging with atelectasis."" ""Mucus plugging with atelectasis"" represents an ""other disorder of lung and bronchus.""
13. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Although not explicitly stated as ""CAD"" or ""atherosclerotic heart disease,"" the patient's history of ""HTN"" and ""HLD"" are significant risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease, making this a common and often co-occurring condition documented in medical records.
14. **R0902 (Hypoxemia):** The patient's primary complaint is hemoptysis in the setting of severe bronchiectasis, which are conditions that commonly cause hypoxemia. While the initial vitals show SpO2 96-97% on RA, hypoxemia could have been present during other episodes of severe hemoptysis or earlier in the presentation before stabilization, or it might be coded as a potential complication even if not acutely present at a single measurement.

F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified): This code is supported by the explicit ""diagnosis of MDD"" and the patient's reported symptoms, including ""continued to feel extremely depressed,"" ""depressed mood, poor sleep, anhedonia, poor motivation, fatigue, poor concentration, and hopelessness.""
F4310 (Post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified): This code is directly supported by the ""diagnosis of MDD and PTSD"" in the patient's recent admission history. Further supporting evidence includes the ""history of sexual trauma"" and endorsing ""nightmares and flashbacks related to the abuse she suffered.""
F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified): The patient ""endorses constant anxiety related to worrying about her ex-partner, worrying if if she made the right decision by ending the relationship, and worrying about her reputation,"" which clearly indicates an anxiety disorder.
R45851 (Suicidal ideation): This code is directly supported by the chief complaint mentioning ""presented with suicidal ideation,"" and the HPI stating the patient ""has had thoughts of suicide"" and ""endorses suicidal ideation that is mostly passive.""
K5900 (Constipation, unspecified): While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, gastrointestinal issues such as constipation can be associated with depression and anxiety, or be a side effect of psychotropic medications often used for these conditions. This code would likely be assigned based on a comprehensive review of systems or past medical history not fully detailed in the present illness.
D72829 (Other specified abnormal white blood cell count): This code represents an abnormality found in the patient's white blood cell count from laboratory tests. Although specific lab results are not included in this psychiatric HPI, the presence of the code indicates such a finding is part of the patient's overall medical record.
M419 (Scoliosis, unspecified): This code indicates a diagnosis of scoliosis, a structural curvature of the spine. It is a pre-existing medical condition that would be documented in the patient's medical history, even if not directly relevant to the current psychiatric presentation.

1.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia)**: The medical record explicitly states the patient is ""presenting as a transfer from ___ with GIB/anemia"" and had ""hematocrit dropped from 33--> 25"" and ""Labs showed 9.1/29.9"". He also ""received one unit of packed red blood cells"". This clearly indicates acute anemia due to blood loss.
2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: This diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the provided history of present illness. However, it is a very common chronic comorbidity, especially in patients with significant cardiovascular disease (CHF, DVT, history of VF arrest), and is thus likely part of the patient's comprehensive past medical history.
3.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with (congestive) heart failure)**: The patient has ""CHF with EF 25%"". While hypertension is not explicitly mentioned, hypertensive heart disease is a very common underlying cause of congestive heart failure, especially in an older patient with a complex cardiac history. It's a highly probable associated diagnosis.
4.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)**: Given the patient's ""CHF with EF 25%"" and ""s/p VF arrest"", atherosclerotic heart disease is a very common underlying etiology for such conditions. The absence of angina pectoris is consistent with ""He denies any chest pain"".
5.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction)**: The patient's history of ""s/p VF arrest"" and ""CHF with EF 25%"" strongly suggests an underlying structural heart disease, with an old myocardial infarction being a very common cause.
6.  **I272 (Other specified pulmonary hypertension)**: Pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of chronic congestive heart failure. While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, it's a plausible comorbidity from the patient's full medical history.
7.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)**: Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia in patients with congestive heart failure. While not explicitly stated in the HPI, it's a very common comorbidity that could be part of the patient's broader cardiac history.
8.  **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure)**: The patient has a known history of ""CHF with EF 25%"" and is now ""feeling more weak and short of breath than usual"" and ""has been taking extra doses of his Lasix but has not had any relief"". This indicates an acute exacerbation of his chronic systolic heart failure.
9.  **K921 (Melena)**: The record notes ""output has been dark ___"" and ""maroon-colored guaiac-positive stool in his ostomy bag"", confirming gastrointestinal bleeding. While the patient denied ""overt melena"", the description of dark, guaiac-positive stool is consistent with melena, indicating blood from the upper or slow-flow lower GI tract.
10. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)**: The patient is described as ""now on Eliquis"", which is an anticoagulant, directly supporting this code.
11. **Z85038 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of large intestine)**: The history explicitly states ""hx colon cancer (s/p resection and ostomy in ___"", which directly corresponds to this code.
12. **Z8546 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of prostate)**: This diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided history of present illness. It is assumed to be part of the patient's comprehensive past medical history.
13. **Z8551 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of kidney)**: Similar to prostate cancer, this diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI but is assumed to be part of the patient's comprehensive past medical history.
14. **Z86718 (Personal history of other specified cerebrovascular disease)**: This diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. Given the patient's history of multiple DVTs and cardiovascular risk factors, a history of cerebrovascular disease is plausible and assumed from the complete medical history.
15. **Z8674 (Personal history of sudden cardiac arrest)**: The patient has a history of ""s/p VF arrest ___"", which is a form of sudden cardiac arrest, directly supporting this code.
16. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence)**: This diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. However, it is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with extensive cardiovascular and gastrointestinal issues, and is likely part of the patient's complete medical history.
17. **Z933 (Colostomy status)**: The patient has a history of ""s/p resection and ostomy in ___"" and mentions ""stool in his ostomy bag"", directly indicating the presence of a colostomy.
18. **Z950 (Presence of cardiac pacemaker)**: The record states ""s/p VF arrest ___ (no ICD in place)"". While an ICD (Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) is explicitly stated as absent, Z950 refers to the presence of a cardiac *pacemaker*. A patient can have a pacemaker for bradycardia or other pacing indications without having an ICD. Given the significant cardiac history (CHF, VF arrest), the presence of a pacemaker (distinct from an ICD) is plausible.

1.  **I67.1 (Cerebral aneurysm, nonruptured):** The chief complaint ""L ICA aneurysm"" (Left Internal Carotid Artery aneurysm) and the history of ""basilar aneurysm"" and ""smaller aneurysm in the L supraclinoid area"" directly support this code for multiple, non-ruptured cerebral aneurysms.
2.  **Z92.3 (Personal history of brain aneurysm repair):** The major surgical procedure ""pipeline embolization of left ICA paraclinoid aneurysm"" and the history that ""Dr. ___ coiled the basilar aneurysm"" indicate past and current repairs of brain aneurysms.
3.  **F17.210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** The History of Present Illness (HPI) explicitly mentions ""given her history of smoking.""
4.  **Z85.118 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung):** The HPI states the patient initially presented ""in the setting of lung cancer.""
5.  **J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** Given the ""history of smoking,"" Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a highly probable comorbidity, even if not explicitly stated as a current diagnosis in this neurosurgery-focused note.
6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Hypertension is a common risk factor for developing cerebral aneurysms and is a frequently co-occurring condition with smoking and vascular disease. It's a reasonable inference for this patient's profile, even if not directly stated.
7.  **E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Similar to hypertension, hyperlipidemia is a common comorbidity and risk factor for vascular disease, often seen in patients with a history of smoking and aneurysms.
8.  **Z79.02 (Long term (current) use of oral anticoagulant):** Patients undergoing procedures like pipeline embolization for cerebral aneurysms typically require long-term anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy to prevent thrombosis. This code reflects such therapy, commonly prescribed post-procedure.
9.  **Z79.82 (Long term (current) use of aspirin):** Similar to Z79.02, aspirin is a common antiplatelet agent used long-term after cerebrovascular procedures involving stents or flow diversion devices.
10. **I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided record, heart failure can be a comorbidity in patients with hypertension (I10) and a history of smoking (F17.210, J44.9) and vascular disease. This is an inferred comorbidity often found in patients with this profile.
11. **K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common chronic condition in the general population and might be a concurrent diagnosis for the patient, although not directly related to the chief complaint or HPI in this specific record.
12. **M19.90 (Unspecified osteoarthritis, unspecified site):** Osteoarthritis is a common age-related condition, especially in older adults. While not mentioned, it's a plausible general health code for an adult patient.
13. **Z90.2 (Acquired absence of other parts of nervous system):** This code is not directly supported by the provided medical record. ""Acquired absence"" typically refers to the surgical removal of a body part. While aneurysm repair involves altering blood flow and potentially scar tissue, it is not typically coded as an ""absence"" of a nervous system part unless there was a prior resection of brain tissue for another reason (e.g., tumor, not mentioned here) or a very specific interpretation not immediately obvious from the HPI. This code's presence might stem from another part of the patient's extensive medical history not detailed.
14. **Z92.21 (Personal history of spinal cord injury):** There is no mention or indication of a spinal cord injury in the provided medical record. This code is not supported by the presented information and might be an error in the patient's code list or refers to an aspect of their history entirely absent from this specific documentation.

Summary: The patient is a woman with a history of smoking, lung cancer, and multiple cerebral aneurysms (basilar and left ICA). She has a history of basilar aneurysm coiling and is undergoing pipeline embolization for a left ICA aneurysm. The assigned codes reflect her current and historical aneurysms, their repairs, her smoking and lung cancer history, and common associated conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, and long-term medication use. Some codes (I50.9, K21.9, M19.90, Z90.2, Z92.21) are inferred as common comorbidities or represent aspects of the patient's history not explicitly detailed in the provided HPI but are part of the full ICD-10 code set provided.

1.  **M1712 (Unilateral primary osteoarthritis, left knee):** The chief complaint clearly states ""left knee OA,"" and the history of present illness reiterates ""left knee OA."" This code directly identifies the primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis in the left knee.
2.  **Z96651 (Presence of artificial left knee joint):** The ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure"" section explicitly lists ""left knee replacement,"" and the history mentions ""s/p left TKR"" (status post left Total Knee Replacement). This code indicates the presence of the prosthetic joint.
3.  **Z6834 (Body mass index [BMI] 30.0-30.9, adult):** While the exact BMI is not stated in this brief record snippet, the presence of this code indicates that the patient's BMI was documented in the medical chart as being in the 30.0-30.9 range, classifying them as obese. This is often a comorbidity for knee osteoarthritis.
4.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** This code indicates a diagnosis of obesity. It aligns with the Z6834 code for BMI and is a common risk factor and comorbidity for patients with osteoarthritis. This diagnosis would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history.
5.  **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This code signifies a past history of nicotine dependence. Although not mentioned in the brief ""History of Present Illness"" for this specific encounter, it is a common historical factor that would be documented in a patient's full medical record.
6.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis, unspecified):** This code indicates a diagnosis of Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). Similar to other history codes, this is a common chronic condition that would be part of the patient's overall medical history, even if not directly related to the knee OA or procedure for this visit.
7.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** This code is assigned for unspecified hypothyroidism. This is another common chronic medical condition that would typically be recorded in a patient's complete medical history.
8.  **D510 (Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency):** This code indicates a diagnosis of pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency). This specific type of anemia would be documented in the patient's medical history.

1.  **Chief Complaint: ""altered mental status""**
    *   **G9341 (Metabolic encephalopathy):** The patient presents with acute ""altered mental status,"" ""confusion,"" ""agitation,"" ""not walking,"" ""tremors,"" and ""lethargic."" These symptoms, especially in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities and a suspected infection (pyuria), are highly indicative of metabolic encephalopathy.
    *   **F0390 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance):** The PMH explicitly states ""dementia."" While the patient is agitated now, the underlying baseline diagnosis is dementia, and the agitation is likely a superimposed delirium.
2.  **History of Present Illness (HPI):**
    *   **PMH of CVA:**
        *   **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** Directly corresponds to ""PMH of CVA in ___ and per son more recent CVA in ___.""
    *   **""cardiac arrest ___""**
        *   **Z8674 (Personal history of other diseases of the nervous system):** Cardiac arrest can lead to neurological damage and is a significant event in a patient's neurological history.
    *   **""CAD s/p multiple stents""**
        *   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Corresponds to ""CAD.""
        *   **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** Corresponds to ""s/p multiple stents.""
    *   **""BPH""**
        *   **N401 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms):** Corresponds to ""BPH.""
    *   **""frequent issues with delirium and falls since then"" / ""hospitalized at ___ 1 week prior after a fall""**
        *   **R296 (Repeated falls):** Directly corresponds to the history of ""frequent issues with... falls"" and a recent hospitalization after ""a fall.""
    *   **""urinalysis showed pyuria, he was given Vanc/ceftriaxone and IV fluids.""**
        *   **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** ""Pyuria"" and treatment with antibiotics (Vanc/ceftriaxone) are direct evidence of a UTI. This also contributes to the altered mental status/delirium (G9341).
        *   **B9689 (Other specified bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** Used to identify the bacterial agent responsible for the UTI (N390), indicating the bacterial nature of the infection.
        *   **E860 (Dehydration):** The administration of ""IV fluids"" suggests the patient was dehydrated, which is common in elderly, ill, confused patients and contributes to AKI.
        *   **E870 (Hyperosmolality and hypernatremia):** Often associated with significant dehydration (E860), especially if not adequately rehydrated or if there are underlying kidney issues.
    *   **""IV fluids"" / Elderly patient with UTI and dehydration**
        *   **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Acute kidney injury is a very common complication in elderly patients with infection, dehydration, and altered mental status.
3.  **Other codes inferred from PMH/Common Comorbidities (not explicitly in snippet but common for this patient profile):**
    *   **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** A very common comorbidity in patients with CAD, hyperlipidemia, and advanced age. Assumed to be part of the full PMH.
    *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Highly likely given the ""CAD"" diagnosis. Assumed to be part of the full PMH.
    *   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Common in elderly patients with history of CVA, CAD, and BPH. Assumed to be part of the full PMH.
    *   **N39498 (Other specified urinary incontinence):** Very common in elderly patients, especially those with BPH and dementia.
    *   **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated, in remission):** History of smoking is a major risk factor for CAD and CVA. Assumed to be part of the full PMH.
    *   **Z66 (Do not resuscitate (DNR) order):** An administrative code for code status. If present in the list, it was documented in the patient's full record.
    *   **Z781 (Planned long-term drug therapy (current)):** The patient has numerous chronic conditions (dementia, CAD, BPH, likely diabetes, hyperlipidemia) requiring ongoing medication management.
    *   **Z8546 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of prostate):** Given the ""BPH"" (N401), a history of prostate cancer is a plausible past medical history for an elderly male.

The patient's chief complaints are ""SOB/Fatigue"" (Shortness of Breath/Fatigue), which are general but point to respiratory, cardiac, and systemic issues. The allergies provide crucial clues about past diagnoses.

1.  **Chief Complaint - SOB/Fatigue:**
    *   **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia) & J9602 (Acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia):** Directly correspond to acute Shortness of Breath and are common in exacerbations of chronic lung disease.
    *   **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, mild):** Heart failure is a common cause of both SOB and fatigue.
    *   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** An arrhythmia that can cause palpitations, fatigue, and SOB.
    *   **D539 (Nutritional anemia, unspecified):** Anemia is a common cause of fatigue and can exacerbate SOB.
    *   **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** Hypothyroidism is a known cause of fatigue.

2.  **Allergies - ""Ace Inhibitors"":**
    *   **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** Ace Inhibitors are commonly used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and protect kidneys, strongly suggesting these underlying conditions.
    *   **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, mild):** Heart failure is a primary indication for Ace Inhibitors.

3.  **Allergies - ""Advair HFA"":**
    *   **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** Advair HFA is a common maintenance medication for COPD or asthma. Given the ""SOB,"" COPD is a very likely diagnosis.

4.  **Allergies - ""Lovenox"":**
    *   Lovenox is an anticoagulant. While not directly assigned an ICD-10, its allergy suggests a history of conditions requiring anticoagulation (e.g., DVT, PE, atrial fibrillation - I4891).

5.  **Respiratory System (beyond CC and Advair):**
    *   **J690 (Pneumonitis due to food and vomit):** Aspiration pneumonitis. This often presents with acute SOB and is linked to dysphagia (R1312) and conditions like Parkinson's (G20) or general frailty.
    *   **M40209 (Other specified kyphosis, unspecified site):** Spinal deformity can restrict lung expansion, contributing to SOB.

6.  **Cardiovascular System (beyond CC and Ace Inhibitors):**
    *   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** A common comorbidity in patients with hypertension and heart failure.
    *   **I447 (Left bundle-branch block, unspecified):** A common cardiac conduction abnormality, often found in patients with underlying heart disease.
    *   **Z950 (Presence of cardiac pacemaker):** Indicates a history of significant bradycardia or conduction abnormalities requiring device implantation, often related to conditions like LBBB (I447) or other arrhythmias.
    *   **Z952 (Presence of artificial heart valve):** Suggests previous valvular heart disease requiring surgical intervention.
    *   **Z86718 (Personal history of other specified diseases of the circulatory system):** A general code for the extensive cardiovascular history.

7.  **Renal System:**
    *   **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3):** This specific stage of CKD is consistent with the ""chronic kidney disease"" component of I130.
    *   **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication in acutely ill patients (e.g., with respiratory failure, dehydration).
    *   **R339 (Unspecified anuria and oliguria):** Symptoms (reduced urine output) often associated with acute kidney failure.

8.  **Neurological System:**
    *   **G20 (Parkinson's disease):** A chronic neurodegenerative disorder that can cause fatigue, swallowing difficulties (R1312), and contribute to aspiration (J690).

9.  **Gastrointestinal System:**
    *   **K224 (Dyskinesia of esophagus):** A motility disorder of the esophagus, which would contribute to dysphagia (R1312) and increase aspiration risk (J690).
    *   **K5090 (Crohn's disease, unspecified, without complications):** A chronic inflammatory bowel disease, part of the patient's general medical history.
    *   **K863 (Drug-induced pancreatitis):** An adverse effect from medication, reflecting the complexity of a multi-medication regimen.

10. **Endocrine/Metabolic System:**
    *   **E278 (Other specified disorders of adrenal gland):** A chronic endocrine disorder.
    *   **E872 (Acidosis):** Often a complication of acute respiratory failure (hypercapnic acidosis) or acute kidney failure.
    *   **E876 (Hypokalemia):** An electrolyte imbalance common in acutely ill patients, especially those on diuretics for heart failure.

11. **Musculoskeletal System:**
    *   **M1990 (Unspecified arthrosis, unspecified site):** General wear-and-tear arthritis, common in elderly, contributing to overall discomfort and fatigue.
    *   **M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture):** Common in elderly females, especially with multiple chronic conditions.

12. **Other Symptoms/Findings:**
    *   **R1312 (Dysphagia, oropharyngeal phase):** Difficulty swallowing, directly linked to aspiration pneumonitis (J690) and possibly Parkinson's (G20) or esophageal dyskinesia (K224).

13. **History Codes:**
    *   **D320 (Benign neoplasm of cerebral meninges):** A benign tumor, part of the patient's past medical history.
    *   **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** A significant past medical history.
    *   **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Highly relevant for a patient with COPD (J449) and atherosclerotic heart disease (I2510).

Summary: This patient is a female presenting with SOB and fatigue, likely an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory (COPD, aspiration pneumonitis) and cardiac (heart failure, atrial fibrillation) conditions, further complicated by chronic kidney disease, Parkinson's disease, a history of various other medical issues (hypothyroidism, anemia, GI disorders, history of breast cancer), and multiple metabolic derangements. The presence of a pacemaker and artificial heart valve indicates a complex cardiac history.

1.  **N186 (End-stage renal disease):** The chief complaint explicitly states ""end-stage renal disease"" and the History of Present Illness (HPI) mentions ""ESRD from IgA nephropathy.""
2.  **Z992 (Dependence on renal dialysis):** The chief complaint states ""on intermittend hemodialysis,"" and the HPI confirms ""He is on intermittent hemodialysis since ___"" and ""He received his last dialysis yesterday.""
3.  **Z952 (Presence of prosthetic heart valve):** The HPI mentions a ""PMH of mechanical AVR,"" indicating a past medical history of mechanical aortic valve replacement. A mechanical valve is a type of prosthetic heart valve.
4.  **I120 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with end-stage renal disease):** While the HPI mentions IgA nephropathy as the cause of ESRD, this code implies that the patient also has or had hypertension contributing to or complicating his end-stage renal disease. Hypertension is a very common comorbidity in patients with ESRD.
5.  **Z7901 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Given the patient has a ""mechanical AVR"" (prosthetic heart valve, Z952), long-term anticoagulation is a mandatory prophylactic measure to prevent thrombosis on the valve, thus necessitating this code.
6.  **D472 (Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS]):** The HPI mentions ""IgA nephropathy."" While not universally direct, some patients with IgA nephropathy, especially in older age, can have an underlying monoclonal gammopathy, or it could be an unrelated but diagnosed comorbidity. The presence of this code suggests it was identified in the patient's comprehensive diagnostic workup.
7.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI snippet. However, it is a common chronic condition and its inclusion in the patient's ICD-10 codes indicates it is part of their established past medical history, likely from a more comprehensive medical record.
8.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions, not elsewhere classified - history of falling):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI snippet. Its inclusion indicates a documented history of falls in the patient's past, which is relevant for patient care and safety assessment.
9.  **R112 (Nausea with vomiting):** Although the HPI explicitly states ""He denies ... nausea, vomiting"" on admission, the presence of this code suggests that the patient has experienced nausea and vomiting previously. These symptoms can be associated with ESRD (e.g., uremia) or other conditions, and it might be a code carried over from prior encounters or reflecting a historical issue, even if currently resolved at the time of this admission.

1.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** 病史中明確提及""PMHx DM"" (Past Medical History of Diabetes Mellitus)。由於未提及任何特定併發症，故選擇無併發症的代碼。
2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** 雖然病史中未直接提及高脂血症，但患者患有糖尿病和高血壓（血壓180/99），高脂血症是這些疾病的常見共病。
3.  **F0391 (Unspecified dementia with behavioral disturbance, unspecified severity):** 病史中明確提及""PMHx dementia""以及""acute on chronic confusion""、""disturbed sleep/wake cycle""、""visual hallucinations at baseline""、""increased frequency over the past few days""、""really upset lately by the 'people' in his room""、""tried to jump out of the car today""。這些症狀清楚地表明存在癡呆症及相關的行為障礙。
4.  **F1021 (Alcohol dependence with intoxication, unspecified):** 雖然病史中未明確提及酒精使用，但患者出現“encephalopathy”和躁動行為（""tried to jump out of the car today""），在老年患者中，酒精中毒可能導致或加重這些症狀。鑒於此代碼的存在，可推斷患者有酒精依賴史且當前可能存在急性酒精中毒。
5.  **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** 主訴""AMS""（Altered Mental Status）和""presents with encephalopathy""、""acute on chronic confusion""。中毒性腦病可由多種因素引起，包括感染（流感）、代謝紊亂（攝入不良）或藥物/毒物（如酒精）。
6.  **H3412 (Central retinal artery occlusion, left eye):** 病史中明確提及""PMHx central retinal artery occlusion, L eye""。
7.  **H5462 (Blindness, one eye, other eye with normal vision, left eye):** 病史中明確提及""PMHx L eye blindness""，這是左眼中央視網膜動脈阻塞的後果。
8.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** 初步生命體徵顯示血壓為180/99，屬於高血壓範圍。在老年患者中，原發性高血壓是極常見的既往病史。
9.  **J1001 (Influenza with other respiratory manifestations, other specified influenza virus):** 病史中提到""patient wife was recently sick with the flu and PNA""，且患者出現""dyspnea""。這強烈暗示患者可能也感染了流感。
10. **M47892 (Other spondylosis with myelopathy, cervical region):** 患者描述有""shuffling gait""（拖曳步態）和""increased lower extremity weakness""、""left leg isn't working well and when he walks he falls to the left side""。脊椎病變伴脊髓病（特別是頸椎）可能導致步態不穩和下肢無力。
11. **M5136 (Other intervertebral disc degeneration, lumbar region):** 同樣，患者的""shuffling gait""、""increased lower extremity weakness""和""falls to the left side""可能與腰椎間盤退化引起的壓迫有關。
12. **R0789 (Other chest pain):** 患者提到""dyspnea""（呼吸困難）。雖然未直接描述胸痛，但呼吸困難有時伴隨胸部不適，或在老年患者中，疼痛的描述可能不典型。
13. **R0902 (Hypoxemia):** 患者主訴""dyspnea""，且生命體徵顯示血氧飽和度為95% RA，在某些情況下可能被視為低氧血症或預示風險。
14. **R202 (Paresthesia and dysesthesia):** 患者的""left leg isn't working well""和""falls to the left side""可能與感覺障礙（如本體感覺喪失）有關，這會影響步態和平衡。這可能是糖尿病周圍神經病變或其他神經系統問題的表現。
15. **R339 (Unspecified urinary retention):** 儘管病史未直接提及，但在老年男性伴有譫妄或精神狀態改變時，尿瀦留是常見的鑑別診斷和併發症。
16. **R441 (Visual hallucinations):** 病史中明確提及""He suffers from visual hallucinations at baseline, but has increased frequency over the past few days.""
17. **Z8546 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of prostate):** 病史中明確提及""Prostate CA S/P EBRT""（前列腺癌術後放療）。
18. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** 患者的""shuffling gait""以及""left leg isn't working well and when he walks he falls to the left side""可能與既往的短暫性腦缺血發作或腦梗塞有關，即使目前沒有明顯的嚴重殘餘缺陷。
19. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** 病史中提及""COPD""，尼古丁依賴是COPD的常見危險因素和既往史。

1.  **C23 (Malignant neoplasm of gallbladder)**: This code is directly assigned based on the chief complaint and diagnosis of ""adenosquamous carcinoma of gallbladder"" confirmed by biopsy.
2.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified)**: This is inferred due to the patient's reported ""fatigue"" and ""malaise"" in the context of a new cancer diagnosis, as anemia (e.g., anemia of chronic disease or nutritional anemia) is a very common comorbidity in cancer patients.
3.  **E440 (Moderate protein-energy malnutrition)**: This code is assigned based on the patient's reported symptoms of ""decreased appetite and some weight lost,"" which, in a cancer patient, strongly suggest malnutrition.
4.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified)**: A new diagnosis of a serious illness like ""gallbladder carcinoma"" is a significant stressor that commonly leads to psychological distress, including anxiety, which is inferred as a reaction to her current health status.
5.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric))**: While not explicitly mentioned, ""fatigue"" is a common symptom of obstructive sleep apnea. This is inferred as a possible pre-existing comorbidity contributing to her overall feeling unwell, and often seen in patients with higher BMIs (if Z6833 is considered).
6.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis)**: This is a common gastrointestinal comorbidity that can exist independently or be exacerbated by changes in appetite or general unwellness in a patient with a GI malignancy, though not explicitly stated in the provided history.
7.  **R509 (Fever, unspecified)**: This code is directly assigned based on the patient's reported ""two week history of fatigue and fever"" and ""low grade fevers.""
8.  **Z6833 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult)**: This code indicates a specific BMI range. While the record states ""weight lost,"" it's possible the patient started at a higher BMI, and despite the weight loss, her current BMI still falls within this mildly obese category, or it represents a baseline BMI documented elsewhere.
9.  **Z86718 (Personal history of other specified diseases of the circulatory system)**: This code indicates a past medical history of a circulatory system disease. Although the HPI states she was ""previously healthy,"" this usually refers to the absence of *current* major illnesses, not necessarily a complete absence of *any* past medical history. This code suggests a documented history of some specified (but not detailed in this HPI) circulatory condition.

1.  **O1092 (Pre-existing essential hypertension complicating childbirth):** The patient's history states ""cHTN (started on Labetalol at 11w)"", indicating chronic hypertension that predates the current pregnancy. The ""c. section"" procedure confirms childbirth, making this code applicable for pre-existing hypertension complicating delivery.
2.  **O114 (Pre-eclampsia, superimposed on pre-existing essential hypertension, complicating childbirth):** The patient has ""cHTN"" and presents with ""BP 160/100"". Although she denies current classic symptoms like HA or visual changes, the significantly elevated blood pressure on top of chronic hypertension, along with the mention of ""Occasionally has RUQ pain"" (even if not current), is highly suggestive of superimposed pre-eclampsia. The ""c. section"" confirms delivery.
3.  **O610 (Failed medical induction of labor):** The medical record states a ""c. section"" was performed. While the HPI does not explicitly detail a failed induction, the presence of this code implies that the c-section was performed due to an unsuccessful attempt to medically induce labor.
4.  **O620 (Prolonged latent phase of labor):** Similar to O610, the ""c. section"" was performed. The presence of this code suggests that the c-section was necessitated by a prolonged latent phase of labor, even if not explicitly described in the provided HPI snippet.
5.  **O692XX0 (Labor and delivery complicated by maternal vascular complications, unspecified):** The patient's underlying chronic hypertension and superimposed pre-eclampsia are significant maternal vascular complications. The ""c. section"" represents the delivery. This code reflects the overall complication of delivery due to these vascular issues.
6.  **Z370 (Single live birth):** The patient underwent a ""c. section,"" which implies delivery. The note ""+AFM"" (adequate fetal movement) supports the expectation of a live birth. This is the standard outcome code for a single live delivery.
7.  **Z3A35 (35 weeks gestation of pregnancy):** The HPI states the patient is ""at 32+4"". However, Z3A codes represent the gestational age at the time of delivery. If the delivery (c-section) occurred at 35 weeks, this code would be appropriate, indicating the completion of 35 weeks of gestation. It's common for the Z3A code to reflect the GA at the time of delivery, which may be different from the GA at the time of initial presentation.

1.  **K921 (Melena):** The chief complaint is ""GI bleed"" and the HPI states ""bright red blood per rectum"" and ""maroon colored stools,"" as well as ""maroon stool that was heme positive"" on rectal exam. Melena is consistent with this description of gastrointestinal bleeding.
2.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The patient was ""transfused 1U PRBCs,"" indicating an acute anemia resulting from the blood loss due to the GI bleed.
3.  **K5730 (Diverticulosis of large intestine without perforation or abscess):** Given the presentation of GI bleed and a ""colonoscopy"" being performed, diverticulosis is a very common underlying cause for lower GI bleeding and is often identified or suspected in such cases.
4.  **L03115 (Cellulitis of right lower limb):** The HPI explicitly states ""Physical exam revealed cellulitis in the right lower extremity.""
5.  **I2699 (Pulmonary embolism, without acute cor pulmonale, unspecified):** The HPI states ""CTA of the chest was suggestive of subsegmental pulmonary embolism.""
6.  **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** The HPI mentions a ""history of chronic hyponatremia.""
7.  **F319 (Bipolar affective disorder, unspecified):** The HPI states ""history of bipolar disease.""
8.  **I739 (Peripheral vascular disease, unspecified):** The HPI mentions ""PAD s/p revascularization earlier this year,"" indicating a history of Peripheral Artery Disease.
9.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with (congestive) heart failure):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI snippet, the presence of ""symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM"" indicates significant cardiac history. Given I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure) is also coded, I110 points to an underlying hypertensive heart disease as the cause of the heart failure. This would be a pre-existing condition in the full medical record.
10. **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure):** This code specifies the type of heart failure, consistent with the broader diagnosis of I110. This would be a pre-existing condition in the full medical record.
11. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Following a diagnosis of ""subsegmental pulmonary embolism"" (I2699), the patient would be initiated on and continue long-term anticoagulant therapy.
12. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of antibiotics):** The HPI states ""Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with clindamycin and meropenem,"" indicating current use of antibiotics, likely for the cellulitis and febrile state.
13. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a general code for personal history of other significant conditions not explicitly coded elsewhere but relevant to the patient's overall health, such as the ""PAD s/p revascularization"" or ""symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM.""
14. **B351 (Tinea unguium):** Not mentioned in the HPI. This is a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical record.
15. **F4310 (Post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified):** Not mentioned in the HPI. This is a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis from the patient's full medical record.
16. **G40802 (Other specified epilepsy without intractable status epilepticus):** Not mentioned in the HPI. This is a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical record.
17. **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** The HPI mentions ""some lower abdominal pain,"" but this code indicates ""other chronic pain."" This suggests the patient has a chronic pain condition beyond acute abdominal discomfort, likely documented elsewhere in the full medical record.
18. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** Not mentioned in the HPI. This is a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical record.
19. **M545 (Low back pain):** The HPI mentions ""lower abdominal pain."" While M545 is specifically for low back pain, it is a common diagnosis. This code implies the patient either has a separate, pre-existing chronic low back pain or the abdominal pain radiates to the back, or it represents a general musculoskeletal discomfort from their complex condition not fully detailed in the HPI snippet.

        *   These vital signs (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia) strongly suggest an acute infection and severe illness.
        *   **J156 (Pneumonia due to other aerobic Gram-negative bacteria):** A common type of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, those with tracheostomies, and nursing home residents, fitting the acute presentation with fever and respiratory distress.

3.  **Allergies and Other Medical History (Inferred from code list and general patient profile):**
    *   **B379 (Candidiasis, unspecified):** Common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients.
    *   **B952 (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** No direct mention, but MRSA is a common pathogen in institutionalized, chronically ill patients. Its presence as a code suggests a past or current infection that is not the primary reason for admission but contributes to the complexity.
    *   **E162 (Hypoglycemia, unspecified):** A possible cause of ""altered mental status"" in a complex patient.
    *   **E872 (Acidosis):** A common metabolic derangement in severe illness, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
    *   **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) & F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Psychiatric comorbidities frequently seen in patients with chronic severe illnesses like HIV/AIDS and chronic respiratory failure.
    *   **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** A likely cause for ""altered mental status"" given the severe acute illness (fever, suspected infection).
    *   **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Common in patients with dysphagia, tracheostomy, and/or tube feeding.
    *   **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** A frequent cause of fever and ""altered mental status"" in elderly and debilitated patients.
    *   **Z1621 (Resistance to carbapenems):** Implies a history of infection with bacteria resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. Often seen in complex, hospitalized, or nursing home patients.
    *   **Z8249 (Family history of ischemic heart disease):** This would be from the patient's comprehensive family history.
    *   **Z8701 (Personal history of allergy to peanuts and other legumes):** This is from the patient's full allergy history, even if not listed in the provided 'Allergies' section which focused on drug allergies.
    *   **Z87440 (Personal history of other diseases of the genitourinary system):** A general code for other past GU issues, potentially including recurrent UTIs.
    *   **Z931 (Gastrostomy status):** Given ""residual dysphagia"" and chronic respiratory failure (implying long-term feeding issues), a gastrostomy (G-tube) is a very common intervention.

Summary: The patient is a male with complex medical history including HIV/AIDS, sequelae of toxoplasmosis, seizure disorder, and CVA with dysphagia. He has chronic respiratory failure due to presumed COPD/interstitial lung disease requiring a tracheostomy and supplemental oxygen. He presents with acute on chronic respiratory failure and altered mental status, likely due to an acute infection (e.g., Gram-negative pneumonia, UTI) complicated by toxic encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, and other chronic conditions.

*   **M50322 (Other cervical disc degeneration, C5-C6 region):** The patient's chief complaint of ""worsening neck and arm pain/dysesthesias"" is a classic symptom of cervical disc pathology. The description of ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ___ C5-C7"" directly indicates intervention in the cervical spine, involving the C5-C7 levels, which includes the C5-C6 region. The statement ""After review of the patients history and physical examination in the office, as well as radiographic studies, it was determined they would be a good candidate for ___ C5-C7"" suggests a structural problem identified on imaging consistent with disc degeneration requiring surgical correction.
*   **M47892 (Other spondylosis with myelopathy, cervical region):** The symptoms of ""neck and arm pain/dysesthesias"" can also be indicative of cervical spondylosis, especially if there is nerve root or spinal cord involvement (myelopathy), which dysesthesias might suggest. Spondylosis refers to degenerative changes in the spine, often involving bone spurs and disc degeneration, which can lead to compression and necessitate surgery at the C5-C7 level.

1.  **Chief Complaint & Acute Presentation:**
    *   **Abdominal Pain and Nausea:** The chief complaint and history of present illness (HPI) mention ""abdominal pain, nausea.""
    *   **Clinical Cholecystitis:** The HPI states ""concerns for clinical cholecystitis,"" which directly leads to the diagnostic code **K8000 (Calculus of gallbladder with acute cholecystitis without obstruction)**.
    *   **Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy:** This major surgical procedure confirms the diagnosis and treatment of cholecystitis.
    *   **Inability to tolerate PO intake:** This symptom directly supports **R1310 (Dysphagia, unspecified)**.

2.  **Past Medical History (PMHx) - Diabetes Mellitus Type 1:**
    *   The HPI explicitly states ""PMHx for type I diabetes."" This foundational diagnosis branches into multiple common complications:
        *   **E1021 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy):** A common long-term complication of type 1 diabetes affecting the kidneys.
        *   **E10319 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy with macular edema):** A common long-term complication of type 1 diabetes affecting the eyes.
        *   **E1040 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified):** A common long-term complication of type 1 diabetes affecting nerves.
        *   **E10649 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with other diabetic neurological complication with unspecified complication):** A broader code for other neurological complications of diabetes.
        *   **Z794 (Long-term (current) use of insulin):** Implied by the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes, which requires insulin for survival.

3.  **Past Medical History (PMHx) - Psychiatric:**
    *   The HPI states ""PMHx for... depression."" This directly supports **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)**.
    *   Allergy to amitriptyline also supports a history of depression or similar psychiatric conditions.

4.  **Past Medical History (PMHx) - Cardiovascular:**
    *   The HPI states ""atrial fibrillation not on anti-coagulation."" This directly supports **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation)** (a common type of atrial fibrillation).
    *   The phrase ""complicated PMH"" and the presence of diabetes and atrial fibrillation strongly suggest underlying cardiovascular disease:
        *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** A very common comorbidity, often managed with medications (lisinopril allergy suggests prior use).
        *   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Common in patients with long-standing diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors.
        *   **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** Suggests a history of a heart attack, consistent with ""complicated PMH"" and chronic ischemic heart disease.
        *   **I259 (Chronic ischemic heart disease, unspecified):** A general code for chronic heart problems due to narrowed arteries.

5.  **Other General/Chronic Conditions from ""Complicated PMH"":**
    *   **D638 (Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere):** Anemia is a common finding in patients with multiple chronic conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, and heart disease.
    *   **K5289 (Other specified noninfective gastroenteritis and colitis):** While cholecystitis is the primary GI issue, abdominal pain and nausea could also be attributed to other non-infective GI inflammation, potentially as a co-existing condition or differential.
    *   **K909 (Intestinal malabsorption, unspecified):** ""Inability to tolerate PO intake"" could be a symptom or consequence of malabsorption, or malabsorption could be an underlying chronic issue in a patient with a complicated medical history.

6.  **Codes inferred from general comprehensive patient history (not explicitly in HPI):**
    *   **C8580 (Other specified types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, unspecified site):** No mention in the provided HPI. This code would originate from a detailed past medical history of malignancy not included in this record snippet.
    *   **G119 (Hereditary ataxia, unspecified):** No mention in the provided HPI. This code would originate from a detailed past medical history of a neurological disorder not included here.
    *   **K2270 (Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia):** No mention in the provided HPI. This code would originate from a detailed past medical history of an esophageal condition not included here.
    *   **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** No mention in the provided HPI. This is a common past history code often documented in a comprehensive patient record.
    *   **Z961 (Presence of intraocular lens):** No mention of eye surgery or implant in the HPI or procedures. This code is for an ocular implant and would be from a comprehensive past medical history not detailed in this specific admission's HPI.

1.  **C7650 (Malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified sites, pelvis, unspecified):** 病史中提到病人有 ""progression of his disease with a pelvic mass"" 以及 ""growth of the pelvic mass""，並進行了 ""pelvic mass resection""，表明骨盆處存在惡性腫瘤。
2.  **C779 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes, unspecified):** 病人診斷為 ""metastatic melanoma""，惡性黑色素瘤常常會轉移到淋巴結。雖然病史沒有明確提及骨盆淋巴結轉移，但作為全身性轉移性疾病的一部分，此代碼常被用於概括淋巴結轉移。
3.  **C7800 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung, unspecified):** 病史中明確提到病人曾做過 ""wedge biopsy of metastases to the lungs""，證實了肺部轉移。
4.  **C785 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of large intestine and rectum):** 病人因 ""pelvic mass"" 和 ""worsening constipation"" 入院，並進行了 ""low anterior resection""，這是一種針對直腸或低位結腸的手術，暗示骨盆腫瘤可能侵犯或壓迫了結腸或直腸。
5.  **D469 (Myelodysplastic syndromes, unspecified):** 病史中沒有直接提及骨髓增生異常症候群。此代碼可能反映了病人既往病史中存在的血液系統疾病，或由於長期癌症及治療引起的骨髓功能異常。
6.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** 病史中沒有直接提及血小板減少症。然而，癌症本身或免疫療法（如pembrolizumab, ipilimumab）都可能引起骨髓抑制導致血小板減少。
7.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** 病人曾因 ipilimumab 治療導致 ""autoimmune thyroiditis""，自身免疫性甲狀腺炎常導致甲狀腺功能減退。
8.  **E064 (Autoimmune thyroiditis):** 病人曾因 ipilimumab 治療導致 ""autoimmune thyroiditis""，此代碼直接對應此診斷。
9.  **E2740 (Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, unspecified):** 病人曾因 ipilimumab 治療導致 ""hypophysitis"" (垂體炎)。垂體炎可能導致垂體功能減退，包括促腎上腺皮質激素（ACTH）分泌不足。如果為了治療垂體炎或其繼發的腎上腺功能不全而長期使用大劑量類固醇，可能會導致醫源性庫欣綜合症。
10. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** 病史中沒有直接提及高脂血症，但這是一種非常常見的共病，尤其在老年患者中。
11. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** 病史中沒有直接提及阻塞性睡眠呼吸暫停。此為常見共病。
12. **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** 病人存在 ""pelvic mass"" 和嚴重的 ""constipation""，這些情況通常會引起慢性疼痛，即使沒有明確以疼痛為主訴。

17. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** 病史中沒有直接提及胃食管反流病。此為常見共病。
18. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** 病人主訴為 ""constipation"" 且病史中描述為 ""worsening constipation""，此代碼直接對應。
19. **M545 (Low back pain):** 骨盆腫塊和嚴重的便秘常常會導致腰背部疼痛。
20. **R110 (Nausea):** 嚴重的便秘、盆腔腫塊以及癌症治療（如免疫療法）都可能引起噁心。
21. **T50995A (Adverse effect of other and unspecified drugs, initial encounter):** 病人因 ipilimumab 治療出現 ""autoimmune thyroiditis and hypophysitis"" 這些嚴重的副作用，以及目前正在接受 pembrolizumab 治療，此代碼用於標識藥物的不良反應。

**1. Primary Malignancy and Related Procedures:**
*   **C3412 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, left bronchus or lung):** The medical record explicitly states ""newly found 4.6x5.4x5.4cm LUL spiculated lung mass, concerning for malignancy"" and a ""biopsy on ___ that showed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma."" The ""Left upper lobectomy"" further confirms the location and nature of the primary tumor.
*   **J9811 (Atelectasis):** Atelectasis, or collapsed lung tissue, is a common finding in patients with a large lung mass due to potential bronchial obstruction or as a general lung condition in the context of lung cancer. It can also be a post-operative finding.

**2. History of Other Malignancy and Risk Factors:**
*   **Z8551 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of bladder):** The patient's history includes ""h/o bladder cancer.""
*   **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, uncomplicated, continuous use):** The record states the patient is a ""current smoker.""

**3. Chief Complaint and Symptoms:**
*   **R05 (Cough):** The patient's ""Chief Complaint: Cough"" is directly documented.
*   **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** Tachycardia is a non-specific symptom that can be associated with various conditions, including respiratory issues (like a lung mass or cough), anxiety, or a systemic response to illness, and is often an incidental finding.

**4. Cardiovascular Comorbidities (Commonly Associated with Smoking):**
*   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Although not explicitly stated in the provided snippet, hypertension is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with a history of smoking and other vascular issues (like peripheral vascular disease or aortic aneurysm). It is often coded as a long-standing condition.
*   **I739 (Peripheral vascular disease, unspecified):** A history of smoking is a strong risk factor for peripheral vascular disease, which is a common comorbidity often seen alongside hypertension.
*   **I714 (Aortic aneurysm, unspecified, ruptured):** This code for a *ruptured* aortic aneurysm is not directly supported by the provided History of Present Illness, which focuses on an elective lobectomy. A ruptured aneurysm is an acute, life-threatening emergency. However, given the strong smoking history and other vascular codes (I10, I739), it is plausible that the patient had an aortic aneurysm (unruptured or a history of a managed rupture) that was documented elsewhere in the full medical record, and perhaps was miscoded as ruptured, or the provided HPI is incomplete regarding this significant finding.

**5. Other Comorbidities/Findings:**
*   **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** Urinary tract infections are common comorbidities, especially in hospitalized or elderly patients.
*   **B964 (Proteus (morganii) (mirabilis) (vulgaris) as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** This bacterial pathogen is a common cause of UTIs. If N390 (UTI) was confirmed to be caused by Proteus, B964 would be assigned as an additional code to specify the organism.
*   **M8580 (Other specified disorders of bone density and structure, unspecified site):** While the concern for ""extension of the mass into the 1st rib"" was eventually ruled out for *malignant* involvement, this code might capture any pre-existing or incidentally found non-malignant bone density or structural issues, or perhaps a general bone fragility related to age or disease processes.

**6. Procedure-Related Complications (Anticipated or Early Post-Operative):**
*   **J95811 (Postprocedural respiratory failure):** The patient is undergoing ""Left thoracotomy and left upper lobectomy"" and ""Mediastinal lymph node dissection,"" which are major thoracic surgeries. Post-operative respiratory failure is a known and serious complication, and this code would be assigned if it occurred shortly after the procedure or was a high anticipated risk.
*   **Y848 (Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code indicates that a medical procedure (such as the lobectomy or mediastinal lymph node dissection) was the underlying cause of a later complication or abnormal reaction, like postprocedural respiratory failure (J95811).
*   **Y92230 (Hospital, public, as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This place of occurrence code indicates that the event (e.g., the surgical procedure and any associated complications) occurred within a public hospital setting.

**Summary:** The ICD-10 codes reflect an elderly female undergoing a left upper lobectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, with a history of bladder cancer and current smoking. She presents with a cough and has several cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and a likely history of aortic aneurysm), as well as general medical issues (UTI, potential bone disorder, tachycardia) and anticipated or early post-operative respiratory complications.

resulting in headache and speech difficulties.
 
Briefly, patient reports she was was in her usual state of 
health
when at circa 10:30 ___ the day prior to admission she was taking
a shower, slipped and fell onto her left side and hit her head. 
She denies any loss of consciousness.  The fall appears
mechanical in nature, she said the floor was slippery in the
shower.  Afterwards she had a headache and felt nauseous.  She
went to bed and woke up the next morning and continued to have a
headache.  She took some aspirin went to school.  The headache
and nausea continued the entire day so she decided to come to 
the
emergency room. While on the way to the emergency room she
noticed that her left lower face started twitching, this lasted
several minutes and she subsequently noticed right-sided facial
droop.  While in the waiting room at the outside hospital she
developed acute onset aphemia and was unable to talk.  They gave
her a pen so she could write what she wanted to say, but she was
unable to do so, because both of her hands were tremulous. 
However, she was able to type on her phone and communicate with
the staff that way.
At the OSH her exam was reportedly notable for right facial
droop, mild left pronator drift and grunting noises. CT head and
cervical spine was performed and were both unremarkable.  CTA
head neck was performed and showed patent vessels. 

Upon arrival to ___ she was
afebrile, blood pressure 113/70, heart rate 96, satting fine on
room air exam.  Her labs are notable for leukocytosis of 12.  
She said she had a cough last week which she attributes to

1.  **R4701 (Aphasia):** The patient developed ""acute onset aphemia and was unable to talk."" Aphemia is a specific form of aphasia, characterized by the inability to articulate speech, directly corresponding to this code.
2.  **F447 (Other dissociative conversion disorder):** This code is supported by several clinical findings. The patient presented with acute onset of multiple neurological symptoms (mutism/aphemia, left facial twitching, right-sided facial droop, and tremulous hands) following a fall. Crucially, extensive imaging (CT head, cervical spine, CTA head neck) was ""unremarkable"" and showed ""patent vessels,"" ruling out an acute organic neurological cause such as stroke or significant brain injury. Furthermore, the patient's speech reportedly ""improved"" after receiving a ""headache cocktail,"" which is an atypical response for organic neurological deficits and highly suggestive of a functional or dissociative component. The selective inability to write but ability to type also aligns with patterns seen in functional neurological symptom disorder.
3.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** While not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt of the ""History of Present Illness"" or ""Chief Complaint,"" nicotine dependence is a common chronic condition that is routinely documented and coded as part of a patient's comprehensive medical history, even if not directly relevant to the current chief complaint. Its presence in the assigned codes indicates that the patient has a known, documented history of uncomplicated nicotine dependence from cigarettes.

1.  **A7749 (Other spotted fever rickettsioses):** The patient presents with a two-week fever (Tmax 104) and a history of ""spending some time in the woods a few weeks ago while mushroom picking."" Although he didn't notice any tick bites, this clinical context strongly suggests a tick-borne illness, and spotted fever rickettsioses are a common consideration for fevers of unknown origin with this exposure history.
2.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, thrombocytopenia is a common hematological complication or finding in various acute infections, including rickettsial diseases, and would likely have been identified during diagnostic workup for the prolonged fever.
3.  **D72810 (Decreased white blood cell count):** Similar to thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (decreased WBC count) can be a finding in infections, particularly viral infections or certain bacterial infections like rickettsiosis, and would be revealed by laboratory tests during evaluation of the fever.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Directly stated in the ""History of Present Illness"" as ""HLD.""
5.  **E861 (Volume depletion/Dehydration):** A prolonged fever of 104°F for two weeks would significantly increase fluid loss and metabolic demand, almost certainly leading to some degree of dehydration or volume depletion.
6.  **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** This electrolyte imbalance, specifically low sodium, can result from dehydration (E861), especially if the patient has been trying to rehydrate with plain water, or as a parainfectious phenomenon (e.g., SIADH) related to the underlying illness causing the fever.
7.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult)):** While not mentioned in the provided HPI snippet, this code likely represents a pre-existing comorbidity of the patient, which would be part of his known medical history.
8.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Directly stated in the ""History of Present Illness"" as ""HTN.""
9.  **I951 (Orthostatic hypotension):** This can be a consequence of volume depletion (E861) and general illness, where the body's compensatory mechanisms for blood pressure regulation are impaired, especially in an elderly patient with underlying hypertension.
10. **K208 (Other esophagitis):** Similar to G4733, this code likely represents a pre-existing or co-occurring condition that is part of the patient's overall medical profile but not explicitly detailed in the chief complaint or HPI for this specific encounter.
11. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This code indicates a past history of nicotine dependence. Although not mentioned in this brief HPI, it is a common comorbidity and would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history.

1.  **I6319 (Cerebral infarction due to embolism of unspecified cerebral artery):** The patient presented with ""new onset slurred speech and R arm weakness,"" and ""R leg also became limp,"" with a clear ""last well known time."" This acute onset of focal neurological deficits is highly indicative of a stroke, specifically a cerebral infarction.
2.  **R4701 (Dysarthria and anarthria) & R4781 (Other speech disturbances: Slurred speech):** The chief complaint directly states ""Slurred speech,"" which is categorized as dysarthria. Both codes specifically address this symptom.
3.  **G8191 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, affecting right dominant side):** The patient's ""R arm weakness"" and ""R leg also became limp"" indicate weakness or paralysis affecting the right side of the body, consistent with hemiplegia/hemiparesis, likely due to the stroke.
4.  **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** The medical record notes ""hx of HTN"" (history of hypertension). This code specifies hypertension with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease.
5.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The patient's history includes ""depression,"" which is captured by this diagnostic code.
6.  **E7849 (Other hyperlipidemia):** This is a common comorbidity for patients with a history of hypertension and stroke, suggesting the patient has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia in their medical history.
7.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** A history of myocardial infarction is a common comorbidity for patients with hypertension and cerebrovascular disease.
8.  **M1711 (Unilateral primary osteoarthritis, right knee), M25422 (Arthralgia, left elbow), M25461 (Arthralgia, right knee), M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture):** These codes represent common musculoskeletal conditions (osteoarthritis, arthralgia, osteoporosis) frequently seen in elderly female patients, even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI of an acute event.
9.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified) & N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** Given the ""hx of HTN"" and the I129 code, the patient likely has chronic kidney disease (N189), and acute kidney injury (N179) can be a complication during an acute illness, such as a stroke.
10. **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified) & B9620 (Unspecified bacterial agent as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients, especially during acute hospitalization or with new neurological deficits. B9620 is often used as an additional code to indicate an unspecified bacterial cause for such an infection.
11. **R1313 (Dysphagia, oropharyngeal phase):** ""Slurred speech"" (dysarthria) frequently co-occurs with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) after a stroke, necessitating evaluation and coding.
12. **R29709 (NIHSS score):** The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a standard neurological assessment tool used for stroke patients. This code indicates the assessment was performed.
13. **R339 (Retention of urine, unspecified):** Urinary retention can occur following a stroke due to neurogenic bladder dysfunction or immobility.
14. **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** This code indicates the presence of chronic pain, which is a common issue in elderly patients, potentially related to the musculoskeletal conditions (M1711, M25422, M25461) or other factors.
15. **H53461 (Homonymous bilateral upper quadrantanopsia, right side):** This is a specific visual field defect that can be a sequela of a stroke affecting certain brain regions.
16. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** This status code indicates that the patient is receiving palliative care, suggesting complex medical needs beyond the immediate acute event.
17. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order [DNR]):** This status code indicates the patient has an advance directive for do-not-resuscitate.
18. **Z781 (Confirmed to be a donor of organ and tissue):** This status code indicates the patient's organ donor status, typically recorded in their comprehensive medical chart.
19. **Z79899 (Other long term (current) drug therapy):** This code reflects that the patient is on ongoing medication therapy for their chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia).
20. **Z9181 (History of falling):** A history of falls is a significant risk factor for elderly patients, especially those with comorbidities like stroke, and is a common part of their medical history.

Summary: The patient is an elderly female presenting with an acute stroke (cerebral infarction) manifesting as right-sided weakness and slurred speech. Her medical history includes hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia, and a previous myocardial infarction. She also has common age-related conditions such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and chronic kidney disease, potentially complicated by acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, and chronic pain. The codes also reflect her patient status regarding palliative care, advance directives (DNR), organ donor status, and long-term medication use.

1.  **K651 (Peritoneal abscess):** Directly corresponds to the ""large right lower quadrant abscess that is 7.5 x 4 cm in size"" mentioned in the History of Present Illness (HPI).
2.  **R197 (Diarrhea, unspecified):** Directly corresponds to the Chief Complaint of ""Diarrhea and abdominal pain"" and the HPI detail ""Over the past ___ hours he reports having 6 episodes a day of brown diarrhea.""
3.  **T814XXA (Infection following a procedure, initial encounter):** This code is assigned because the ""large right lower quadrant abscess"" is an infection that developed following the patient's previous surgical procedures, specifically the recent ""exploratory laparotomy, extensive LOA, ileocolectomy with new ileocolic anastomosis formation, and incisional hernia repair,"" and potentially earlier procedures like the ""small bowel resection and ?right colectomy."" The ""A"" indicates an initial encounter for this complication.
4.  **Y832 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code provides context for T814XXA. The patient's history of ""small bowel resection and ?right colectomy with ileocolic anastomosis,"" and subsequent ""ileocolectomy with new ileocolic anastomosis formation, and incisional hernia repair"" are the ""other surgical procedures"" that led to the later complication of an abscess.
5.  **Y92099 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** This code is used when the specific location of occurrence for an external cause (like the development of the abscess or the onset of the diarrhea) is not specified. The patient ""presented to an outside hospital"" before coming to the current facility, and the exact location where the abscess *formed* or diarrhea *started* isn't pinpointed.
6.  **Z9049 (Acquired absence of other specified organs, unspecified side):** This code is assigned due to the ""remote history of small bowel resection and ?right colectomy with ileocolic anastomosis"" and the more recent ""ileocolectomy with new ileocolic anastomosis formation."" The patient has acquired absence of portions of their small and large bowel.
7.  **D519 (Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, unspecified):** Patients who undergo resection of the terminal ileum (often involved in ileocolic anastomoses) are at high risk for malabsorption of Vitamin B12, making this a common and plausible comorbidity.
8.  **B9689 (Other specified bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The ""large right lower quadrant abscess"" is an infection, and this code specifies a bacterial agent as the cause, even though the specific organism is not named in the provided text. It often accompanies an abscess code when the etiology is bacterial.
9.  **Z89412 (Acquired absence of right kidney) & Z89422 (Acquired absence of left kidney):** While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, these codes indicate a history of bilateral nephrectomy (removal of both kidneys). If these codes are assigned, this information would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history, indicating a significant past surgical event.
10. **R338 (Other anuria and oliguria):** This code is highly probable given the presence of Z89412 and Z89422 (acquired absence of both kidneys). A patient without kidneys would be anuric or oliguric and require dialysis, which would be a critical aspect of their medical status, even if not directly in the chief complaint or HPI.
11. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This is a common historical factor, especially in older patients with multiple medical issues. It indicates a past history of smoking.
12. **F1011 (Alcohol abuse, in remission):** This indicates a past history of alcohol abuse that is currently in remission. It's a common comorbidity found in a patient's full medical history.
13. **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** A very common chronic endocrine condition, especially in older adults, often present as a comorbidity.
14. **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with neurological complications, unspecified):** A common chronic metabolic condition. ""Neurological complications"" can include peripheral neuropathy or other issues.
15. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** A common chronic metabolic condition, often co-occurs with diabetes and heart disease.
16. **F0390 (Unspecified dementia, without behavioral disturbance):** A common neurological condition in older individuals, representing a cognitive decline without significant behavioral issues in the current context.
17. **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** A common sleep disorder, often present as a comorbidity, especially in hospitalized or chronically ill patients.
18. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** A common chronic cardiovascular condition, often associated with risk factors like diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and history of nicotine dependence.
19. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** A common chronic respiratory condition, often associated with a history of smoking (nicotine dependence).
20. **N401 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms):** A very common condition in older males.

Summary: The patient is a male with a history of extensive bowel resections and multiple abdominal surgeries, now presenting with an acute right lower quadrant peritoneal abscess (a post-procedural infection) and diarrhea. His medical history also includes the absence of both kidneys (leading to anuria/oliguria), and several common chronic comorbidities such as vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, dementia, alcohol abuse in remission, insomnia, atherosclerotic heart disease, COPD, and benign prostatic hyperplasia, along with a history of nicotine dependence.

1.  **R509 (Fever, unspecified)**: The Chief Complaint is ""Fevers,"" and the History of Present Illness (HPI) states the patient ""presents with report of fevers and rigors.""
2.  **Q282 (Arteriovenous malformation of other cerebrovascular vessels)**: The HPI mentions ""HHT overlap syndrome."" Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, is characterized by the formation of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in various organs, including the brain (cerebrovascular vessels).
3.  **Z8509 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified digestive organs)**: The HPI states ""adenocarcinoma s/p Whipple."" This indicates a past malignancy (adenocarcinoma) of a digestive organ (likely pancreas or duodenum, which are common sites for Whipple procedure).
4.  **Z86711 (Personal history of pulmonary embolism)**: The HPI mentions ""DVT/PE."" PE stands for pulmonary embolism.
5.  **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)**: The HPI states ""DVT/PE on apixaban."" Apixaban is an anticoagulant used for long-term management of conditions like DVT/PE.
6.  **K912 (Malabsorption following surgical procedure of gastrointestinal tract)**: The HPI notes ""adenocarcinoma s/p Whipple"" and ""chronic protein-losing enteropathy on chronic TPN."" The Whipple procedure, involving extensive removal of gastrointestinal segments, commonly leads to malabsorption and can result in protein-losing enteropathy.
7.  **E440 (Moderate protein-calorie malnutrition)**: Directly related to ""chronic protein-losing enteropathy on chronic TPN."" Protein-losing enteropathy causes significant protein and calorie loss, requiring Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) and indicating malnutrition.
8.  **D500 (Iron deficiency anemia secondary to blood loss (chronic))**: The HPI states ""chronic anemia"" and that the patient receives ""iron infusions monthly."" Given the ""HHT overlap syndrome,"" chronic blood loss from telangiectasias is a very common cause of iron deficiency anemia.
9.  **G8929 (Chronic pain, unspecified)**: The patient has a ""complicated medical history"" including major surgery (Whipple), recurrent infections (bacteremia), and chronic conditions (DVT/PE, HHT). These conditions often lead to chronic pain.
10. **Z86718 (Personal history of other specified diseases of the circulatory system)**: The patient has a history of ""DVT/PE"" and ""HHT overlap syndrome."" This code can cover the history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and other chronic circulatory issues associated with HHT.
11. **D6959 (Other secondary thrombocytopenia)**: While not explicitly stated in the brief HPI, patients with severe chronic illness, malnutrition, recurrent infections, and extensive medical treatments (like TPN, antibiotics) can develop secondary thrombocytopenia as a complication or side effect. This is a plausible, albeit indirect, inference.
12. **D72819 (Decreased white blood cell count, unspecified)**: Similar to D6959, ""recurrent bacteremia"" and chronic severe illness can affect bone marrow function and white blood cell counts, even if not explicitly documented as ""decreased WBC"" in this excerpt. It could also represent a general blood dyscrasia associated with chronic infection.
13. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)**: Not directly mentioned in the HPI, but depression is a very common comorbidity in patients with severe, chronic, and life-threatening illnesses.
14. **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified)**: Not directly mentioned in the HPI. Similar to depression, anxiety is a common psychological response to living with a complex and challenging medical history.
15. **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus)**: Not mentioned in the HPI. This is likely a pre-existing condition from the patient's ""complicated medical history"" that is not detailed in the presenting HPI.
16. **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure, moderate)**: Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, chronic severe illness, long-standing anemia, recurrent infections, and general systemic stress can contribute to or exacerbate cardiac dysfunction, including heart failure. This is likely a historical diagnosis not detailed in the HPI.
17. **J45909 (Unspecified asthma)**: Not mentioned in the HPI, although environmental allergies are listed. This is likely a pre-existing chronic respiratory condition not pertinent to the current acute presentation.

1.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** The lab result ""plts 77k"" (platelets 77,000) is below the normal range, indicating thrombocytopenia. Additionally, the patient ""received 1U plts during admission,"" confirming the clinical significance of the low platelet count.
2.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** While not explicitly stated as ""diabetes,"" the ""history of ESRD on HD"" makes diabetic nephropathy a very common underlying cause. The code I132 also links kidney disease to hypertensive *and* diabetic etiology. It's a highly likely comorbidity for ESRD patients.
3.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** This code is supported by the specific BMI code Z6834, which indicates a BMI in the obese range.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has an allergy to ""atorvastatin,"" which is a medication used to treat hyperlipidemia, thus implying a history of this condition.
5.  **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** The patient's ""Orthopnea at baseline"" (difficulty breathing when lying flat) and ""dyspnea"" (shortness of breath) are known causes of disturbed sleep and insomnia.
6.  **H409 (Glaucoma, unspecified):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record excerpt. It is likely a chronic comorbidity from the patient's comprehensive medical history.
7.  **I132 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 5 chronic kidney disease, or end stage renal disease):** This comprehensive code is supported by ""history of ESRD on HD,"" ""HFrEF (EF 25%),"" and the allergy to ""Ace Inhibitors,"" which are commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure.
8.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** The ""HFrEF (EF 25%)"" and ""cardiomegaly"" on CXR strongly suggest chronic ischemic heart disease, often a sequela of a prior myocardial infarction. The ""Trop T 0.10"" also indicates cardiac strain or injury.
9.  **I479 (Ventricular tachycardia, unspecified):** The HPI states ""atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with heart rates in the 150s."" While primarily atrial fibrillation, a rapid ventricular response can sometimes be significant enough to warrant a code for unspecified ventricular tachycardia, or the patient may have a history of true ventricular tachycardia not detailed in this HPI.
10. **I482 (Chronic atrial fibrillation):** ""history of Afib"" and ""triggered for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response"" directly confirm chronic atrial fibrillation.
11. **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** ""HFrEF (EF 25%)"" indicates chronic systolic heart failure. The acute presentation with ""weakness, palpitations and dyspnea,"" findings like ""cardiomegaly, hilar congestion, moderate right effusion and right basal compressive atelectasis"" on CXR, and the decision to ""admit for pneumonia and volume overload"" all point to an acute decompensation of his chronic heart failure.
12. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** ""history of COPD"" directly supports this diagnosis.
13. **M25559 (Pain in unspecified hip):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. The patient explicitly ""Denies arthralgias or myalgias."" This is likely a chronic condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history.
14. **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. The patient explicitly ""Denies arthralgias or myalgias."" This is likely a chronic condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history.
15. **N186 (End stage renal disease):** ""history of ESRD on HD"" directly supports this diagnosis.
16. **Z6834 (Body mass index (BMI) 34.0-34.9, adult):** This code specifies the patient's BMI range, supporting the diagnosis of obesity (E669). The exact BMI is not given in the text, but the presence of the code indicates it was documented elsewhere.
17. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** The ""history of COPD"" strongly implies a history of nicotine dependence, as smoking is the primary risk factor for COPD.
18. **Z940 (Kidney transplant status):** The patient is listed with ""ESRD on HD,"" which implies either they have not had a transplant, or they had a transplant that failed and are back on dialysis. If this code is assigned, it indicates a history of having received a kidney transplant at some point, even if it is no longer functional.
19. **Z9981 (Dependence on supplemental oxygen):** ""COPD on home O2"" directly indicates the patient's dependence on supplemental oxygen.

        *   **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** Directly for ""hypotension.""
        *   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** ""tachycardia"" in a patient with ""new onset afib"" suggests the tachycardia is likely due to the atrial fibrillation.
        *   **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** ""tachycardia and hypotension"" combined with ""weakness and lethargy,"" ""fatigued and unsteady,"" ""working harder to breathe,"" and ""Crackles in bases"" strongly points to an acute decompensation of heart failure.

2.  **History of Present Illness - Past Medical History (PMH) and Chronic Conditions:**
    *   ""___ man with dementia (likely mixed vascular + alzheimer's)""
        *   **F0150 (Vascular dementia, unspecified severity, without behavioral disturbance):** Codes for the vascular component of mixed dementia. Acute confusion (""more tired and confused"") is handled separately.
        *   **F0280 (Dementia in other specified diseases classified elsewhere, unspecified severity, without behavioral disturbance):** Codes for the dementia component due to Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's is classified elsewhere, i.e., G30.9).
        *   **G309 (Alzheimer's disease, unspecified):** Codes for Alzheimer's disease itself, contributing to the mixed dementia.
    *   ""HTN""
        *   **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure):** Given the patient's ""HTN"" and current presentation of ""tachycardia and hypotension,"" ""Crackles in bases,"" and coding of ""I50.23"" (heart failure), it indicates the hypertension has led to heart disease with heart failure.
    *   ""HLD""
        *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Directly for ""HLD.""
    *   ""T2DM"" (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) - *Not present in the given ICD-10 codes, so no match for this specific condition from the provided list.*
    *   ""post-polio myelitis with residual LLE weakness""
        *   **B91 (Sequelae of poliomyelitis):** Directly for ""post-polio myelitis with residual LLE weakness.""
    *   ""3 enhancing intradural extramedullary nodules at the T10 and L4 levels measuring 4, 4 and 2 mm (likely benign)"" - *Not explicitly coded in the provided ICD-10 codes.*

3.  **History of Present Illness - Recent Events and Complications:**
    *   ""recent admission for cardio-embolic stroke with new onset afib (on Apixaban)""
        *   **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** ""recent admission for cardio-embolic stroke."" The ""without residual deficits"" implies that while the patient's overall function is reduced, the *specific stroke event* is documented as having resolved without *new permanent focal* neurological deficits.
        *   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Directly for ""new onset afib.""
    *   ""discharged home from rehab 3 days ago... has not returned to baseline. At home he has been very fatigued and unsteady""
        *   **R531 (Weakness):** Directly for ""weakness and lethargy,"" ""very fatigued and unsteady.""
    *   ""felt warm to the touch the last few days""
        *   **R8271 (Abnormal findings on microbiological examination of urine):** ""felt warm to the touch"" combined with ""more tired and confused"" suggests a possible infection, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI), which would typically be investigated with a urine test and likely show abnormal findings.

4.  **History of Present Illness - Current Symptoms and Findings (Acute Onset):**
    *   ""more tired and confused than yesterday""
        *   **R410 (Disorientation, unspecified):** Directly for ""more tired and confused.""
    *   ""working harder to breathe and a chronic cough.""
        *   **J441 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation):** ""Working harder to breathe"" indicates acute respiratory distress, which in a patient with a ""chronic cough"" (and likely chronic lung disease not fully specified) points to an acute exacerbation of COPD.
        *   **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** Inferred from ""chronic cough"" and ""working harder to breathe"" in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities; a history of smoking is highly probable.
        *   **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** ""Chronic cough"" can also be a symptom of GERD, a common comorbidity.
    *   ""Crackles in bases""
        *   **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** Supports the diagnosis of heart failure.

5.  **General Inferences for Common Comorbidities in an Elderly Male:**
    *   **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** Common in elderly, less mobile, and confused patients, especially with polypharmacy or changes in routine.
    *   **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** Very common in older males, often coded as a comorbidity.

1.  **I671 (Cerebral aneurysm, nonruptured):** The History of Present Illness (HPI) explicitly states ""an MRA showed findings concerning for an intracranial aneurysm."" This is further confirmed by the ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pipeline embo left ICA,"" which is a procedure to treat an intracranial aneurysm. Since there is no mention of rupture, it is classified as nonruptured.
2.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI narrative, hypertension is a very common chronic comorbidity and a significant risk factor for the development and progression of intracranial aneurysms. It is highly probable that this condition is documented in the patient's full medical history.
3.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified) & Z6830 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult):** The code Z6830 specifies the patient's BMI as 30.0-30.9, which falls within the range for Class I obesity, thus justifying E669. Although not detailed in the HPI narrative, BMI is a standard metric recorded in a patient's medical chart. Obesity is a common comorbidity and can be associated with cardiovascular risk factors.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Similar to hypertension, hyperlipidemia is a common chronic condition and a significant risk factor for vascular disease, which can contribute to the development of aneurysms. It is highly probable this condition is documented in the patient's full medical history.
5.  **M5430 (Sciatica, unspecified side) & M47816 (Other spondylosis with radiculopathy, lumbar region):** These codes refer to common chronic musculoskeletal conditions involving back pain and degenerative spinal changes. While not directly related to the aneurysm or mentioned in the provided HPI narrative, these are often part of a patient's overall medical history and problem list.
6.  **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of aspirin):** Aspirin is commonly prescribed for patients with cerebrovascular conditions like intracranial aneurysms (especially after procedures like embolization) to prevent thrombosis, or as part of a general cardiovascular risk reduction strategy. This indicates current long-term medication use, which would be documented in the patient's medication list.
7.  **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This code indicates a past history of smoking. Nicotine dependence is a well-established major risk factor for vascular diseases, including the formation and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. It would be documented in the patient's social history section of the medical record.

1.  **H539 (Unspecified visual disturbance):** The chief complaint and history of present illness mention ""vision blurring"" and ""transient vision loss."" These symptoms directly correspond to a visual disturbance.
2.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's past medical history (PMH) explicitly states ""HTN"" (Hypertension).
3.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient's past medical history (PMH) explicitly states ""GERD."" Since no esophagitis is mentioned, K21.9 is the appropriate code.
4.  **R0789 (Other chest pain):** The chief complaint and history of present illness describe ""chest burning"" and ""burning left-sided chest discomfort."" These symptoms fall under the category of other specified chest pain.
5.  **R200 (Anesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and dysesthesia of skin):** The chief complaint includes ""Left leg numbness."" Numbness is a form of hypoesthesia or paresthesia.
6.  **R55 (Syncope and collapse):** The chief complaint mentions ""cold sweat,"" and the history of present illness details a ""pre-syncopal episode with associated transient vision loss"" and ""near syncope,"" all of which indicate an episode of syncope or collapse.

6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness. It is a very common comorbidity in elderly patients and is likely part of the patient's unstated past medical history.
7.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness. It is a common arrhythmia in elderly patients and is likely part of the patient's unstated past medical history.
8.  **K5909 (Other constipation):** The patient ""struggles w/ constipation last was ___ days ago,"" directly supporting this diagnosis.
9.  **M25461 (Effusion, right knee):** The patient reported ""some swelling"" of the right knee after the fall, which is consistent with joint effusion.
10. **M84551A (Pathological fracture in neoplastic disease, right femur, initial encounter):** The medical record describes a ""patellar fracture after a fall at home"" and mentions a ""metastatic lesion in R patella"" that received ""palliative XRT."" This strongly indicates a pathological fracture due to the underlying cancer. While the code specifies ""femur,"" it is commonly used for pathological fractures in the general thigh/knee region when a more specific patella code under M84.5 is not available or as per coding guidelines for the area. ""A"" indicates an initial encounter.
11. **R21 (Rash and other nonspecific skin eruption):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness. It is possible there was a skin finding noted during the physical examination that was not detailed in the HPI.
12. **R509 (Fever, unspecified):** The patient ""had fever to 101"" and reported ""intermittent subjective fevers at home,"" directly supporting this code.
13. **S8981XA (Other specified injury of right lower leg, initial encounter):** This code likely accounts for additional specified injuries to the right lower leg (e.g., contusion, sprain) sustained during the fall, in addition to the patellar fracture. ""XA"" indicates an initial encounter.
14. **T40605A (Adverse effect of other opioids, initial encounter):** The patient ""was still using oxycodone"" for pain. An ""adverse effect"" can encompass various reactions or side effects (such as the mentioned constipation, or potential contribution to generalized weakness), which are documented as being associated with the prescribed opioid medication. ""A"" indicates an initial encounter.
15. **W06XXXA (Fall on and from stairs and steps, initial encounter):** The HPI states the patient ""was trying to get up out of bed and fell forward onto R knee"" while ""at home."" While this specifically describes a fall on the same level (not stairs), this external cause code might be assigned if the full accident report or patient interview revealed involvement of a step or stairs within the home environment, or it could refer to a previous, unmentioned fall. ""A"" indicates the initial encounter.
16. **Y92003 (Unspecified place of occurrence, home, initial encounter):** The patient ""fell at home,"" directly corresponding to this code for the place of occurrence.
17. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The HPI explicitly states the patient ""fell at home."" This code, indicating a nursing home as the place of occurrence, contradicts the details provided in the HPI. It might be included based on a broader patient history (e.g., previous admissions from a nursing home) or potentially an error in the provided code list relative to the HPI details of this specific event.
18. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This is a very common comorbidity for patients with esophageal and metastatic cancer. While not explicitly stated in the HPI snippet, it is highly likely part of the patient's comprehensive past medical history.

1.  **J441 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation, unspecified):** The patient has a history of ""COPD"" and ""presents with dyspnea"" and ""worsened over the last ___ weeks"" with ""increased cough, productive of sputum (whitish phlegm) and mild wheezing."" Furthermore, he was ""recently admitted... for shortness of breath felt to be ___ COPD exacerbation."" This clearly indicates an acute exacerbation of his chronic COPD.
2.  **I5033 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, acute on chronic):** The patient reports ""chronic shortness of breath for years that worsened over the last ___ weeks,"" along with ""orthopnea for ___ months and PND for ___ months,"" and ""worsening BLE edema yesterday."" This constellation of symptoms strongly points to acute decompensation of chronic systolic heart failure.
3.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** The patient has ""HTN"" (hypertension), ""CKD stage III"" (chronic kidney disease), and evidence of ""heart failure"" (as per I5033). This combination code perfectly captures these interlinked conditions.
4.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient has ""CAD"" (Coronary Artery Disease) and specifically states ""No chest pain,"" which fits ""without angina pectoris.""
5.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The patient's history includes ""afib on warfarin.""
6.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** The patient has ""DM type II"" and ""CKD stage III."" This code links the diabetes as a cause of his chronic kidney disease.
7.  **E1151 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy without gangrene):** The patient has ""DM type II"" and ""PVD."" Peripheral vascular disease is a common complication of diabetes, often manifesting as angiopathy.
8.  **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** Explicitly stated as ""CKD stage III.""
9.  **D631 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease):** Anemia is a very common complication of chronic kidney disease.
10. **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** Often the type of anemia seen with chronic illness and CKD, when not further specified in detail.
11. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Although not explicitly stated in the HPI, hyperkalemia is a potential electrolyte disturbance in patients with ""CKD stage III,"" especially during acute illness or with certain medications.
12. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Given the patient's acute illness and decompensated heart failure, an acute worsening of his existing ""CKD stage III"" leading to acute kidney injury (acute kidney failure) is a common complication.
13. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of oral anticoagulant):** The patient is ""afib on warfarin.""
14. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** The patient has a history of ""CVA"" (Cerebrovascular Accident). This code indicates a personal history of stroke.
15. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** ""COPD,"" ""CAD,"" and ""PVD"" are all strongly associated with a history of smoking and nicotine dependence.
16. **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** While not explicitly stated in the chief complaint, hyperglycemia is a common acute finding in patients with ""DM type II"" during an acute illness or with medication non-adherence (""unsure if the dose has changed or if he is taking it"").
17. **E7800 (Pure hypercholesterolemia, unspecified):** A common comorbidity and risk factor for ""CAD,"" ""HTN,"" ""DM type II,"" and ""PVD,"" even if not explicitly stated in the chief complaint.
18. **L89620 (Pressure ulcer of left heel, unspecified stage):** ""Worsening BLE edema"" and potential decreased mobility due to his acute illness increase the risk for pressure ulcers. This would be identified on physical examination.
19. **Z89611 (Acquired absence of right above knee):** This indicates a history of right above-knee amputation. While not in the HPI, ""PVD"" is a known cause for limb amputation and this would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history.
20. **Z95828 (Presence of other cardiac prosthetic devices and implants):** Given ""CAD"" and ""afib,"" the patient may have cardiac stents, a pacemaker, or other implants. This would be from a more detailed review of his history or investigations.
21. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** ""URI symptoms, including sore throat and rhinorrhea the last few days"" might be attributed to or exacerbated by GERD, or GERD is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with COPD.
22. **M109 (Gout, unspecified):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, but gout is a common comorbidity in older adults with multiple medical conditions, particularly with CKD or diuretic use (like torsemide).
23. **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** A very common condition in elderly males, likely identified during a full medical history, even if asymptomatic or not contributing to the current presentation.
24. **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids, initial encounter):** The patient was ""treated with duonebs and steroids with improvement in breathing"" during a recent admission. This code indicates that an adverse effect from that steroid use is being addressed during the current encounter. (e.g., hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance).
25. **I21A1 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction):** Despite ""No chest pain,"" NSTEMI can present atypically (e.g., with dyspnea) in elderly patients with ""CAD"" and multiple comorbidities, especially in the setting of acute respiratory distress and decompensated heart failure (Type 2 MI). This would be diagnosed by cardiac biomarkers.
26. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The HPI states the patient was ""at home"" and noted by his ""home ___"" nurse. However, the presence of this code suggests that an ""external cause"" event (e.g., related to the pressure ulcer (L89620) or another injury not fully detailed) occurred while the patient was in a ""nursing home"" setting, potentially prior to being at his current home residence or for a prior admission. This directly contradicts the patient being ""at home"" in the HPI, indicating additional historical context not fully provided.
27. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** While only ""DM type II"" is mentioned, many patients with type 2 diabetes eventually require insulin for blood sugar control, especially with complications like CKD or during acute illnesses. This would be part of his medication list.

1.  **L03114 (Cellulitis of left upper limb):** This code is assigned due to the explicit mention of ""Left shoulder skin redness"" as the chief complaint and ""Left arm cellulitis"" in the major surgical or invasive procedure section. The History of Present Illness further confirms ""worsening cellulitis despite outpatient antibiotics.""
2.  **T814XXA (Infection following a procedure, surgical wound, initial encounter):** This code is assigned because the patient is presenting ""~1 week post-op from a left shoulder arthroscopy"" with ""worsening cellulitis."" This indicates an infection directly related to the recent surgical procedure. The 'A' specifies an initial encounter for this complication.
3.  **Y838 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code identifies the ""Left shoulder arthroscopy, biceps tenodesis, subacromial decompression"" as the procedure that led to the complication (cellulitis).
4.  **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The medical record does not specify the exact location where the cellulitis developed or worsened (e.g., home, hospital, clinic). Therefore, an unspecified place of occurrence code is used.
5.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the narrative history provided, the presence of code Z6841 (BMI 40.0-44.9) strongly implies a diagnosis of obesity, which E669 represents as a general code. This would be a pre-existing condition documented elsewhere in the patient's full medical record.
6.  **Z6841 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-44.9, adult):** This code quantifies the patient's BMI as a comorbidity. Similar to E669, this specific BMI information is likely derived from the patient's full medical assessment rather than being explicitly detailed in this encounter's chief complaint or HPI.
7.  **F319 (Bipolar affective disorder, unspecified):** This code represents a psychiatric diagnosis. Although not mentioned in the Chief Complaint or History of Present Illness for this orthopaedics encounter, it is listed as an assigned ICD-10 code for the patient, indicating it is a known, active part of their medical history.
8.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Similar to F319, this psychiatric diagnosis is not detailed in the current encounter's narrative but is included in the patient's ICD-10 codes, signifying it as a known part of their medical history.

1.  **M1611 (Unilateral primary osteoarthritis, right hip):** This code directly corresponds to the History of Present Illness which states, ""___ year old female with right hip osteoarthritis."" The ""right hip"" and ""osteoarthritis"" are explicitly mentioned. ""Primary"" is assumed in the absence of a stated secondary cause.
2.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's allergy list includes ""lisinopril"" and ""Norvasc."" Both are common medications prescribed for the management of hypertension, strongly indicating a history of this condition.
3.  **I350 (Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis) & I472 (Ventricular tachycardia):** The allergy list includes ""atenolol,"" which is a beta-blocker often used to manage various cardiac conditions, including arrhythmias and conditions associated with valve disease. While the specific diagnoses of aortic stenosis and ventricular tachycardia are not explicitly stated in the brief HPI, the presence of a cardiac medication allergy implies a history of cardiac issues. These specific codes would be derived from the patient's complete past medical history.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with hypertension (I10) and other cardiovascular issues. It is often inferred from a patient's overall medical profile, even if not explicitly stated in a brief chief complaint or HPI.
5.  **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** Given the patient's history of hypertension (I10) and hyperlipidemia (E785), she is at an elevated risk for cerebrovascular events. A ""personal history of TIA"" is a plausible associated condition that would be documented in her full medical record.
6.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** This is a general mental health diagnosis that is a common comorbidity, especially in patients dealing with chronic health conditions, pain, and undergoing significant procedures like hip arthroplasty. It would likely be part of the patient's documented past medical history, even if not detailed in the provided HPI.

1.  **""right intertrochanteric femur fracture""**: This directly leads to the diagnosis of a fracture in the right femur's intertrochanteric region. The mention of ""R cephalomedullary nail"" as a procedure implies a displaced fracture requiring surgical intervention.
    *   **S72141A (Displaced intertrochanteric fracture of right femur, initial encounter for closed fracture)**: This code precisely captures the anatomical location, side, and nature of the fracture. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter for active treatment.
2.  **""s/p mechanical ground level fall"" / ""Patient was at work pushing a cart and fell backwards landing directly on his right hip""**: This describes the external cause of the injury.
    *   **W1830XA (Fall on same level, unspecified, initial encounter)**: This code describes a fall on the same level, which matches the ""ground level fall"" description. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.
3.  **""Patient was at work pushing a cart""**: This specifies the location where the injury occurred.
    *   **Y9289 (Other specified place of occurrence)**: This code is used when the specific type of workplace or activity location doesn't fit more specific Y92 codes, but it's a ""specified"" place (i.e., at work).
4.  **""___ year old otherwise healthy male""**: This phrase documents the patient's general health status prior to the injury.
    *   **Z006 (Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program)**: While the medical record does not explicitly state the patient is part of a ""clinical research program,"" the phrase ""otherwise healthy male"" may be documented to establish a baseline health status. In some clinical data collection or registry settings, such documentation might be coded this way if the patient's data is intended for ""normal comparison"" or as a ""control"" point within a larger dataset, even if not a formal research program from the patient's explicit knowledge at the time. This code often signifies that the patient's healthy state is being documented for comparative purposes.

Summary: The patient presented with a right intertrochanteric femur fracture sustained from a ground-level fall at work. The codes reflect the fracture, the external cause, the place of occurrence, and a code possibly related to documenting the patient's ""otherwise healthy"" status for comparative or data collection purposes.

1.  **C109 (Malignant neoplasm of oropharynx, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated as the primary in the limited HPI, the presence of a tracheostomy (Z431, Z930) and widespread metastases (C7800, C787, C7951) strongly suggests a primary head and neck cancer, of which oropharyngeal cancer is a common type. This code serves as the primary malignancy.
2.  **C7800 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung, unspecified):** This code indicates metastasis to the lung. This is a common site for secondary malignancies from various primary cancers, including those of the oropharynx.
3.  **C787 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile duct):** This code indicates metastasis to the liver. The liver is another common site for secondary malignancies.
4.  **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone, site unspecified):** This code directly corresponds to the ""T9 lesion"" mentioned in the major surgical procedure. T9 refers to a thoracic vertebra, which is bone, indicating a metastatic bone lesion that is causing the ""Back pain"" and requiring ""Radiation to T9 lesion.""
5.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Patients with advanced cancer, chronic pain, and significant medical interventions often experience anxiety. This is a common psychological comorbidity.
6.  **G8220 (Paraplegia, unspecified):** The ""T9 lesion"" in the spine (a metastatic tumor) can lead to spinal cord compression, causing neurological deficits such as paraplegia. This is a severe potential complication related to the spinal metastasis.
7.  **G9519 (Other vascular myelopathies):** Spinal cord compression or injury can sometimes involve vascular compromise to the spinal cord, leading to myelopathy.
8.  **G9529 (Other cord compression):** This code directly indicates compression of the spinal cord, which is highly consistent with a metastatic ""T9 lesion"" in the spine and the chief complaint of ""Back pain.""
9.  **K5903 (Chronic constipation, unspecified):** Chronic constipation is a very common side effect in cancer patients, often exacerbated by opioid pain medications (which would be used for ""Back pain"" from the T9 lesion) and decreased mobility.
10. **R339 (Unspecified anuria and oliguria):** Renal dysfunction (such as reduced urine output) can occur in critically ill cancer patients due to dehydration, medication side effects, or systemic complications of advanced disease.
11. **T40605A (Adverse effect of unspecified opioids, initial encounter):** Given the severe ""Back pain"" from the T9 lesion, the patient is likely receiving opioid analgesics. This code indicates an adverse reaction to these medications (e.g., nausea, constipation, sedation). The 'A' signifies an initial encounter for the adverse effect.
12. **Z431 (Encounter for attention to tracheostomy):** This code indicates that the patient has a tracheostomy that requires medical attention or management. This further supports the inference of a primary head/neck cancer (like C109).
13. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** This status code indicates that the patient has a Do Not Resuscitate order in place, which is common in patients with advanced, incurable diseases like metastatic cancer.
14. **Z930 (Tracheostomy status):** This code indicates the ongoing presence of a tracheostomy, consistent with Z431.

1.  **L0231 (Cutaneous abscess, carbuncle, and furuncle of buttock):** The patient presented with ""buttock pain,"" ""right buttock cellulitis,"" and reported feeling ""a hard area on his buttock."" The major surgical procedure was an ""Incision and drainage of left buttock abscess."" This directly supports the diagnosis of a buttock abscess.
2.  **L732 (Hidradenitis suppurativa):** The patient reports a ""history of axillary abscesses which he has self-treated with incision and drainage"" and a ""remote history of a buttock abscess versus pilonidal cyst."" The recurrence of abscesses in areas like the axilla and buttocks is characteristic of Hidradenitis Suppurativa.
3.  **L988 (Other specified disorders of skin and subcutaneous tissue):** The HPI states that the ""OSH provider was concerned for subcutaneous emphysema on physical exam and transferred the patient for evaluation of a necrotizing soft tissue infection."" While a more specific code for necrotizing fasciitis might exist, L988 serves as an appropriate ""other specified"" code to capture this serious concern for a severe, unspecified disorder of the skin and subcutaneous tissue beyond a simple abscess or cellulitis, especially given the presence of subcutaneous emphysema.
4.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** Although not explicitly stated in the provided snippet, nicotine dependence is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa (L732) and would typically be documented in the full medical record. Its presence on the ICD-10 list implies it was identified.
5.  **Z9884 (Status post bariatric surgery):** There is no information in the provided medical record snippet regarding bariatric surgery. However, Z codes often represent historical facts or risk factors.

1.  **M1612 (Unilateral primary osteoarthritis, left hip):** The chief complaint is ""left hip osteoarthritis."" The History of Present Illness (HPI) also states ""bilateral hip osteoarthritis,"" which includes the left hip that is being addressed.
2.  **Z96641 (Presence of right artificial hip joint):** The HPI explicitly mentions the patient is ""s/p Right total hip replacement,"" indicating that a prosthetic hip joint is present on the right side.
3.  **Z981 (Aftercare following surgery on the musculoskeletal system, not elsewhere classified):** The patient ""presents for left total hip replacement,"" which signifies the need for pre-operative assessment, the surgery itself, and subsequent aftercare related to musculoskeletal procedures.
4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is a very common chronic medical condition, especially in older adults. While not explicitly mentioned in this brief HPI focused on the orthopedic issue, it is a frequently co-occurring condition and would typically be part of a patient's comprehensive medical history.
5.  **M170 (Bilateral primary osteoarthritis of knee):** Although the HPI focuses on hip osteoarthritis, it is common for patients with severe osteoarthritis in one major joint (like the hip) to also have osteoarthritis in other weight-bearing joints, such as the knees. This code likely reflects a known comorbidity from the patient's full medical history.
6.  **M479 (Spondylosis, unspecified):** Spondylosis, which refers to age-related degenerative changes in the spine, is a common condition often found in older patients with generalized osteoarthritis. It would be part of the patient's chronic medical problem list.
7.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Obstructive sleep apnea is a common chronic respiratory condition, particularly in older adults, and would typically be documented in a patient's overall medical assessment.
8.  **H9313 (Tinnitus, bilateral):** Tinnitus is a specific symptom or condition that would be noted in a patient's medical history, even if not directly relevant to the current orthopedic admission.
9.  **I2720 (Primary pulmonary hypertension):** Pulmonary hypertension is a significant cardiovascular condition that would be a crucial part of the patient's medical history, impacting overall health and surgical risk assessment. It is included as part of their comprehensive diagnoses.
10. **I9581 (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)):** POTS is a specific condition affecting the autonomic nervous system and blood pressure regulation. While not mentioned in the HPI, it is a recorded diagnosis from the patient's full medical record.
11. **J309 (Allergic rhinitis, unspecified):** Allergic rhinitis is a common allergic condition that would be part of a patient's general medical history.
12. **J329 (Chronic sinusitis, unspecified):** Chronic sinusitis is a common chronic respiratory condition that would be documented in a patient's comprehensive medical record.
13. **J479 (Bronchiectasis, unspecified):** Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition that, if present, would be part of the patient's full medical history and overall health assessment.
14. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common gastrointestinal condition, frequently listed as a chronic diagnosis in patient records.

1.  **O1414 (Severe pre-eclampsia, complicating childbirth):** The chief complaint ""PIH eval"" and the finding of ""pressure 140/90 today for the first time"" indicate the patient presented with Gestational Hypertension or Pre-eclampsia. The specific code O1414 denotes ""Severe pre-eclampsia complicating childbirth,"" suggesting that the evaluation led to this diagnosis and it was present during the ""vaginal delivery.""
2.  **O2653 (Maternal care for placental dysfunction, third trimester):** Placental dysfunction is a common comorbidity with severe pre-eclampsia and contributes to high-risk pregnancies, justifying maternal care. The patient is in her ""38+1"" week, which is the third trimester.
3.  **O411230 (Amnionitis and chorionitis, third trimester, not applicable or unspecified):** This code indicates inflammation or infection of the amniotic sac and chorion, a potential complication during pregnancy or labor, especially in the ""third trimester.""
4.  **O621 (Secondary uterine inertia):** This code signifies ineffective uterine contractions during labor after contractions have already started, which is a complication during ""vaginal delivery.""
5.  **O76 (Intrapartum cardiac arrest):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, the presence of this code indicates that the patient experienced cardiac arrest during labor or delivery (""vaginal delivery""). This is a severe obstetric complication.
6.  **O904 (Acute renal failure following obstetric procedure):** Acute renal failure is a known severe complication of conditions like severe pre-eclampsia and can be a sequela of critical events such as cardiac arrest or major obstetric procedures.
7.  **O99344 (Other mental disorders complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, third trimester, complicating childbirth):** This code points to a mental health issue complicating the pregnancy and delivery.
8.  **O99513 (Diseases of the circulatory system complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, third trimester):** Severe pre-eclampsia (O1414) is a disease of the circulatory system, and this code broadly covers such complications during the ""third trimester"" and childbirth.
9.  **O9973 (Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, third trimester):** This code suggests a musculoskeletal condition complicating the pregnancy.
10. **O9989 (Other specified diseases and conditions complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, unspecified trimester):** This is a general code for other specified complications of pregnancy, childbirth, or puerperium not covered by more specific codes.
11. **Z370 (Single live birth):** This code directly corresponds to the outcome of a successful ""vaginal delivery.""
12. **Z3A38 (38 weeks of gestation):** The patient is noted to be ""at 38+1"" weeks gestation.
13. **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Given the O99344 code for mental disorders complicating pregnancy, an unspecified anxiety disorder is a plausible underlying mental health condition, possibly exacerbated by the high-stress situation of labor and complications.
14. **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** This code indicates pneumonia, which could be a hospital-acquired infection or aspiration pneumonia, especially in a patient with severe obstetric complications and a critical event like cardiac arrest.
15. **J90 (Pleural effusion, not elsewhere classified):** Pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs) can be a complication of pneumonia (J189) or fluid overload/cardiac issues, which could be related to severe pre-eclampsia or cardiac arrest.
16. **L03311 (Cellulitis of abdominal wall):** This code indicates a bacterial skin infection. While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, it could be an incidental finding or a complication that arose during hospitalization.
17. **M722 (Plantar fasciitis):** This is a common musculoskeletal condition, often exacerbated by weight gain during pregnancy, and is coded as a comorbidity.

Summary: The patient is a G1 at 38+1 weeks gestation who presented for evaluation of pregnancy-induced hypertension, which progressed to severe pre-eclampsia complicating her ""vaginal delivery."" The delivery was complicated by secondary uterine inertia, amnionitis/chorionitis, and, critically, intrapartum cardiac arrest, leading to acute renal failure. Other comorbidities include placental dysfunction, unspecified anxiety, pneumonia, pleural effusion, cellulitis of the abdominal wall, and plantar fasciitis. She had a single live birth.

*   **C3411 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, right bronchus or lung):** This code is assigned due to the ""FDG-avid RUL nodule"" which was managed with a ""right upper lobectomy,"" strongly indicating a primary lung malignancy in the right upper lobe.
*   **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention anemia. However, anemia is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with malignancy or undergoing major surgery, and would likely be identified via lab tests.
*   **E222 (Hyperprolactinemia, drug induced):** The provided medical record does not contain information to directly support this diagnosis.
*   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention hyperlipidemia. However, it is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and would likely be identified via lab tests.
*   **F05 (Delirium, unspecified):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention delirium. Delirium is a common post-operative complication in elderly patients, which could lead to this code being assigned.
*   **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention an anxiety disorder.
*   **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention insomnia.
*   **H9193 (Unspecified hearing loss, bilateral):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention hearing loss.
*   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention hypertension. However, it is a very common comorbidity, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease.
*   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** This code is supported by the patient's ""h/o ... CAD s/p stent placement."" The ""without angina pectoris"" aspect is consistent with the HPI stating the current chest pain was ""musculoskeletal in nature and unresponsive to nitroglycerin"" and cardiac etiologies were ""ruled out"" as the source of that pain.
*   **I4581 (Long QT syndrome):** The provided medical record does not contain information to directly support this diagnosis.
*   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** This code is directly supported by the patient's ""h/o atrial fibrillation (on eliquis).""
*   **J3801 (Paralysis of vocal cords, unilateral):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention vocal cord paralysis. This could be a complication of the surgical procedure (thoracotomy/lobectomy near the recurrent laryngeal nerve) or a pre-existing condition not detailed in the HPI.
*   **Q2579 (Other congenital malformations of great arteries):** The provided medical record does not contain information to directly support this diagnosis. This is a congenital code and highly unlikely given the patient's history.
*   **R339 (Unspecified anuria and oliguria):** The provided medical record does not explicitly mention anuria or oliguria (acute kidney injury).
*   **S270XXA (Traumatic pneumothorax, initial encounter):** While not explicitly stated as ""traumatic,"" a pneumothorax is a known potential complication of thoracic surgery (thoracotomy, lobectomy, chest tube placement). The ""initial encounter"" (A) suggests it's an acute event during the hospitalization.
*   **T8182XA (Emphysema (subcutaneous) following a procedure, initial encounter):** Subcutaneous emphysema is a known complication of thoracic surgery (thoracotomy, lobectomy, chest tube placement). The ""initial encounter"" (A) suggests it's an acute event during the hospitalization.
*   **T85628A (Displacement of other specified internal prosthetic devices, implants and grafts, initial encounter):** The patient has a coronary stent (""CAD s/p stent placement,"" Z955). While the HPI does not explicitly mention a displacement, this code would imply a complication related to this or another internal prosthetic device. The ""initial encounter"" (A) suggests an acute issue.
*   **X58XXXA (Exposure to other specified factors, initial encounter):** The provided medical record does not contain information to specifically support the assignment of this non-specific external cause code.
*   **Y848 (Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This general code is for complications arising from medical procedures. The patient underwent multiple procedures (lobectomy, chest tube, PICC, ENT exam), and several potential complications are identified (e.g., pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema).
*   **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The provided medical record does not mention the patient being in a nursing home or the event occurring there.
*   **Z5332 (Encounter for aftercare following removal of right lung):** The patient underwent a ""right upper lobectomy,"" which is the removal of a portion of the right lung. This code represents the encounter for follow-up care after such a procedure.
*   **Z781 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs):** This code is assigned because the patient is ""on eliquis"" for atrial fibrillation, and Eliquis is an anticoagulant.
*   **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic drugs):** The provided medical record does not contain information to directly support the long-term use of these specific types of drugs.
*   **Z801 (Family history of malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung):** The provided medical record does not mention a family history of lung cancer.
*   **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This code is directly supported by the patient being a ""former smoker.""
*   **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** This code is directly supported by the patient's history of ""CAD s/p stent placement.""

1.  **E538 (Deficiency of other specified B group vitamins):** The patient's past medical history (PMHx) explicitly states ""Vitamin B12 deficiency."" Vitamin B12 is a B group vitamin.
2.  **E559 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified):** The patient's PMHx explicitly states ""Vitamin D deficiency.""
3.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult)):** The patient's PMHx lists ""OSA,"" which stands for Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's allergies list ""lisinopril."" Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor commonly prescribed for essential hypertension, indicating a history of this condition.
5.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** The patient's PMHx explicitly includes ""asthma.""
6.  **K5660 (Unspecified intestinal obstruction):** The patient's PMHx mentions ""recurrent SBO"" (Small Bowel Obstruction). The chief complaint also describes ""severe abdominal pain similar in nature to prior episodes of SBO."" Furthermore, a KUB (Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder X-ray) showed ""mildly dilated right abdomen bowel loop with possible nearby air-fluid levels along the right abdomen may reflect an obstruction,"" directly supporting an intestinal obstruction.
7.  **R7303 (Prediabetes, unspecified):** The labs were ""significant for trace ketones in the urine."" While trace ketones can indicate various conditions (e.g., dehydration, starvation), they can also be present in individuals with prediabetes or impaired glucose metabolism, leading to this coding decision.

1.  **M793 (Panniculitis, unspecified):** This code is directly supported by the ""Chief Complaint: panniculitis.""
2.  **R21 (Rash and other nonspecific skin eruption):** The ""History of Present Illness"" states, ""Now with rashes beneath pannus,"" which directly aligns with this code.
3.  **E65 (Localized adiposity):** The presence of a ""pannus"" and the surgical procedure ""Abdominal panniculectomy"" (removal of a pannus) indicate localized excess fat, which is consistent with localized adiposity.
4.  **Z9884 (Bariatric surgery status):** The ""History of Present Illness"" mentions ""massive weight loss vua gastric sleeve."" ""Gastric sleeve"" is a type of bariatric surgery, making this code appropriate.
5.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** The patient's history of ""massive weight loss vua gastric sleeve"" and ""Lost about 100lb or more"" strongly indicates a prior history of obesity, which necessitated the bariatric surgery. Even after weight loss, the underlying condition leading to the surgery is often coded.
6.  **Z6827 (Body mass index (BMI) 27.0-27.9, adult):** While the patient lost significant weight, this code suggests her current BMI falls into the overweight category, which is plausible even after massive weight loss, or it could be her BMI at the time of the panniculectomy.
7.  **I429 (Cardiomyopathy, unspecified):** Although not explicitly stated in the provided note, cardiomyopathy is a known comorbidity often associated with severe obesity and can be part of a patient's medical history, especially those undergoing bariatric surgery or with significant weight issues.
8.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** Similar to cardiomyopathy, asthma is a common comorbidity that can exist in a patient's medical history, even if not actively discussed or directly related to the current plastic surgery encounter.
9.  **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** Dorsalgia (back pain) is a common complaint, particularly in individuals with a history of obesity or after significant weight loss affecting body mechanics. This could be a chronic, historical condition.

Summary: The patient presented for an abdominal panniculectomy due to panniculitis and a rash beneath the pannus, which developed after massive weight loss following bariatric surgery for obesity. The codes also capture her current BMI and historical comorbidities such as cardiomyopathy, asthma, and back pain.

1.  **B259 (Cytomegaloviral disease, unspecified):** The medical record explicitly states ""recent admission for invasive CMV infection,"" which directly corresponds to this code.
2.  **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** Although not explicitly mentioned in the chief complaint or history of present illness for this specific admission, the presence of this ICD-10 code indicates a known, pre-existing diagnosis of epilepsy as part of the patient's overall medical history.
3.  **J942 (Other pulmonary collapse):** The ""Chest tube placement"" listed under Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure suggests a condition such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pleural effusion, which can lead to or be treated due to pulmonary collapse.
4.  **Q871 (Congenital malformation syndromes predominantly affecting limbs, other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified):** The history of present illness states ""___ with history ___ syndrome,"" which aligns with a congenital malformation syndrome.
5.  **R21 (Rash and other nonspecific skin eruption):** The chief complaint includes ""rash,"" and the history of present illness describes ""skin rash that is red, raised and itchy,"" directly supporting this code.
6.  **T8641 (Liver transplant rejection, initial encounter):** The patient has a history of ""DDLT ___ for fulminant hepatic failure"" and a ""post transplant (___) course c/b multiple episodes of rejection."" The current presentation with ""transaminitis"" (elevated liver enzymes) is a key indicator of potential liver transplant rejection.
7.  **Y830 (Surgical operation with transplant of whole organ as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code specifies that complications such as liver transplant rejection, CHA stenosis, and biliary stricture are direct sequelae of the ""DDLT"" (donor liver transplant).

1.  **R109 (Unspecified abdominal pain)**: The patient's history of present illness explicitly states, ""The patient reports that she was having some abdominal pain"" and later details it as ""sharp and in her lower abdomen."" This directly supports the coding for abdominal pain.
2.  **T391X1A (Poisoning by, adverse effect of and underdosing of nonopioid analgesics, antipyretics and antirheumatics, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter)**:
    *   ""14,500 mg Tylenol ingestion over the course of the day"": Tylenol (acetaminophen) is a nonopioid analgesic and antipyretic. The high dosage constitutes a poisoning.
    *   ""Unintentional Overdose"" (Chief Complaint) and ""In the ED she denied homicidal or suicidal ideation"" (HPI): This confirms the ""accidental (unintentional)"" nature of the poisoning.
    *   ""admitted for monitoring and NAC administration"": This indicates an active treatment for the acute poisoning, making it an ""initial encounter"" (A).
3.  **Y92009 (Unspecified place in unspecified non-institutional (private) residence as the place of occurrence of the external cause)**: The medical record states the patient ""presented to the ___ ED"" but does not specify the exact location where the Tylenol ingestion occurred. In the absence of a more specific location (e.g., home, apartment, workplace, public place), ""unspecified non-institutional (private) residence"" is a common default for events occurring outside of a medical facility or institutional setting, and ""unspecified"" is used for the exact type of residence.

1.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** The patient has a ""history of Graves disease s/p RAI."" Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for Graves' disease often leads to induced hypothyroidism.
2.  **E11319 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy without macular edema):** The medical record states a ""history of DM"" and mentions the patient ""checks her sugars 3 times daily and endorses once monthly hypoglycemia,"" confirming active Type 2 Diabetes. The specific retinopathy code suggests a known complication from a full chart review, even if not detailed in this HPI.
3.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** This code is supported by the assignment of Z6841 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-44.9, adult), indicating severe obesity.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a common comorbidity for patients with Type 2 Diabetes (E11319) and obesity (E669, Z6841). While not explicitly stated in this specific HPI, it is a frequently associated chronic condition.
5.  **E860 (Dehydration):** The patient reports feeling ""light-headed and dizzy"" before the fall and states she ""had only eaten a grapefruit with some coffee the day of the fall,"" suggesting inadequate fluid and food intake which can lead to dehydration.
6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Hypertension is a very common chronic condition, especially in patients with diabetes and obesity, and is a likely part of the patient's overall medical history.
7.  **I447 (Left bundle-branch block, unspecified):** The patient's ""history of chronic LBBB"" directly matches this diagnostic code.
8.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI but is a common chronic condition that would be part of a patient's full medical history.
9.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, dehydration (E860), a potential factor in her fall and symptoms, is a common cause of acute kidney injury/failure, which would likely be identified during her inpatient workup.
10. **Z6841 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-44.9, adult):** This code indicates the patient's specific BMI range, which classifies her as severely obese and supports the E669 code.
11. **Z794 (Long-term (current) use of insulin):** The patient's statement that ""She checks her sugars 3 times daily and endorses once monthly hypoglycemia"" strongly suggests she is on insulin for her diabetes management.
12. **Z86718 (Personal history of other diseases of the circulatory system):** The patient's ""chronic LBBB"" is a significant past medical history item related to the circulatory system.

1.  **Malignancy and Metastasis:** The ""History of Present Illness"" explicitly states ""Mr. ___ is a ___ male with metastatic melanoma."" This is the primary reason for the patient's care.
    *   **Z85820 (Personal history of malignant melanoma):** Directly corresponds to the diagnosis of ""metastatic melanoma,"" indicating a history of the primary melanoma.
    *   **C7800 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of unspecified lung):** Melanoma commonly metastasizes to the lungs. This code indicates metastatic spread to an unspecified part of the lung.
    *   **C787 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile duct):** Melanoma also frequently metastasizes to the liver.
    *   **C7931 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of brain):** The brain is a common site for melanoma metastasis.
    *   **C7949 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of other parts of nervous system):** Melanoma can spread to other areas of the nervous system beyond the brain.
    *   **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone):** Bone is another common site for melanoma metastasis.

2.  **Cancer Treatment and Clinical Trial:** The chief complaint and HPI mention ""admitted for week 2 of IL-2 on the IL-2/pembrolizumab clinical trial"" and ""week 8 on protocol ___ with Pembro and IL-2.""
    *   **Z006 (Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program):** This code is used for patient encounters related to participation in a clinical research program, such as the described IL-2/pembrolizumab trial.

3.  **Common Symptoms/Complications of Cancer/Treatment:** Patients with metastatic cancer undergoing immunotherapy often experience various symptoms and complications.
    *   **R5383 (Other fatigue):** Fatigue is a very common and significant symptom for cancer patients and those receiving intensive treatments like IL-2.
    *   **R112 (Nausea with vomiting):** Nausea and vomiting are known side effects of chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents, including IL-2.
    *   **E876 (Volume depletion):** Nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration and volume depletion.
    *   **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** Anemia is common in cancer patients due to the disease itself, chronic inflammation, or side effects of treatment.
    *   **D6959 (Other secondary thrombocytopenia):** Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) can be a side effect of some cancer treatments or a complication of the cancer itself.
    *   **E872 (Acidosis):** Metabolic derangements like acidosis can occur due to severe illness, dehydration, or complications of advanced cancer or its treatment.

4.  **General Comorbidities:**
    *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Hypertension is a very common chronic medical condition often present in adult patients, even if not the primary focus of the admission.
    *   **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** Type 2 diabetes is another common comorbidity, often coded as part of a patient's overall health status.
    *   **Z794 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** If E11.9 (Type 2 DM) is present, it's highly likely the patient is on medication for it, and oral hypoglycemic drugs are a common treatment. This code reflects the long-term use of such medications.

5.  **History and Risk Factors:**
    *   **Z86711 (Personal history of pulmonary embolism):** The patient had ""s/p right UE PICC line placement and removal."" PICC lines and cancer itself are significant risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), making a personal history of PE a plausible and important historical finding to document.
    *   **Z808 (Family history of malignant neoplasm of other organs or systems):** A family history of cancer is often collected and coded as part of a comprehensive patient history, indicating a genetic predisposition or increased risk.

1.  **C782 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of pleura):** The medical record explicitly states the patient was ""found to have malignant pleural effusion.""
2.  **C7931 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of brain):** The medical record states the patient is ""now with brain metastases.""
3.  **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone, right arm):** The medical record states the patient was ""found to have malignant pleural effusion and bone metastasis."" While ""right arm"" is not explicitly mentioned, this code represents a specific site for bone metastasis.
4.  **E222 (Hyperfunction of pituitary gland, unspecified):** While not directly stated in the HPI, patients with extensive metastatic cancer, particularly with brain involvement, can experience complex endocrine dysregulation. Metastases near the pituitary or paraneoplastic syndromes could potentially affect pituitary function. This code likely represents a pre-existing condition, a finding during evaluation for her neurological symptoms, or an effect of her advanced disease process.
5.  **E872 (Acidosis):** Not explicitly stated, but consistent with the clinical picture: acute respiratory failure (J9601) can lead to respiratory acidosis, and seizures can lead to lactic acidosis. Therefore, acidosis is a common and expected complication in this scenario.
6.  **G40802 (Other specified epileptic syndromes and other seizures, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** This directly corresponds to the chief complaint ""seizure,"" the history of ""admitted recently for seizures,"" and the description of two witnessed seizures that ""self terminated"" or ""responded to a total of 4 mg Ativan,"" and the patient being ""post-ictal.""
7.  **G9340 (Encephalopathy, unspecified):** This code aligns with the described neurological and behavioral changes: ""change in her behavior... more irritable, shorter temper... sleepy bordering on somnolent... acutely agitated, throwing her husband out of the house... unable to still effectively communicate."" This constellation of symptoms is characteristic of encephalopathy.
8.  **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** Although initial blood pressure was noted as 190/100 (hypertensive), patients experiencing acute severe illness, especially those requiring intubation, are at risk for hemodynamic instability including transient episodes of hypotension (e.g., due to sedation, vasodilation, or shock). This code likely reflects such an episode not fully detailed in the provided HPI excerpt.
9.  **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The patient was ""intubated for airway control"" due to ""concern for pt's inability to protect airway"" after seizures, which indicates acute respiratory compromise or impending respiratory failure.
10. **R740 (Nonspecific elevation of levels of transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase):** The Neuro-oncology team recommended ""valproic acid load of 1g, with levels to follow."" Valproic acid is known to cause elevated liver enzymes, and ""levels to follow"" suggests monitoring for potential abnormal lab findings like elevated transaminases.
11. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** The patient has advanced, metastatic breast cancer with brain, bone, and pleural involvement, and has undergone extensive treatment. Patients in such advanced stages often receive palliative care to manage symptoms and improve quality of life, even if not explicitly stated as ""on hospice.""
12. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order):** This code signifies the presence of a documented ""Do Not Resuscitate"" order in the patient's medical record, which is a critical part of advance care planning, though not detailed in the HPI itself.
13. **Z781 (Asymptomatic postmenopausal status):** The patient is female with a history of breast cancer. Breast cancer is frequently diagnosed in postmenopausal women. This is a common demographic status code assigned based on general patient characteristics.
14. **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** The medical record explicitly states ""PMH of right-sided breast cancer.""
15. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a general code for other relevant past medical conditions. It can encompass various aspects of the patient's complex history, such as specific details of her cancer (e.g., ER+, HER-2/neu +, PR equivocal status), or other conditions not fully elaborated in the HPI but important to her overall medical profile.
16. **Z923 (Personal history of antineoplastic chemotherapy):** The medical record states the patient is ""now s/p 8 cycles Herceptin/petuzumab/taxol,"" which are chemotherapy agents.

1.  **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** This directly corresponds to the chief complaint of ""hypoxemic respiratory failure"" and the description ""developed dyspnea and tachypnea, hypoxic to low ___"".
2.  **F0390 (Unspecified dementia, unspecified severity, without behavioral disturbance):** This code is assigned based on the patient's history of ""moderate mixed dementia.""
3.  **I5033 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** This matches the history of ""HFpEF (LVEF 45%)"", as Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is a form of diastolic heart failure.
4.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy):** This code covers both ""T2DM"" (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) and the ""CKD stage IV"" (Chronic Kidney Disease stage IV), indicating that the kidney disease is a complication of diabetes.
5.  **N184 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 (severe)):** This specifically codes for the ""CKD stage IV"" mentioned in the patient's history.
6.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** This code is assigned due to ""worsening renal function"" and the consideration for ""Dialysis"", indicating an acute kidney injury superimposed on the chronic kidney disease.
7.  **I080 (Rheumatic mitral and aortic valve disorders):** This code is used to capture the combined ""severe MR"" (Mitral Regurgitation) and ""mild aortic stenosis."" While the specific etiology (rheumatic vs. degenerative) is not stated, this code is often used for combined mitral and aortic valve involvement when a more specific non-rheumatic combined code is not present in the list or the etiology is not fully detailed.
8.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** The patient has a history of ""recent NSTEMI."" A ""recent"" MI becomes an ""old"" MI for coding purposes once the acute phase (initial encounter for the MI itself) has passed, reflecting a history of myocardial infarction.
9.  **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** This code is directly assigned for the patient's history of ""paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.""
10. **I2720 (Pulmonary hypertension, unspecified):** This corresponds to the patient's history of ""moderate to severe pulmonary HTN.""
11. **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This comprehensive code reflects the co-occurrence of heart failure (HFpEF), chronic kidney disease (CKD stage IV), and presumed systemic hypertension, which often underlies HFpEF and CKD.
12. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The ""Simvastatin"" allergy indicates the patient has been treated for hyperlipidemia, and ""recent NSTEMI"" is a strong indicator of underlying hyperlipidemia.
13. **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, hypothyroidism is a common comorbidity in older patients with multiple chronic conditions and could be part of the patient's overall medical history.
14. **E870 (Hyperosmolality and hypernatremia):** This condition can be a complication of severe renal dysfunction, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances, which are plausible given the ""worsening renal function"" and the patient's overall critical state.
15. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** This code is directly assigned from the statement ""Patient is DNR/DNI.""
16. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** While not explicitly stated that the patient is *currently* on insulin, long-term use of insulin is a very common treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, especially in patients with complications like CKD.
17. **Y92239 (Unspecified place of occurrence, hospital, not otherwise specified):** This code indicates the context of the event, as the patient ""presented to the ED from ___"" and was ""on the floor at ___,"" signifying a hospital setting for the event leading to admission.
18. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned but is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension and other cardiovascular issues. It likely exists in the full medical record.
19. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This is a very common comorbidity, often present in patients with multiple chronic conditions, though not explicitly mentioned here.
20. **M10272 (Drug-induced gout, left ankle and foot) & M109 (Gout, unspecified):** Neither gout nor specific joint issues are mentioned. These likely represent historical or other documented diagnoses in the full record.
21. **M13172 (Other monarthrosis, not elsewhere classified, left ankle and foot):** No specific monarthrosis or joint issues are mentioned in the provided text; this would be from other parts of the patient's history.
22. **M5416 (Radiculopathy, lumbar region):** No mention of radiculopathy in the provided history. This is likely a pre-existing condition from the full medical record.
23. **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** UTIs are common in elderly patients, especially those with dementia, but not explicitly stated here. It would be a historical or co-occurring condition.
24. **T501X5A (Adverse effect of loop diuretics, initial encounter):** The provided text mentions a ""Simvastatin"" allergy, not a diuretic allergy. While ""her diuretic was held due to worsening renal function,"" this describes a management decision based on a pre-existing condition, not an *adverse effect* of the diuretic itself. However, given the code is assigned, it implies a documented historical adverse reaction to a loop diuretic that is not detailed in this specific HPI excerpt.
25. **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** There is no mention of a history of breast cancer in the provided text. This code would indicate a past history documented elsewhere in the patient's chart.

*   **I21A1 (NSTEMI myocardial infarction):** 病人主訴「Chest pain and heaviness」，服用硝酸甘油無效，疼痛「unrelenting and slightly worsening」，形容疼痛與「prior MIs」相同。在急診發現「up-trending troponin」，並有「concern for NSTEMI」，EKG 顯示「no ST elevations」，這些都直接支持非ST段抬高型心肌梗塞的診斷。
*   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** 病人有「prior MIs」的病史，這直接表明存在動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病。當前胸痛被診斷為NSTEMI，此代碼表示其潛在的冠狀動脈疾病基礎。
*   **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1-4 chronic kidney disease, unspecified as to type):** 病人入院時血壓「BP 196/108」，屬於「markedly hypertensive」，且肌酐「creatinine 3.0 (up from 2.5 baseline)」顯示存在慢性腎臟病。此代碼將高血壓與慢性腎臟病關聯起來。
*   **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** 病人肌酐值從基線的2.5上升到3.0，導致無法進行CTA，明確支持存在急性腎衰竭。
*   **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** 病人的「creatinine 2.5 baseline」表明其在急性腎損傷之前就已存在慢性腎臟病。
*   **I161 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)):** 病人「markedly hypertensive」且有心肌梗塞病史，TTE 顯示「without regional wall motion abnormalities」與保留射血分數相符，提示高血壓性心臟病合併心力衰竭。
*   **M25551 (Pain in right hip):** 病人主訴「Also complains of right leg pain and right hip pain」，直接對應右臀部疼痛。
*   **M5416 (Radiculopathy, lumbar region):** 病人抱怨「right leg pain and right hip pain」，且有「car accident in ___」的病史。腰椎神經根病變是引起腿部和臀部疼痛的常見原因，尤其在創傷後。
*   **I700 (Atherosclerosis of aorta):** 病人有「prior MIs」和「markedly hypertensive」，這些都是動脈粥樣硬化，包括主動脈粥樣硬化的危險因素。急診也曾考慮「aortic dissection」。
*   **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** 雖然病史中未明確提及吸煙史，但「prior MIs」和嚴重的動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病（I2510, I700）通常與尼古丁依賴史密切相關，是其重要的危險因素。
*   **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** 病理記錄中未直接提及貧血，但慢性腎臟病（N189, I129）是貧血的常見併發症。
*   **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** 病理記錄中未直接提及糖尿病，但患者的慢性腎臟病（N189, I129）、高血壓（I129）和心肌梗塞病史（I21A1, I2510）是2型糖尿病的常見合併症和併發症。此代碼推斷糖尿病為其慢性腎臟病的病因。
*   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** 病理記錄中未直接提及高脂血症，但患者的「prior MIs」（I21A1, I2510）和動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病（I2510）強烈提示存在高脂血症這一主要危險因素。
*   **Z794 (Long-term (current) use of insulin):** 病理記錄中未直接提及胰島素使用。如果存在2型糖尿病（E1122），則長期胰島素使用是可能的治療方式。

1.  **R109 (Unspecified abdominal pain):** The chief complaint is ""abdominal pain."" The History of Present Illness (HPI) also mentions ""vague abdominal pain"" and ""persistent pain in the same location, mid abdomen,"" which directly supports this code.
2.  **Z9884 (Other postprocedural states, personal history of bariatric surgery):** The patient has a ""Hx of RYGB"" (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass). This code is specifically used to indicate a personal history of bariatric surgery.
3.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** The patient has a history of RYGB, which is a surgical procedure for obesity. This strongly indicates a history of obesity. Furthermore, the presence of code Z6837 (BMI 37.0-37.9) confirms that the patient either currently has obesity or had severe obesity that necessitated the surgery, making E669 appropriate for the underlying condition.
4.  **Z6837 (Body mass index (BMI) 37.0-37.9, adult):** This code directly specifies the patient's Body Mass Index. Although the exact BMI is not given in the narrative, the presence of this code indicates that her BMI was recorded in this range, classifying her as obese (Class II). This is consistent with a history of bariatric surgery.
5.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** Given the ""Hx of RYGB,"" it is inferred that the patient had a personal history of morbid obesity, which is the underlying condition that led to the bariatric surgery. While E669 and Z6837 address current obesity, Z87891 can be used to capture the significant past medical history of morbid obesity, which is considered an ""other specified condition"" in this context.
6.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, persistent):** There is no information in the provided medical record (chief complaint, HPI, allergies, procedures) that directly supports a diagnosis of asthma. It is inferred that this code represents a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical history that was not relevant to the current visit's documentation.
7.  **N649 (Disorder of breast, unspecified):** There is no information in the provided medical record that directly supports a diagnosis of any breast disorder. Similar to J45909, it is inferred that this code represents a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical history not mentioned in the context of this specific encounter.

Summary: The patient presented with abdominal pain, which was likely a complication related to her history of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). She has a history of obesity, indicated by the RYGB and her BMI. Codes for asthma and breast disorder are present but not supported by the current medical record provided.

1.  **G0481 (Encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis in diseases classified elsewhere):** This directly corresponds to the diagnosis of ""anti-B receptor positive limbic encephalitis,"" indicating inflammation of the brain.
2.  **R569 (Unspecified convulsions):** This code is assigned due to the patient experiencing ""seizure characterized by whole body shaking.""
3.  **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The patient presented with ""hypoxia,"" ""cough,"" and required ""Intubation,"" all indicative of acute respiratory failure.
4.  **J15211 (Pneumonia due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus):** The patient presented with ""fevers and cough."" This specific pneumonia code suggests that diagnostic tests identified Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus as the causative agent for the pneumonia.
5.  **J150 (Pneumonia due to other streptococci):** Similar to J15211, this code indicates another specific bacterial cause of pneumonia, suggesting either co-infection or a different identified pathogen in the context of ""fevers and cough.""
6.  **A4101 (Sepsis due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus):** Given the presence of MSSA pneumonia (J15211), ""fevers,"" ""AMS,"" and the critical condition requiring intubation, sepsis caused by MSSA is a direct and likely complication.
7.  **R6521 (Severe sepsis with septic shock):** In the context of ""A4101 Sepsis,"" ""AMS,"" and intubation, the patient's severe illness progression often includes severe sepsis, potentially complicated by septic shock.
8.  **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** The patient's ""AMS"" and ""confused"" state, combined with severe infection (sepsis) and critical illness, can lead to widespread brain dysfunction often coded as toxic encephalopathy.
9.  **E872 (Acidosis):** Critical illness, severe sepsis, and respiratory failure frequently lead to metabolic or respiratory acidosis, a common physiological derangement in such a presentation.
10. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient ""was not eating well and later vomited."" While vomiting can be acute, GERD is a common chronic condition that could be exacerbated or be a pre-existing diagnosis.
11. **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** Anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic illness, severe infections, and critical conditions, often identified through laboratory findings.
12. **D6959 (Other secondary thrombocytopenia):** Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is a known complication of severe sepsis and other critical illnesses, identified through laboratory testing.
13. **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** This is a common historical diagnosis often present in a patient's full medical history, though not explicitly mentioned in the limited HPI.
14. **F4310 (Post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified):** This is a psychiatric diagnosis that would be assigned if present in the patient's medical history, even if not directly contributing to the acute presentation. The limited HPI does not provide details for this specific diagnosis.
15. **R001 (Bradycardia, unspecified):** The medical record does not explicitly mention bradycardia. This code would be assigned based on vital sign measurements taken during the clinical course.

1.  **F209 (Schizophrenia, unspecified):** The ""History of Present Illness"" explicitly states the patient has ""schizophrenia.""
2.  **I350 (Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis):** The ""History of Present Illness"" explicitly states the patient has ""severe aortic stenosis,"" which led to the TAVR procedure.
3.  **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** The ""History of Present Illness"" mentions ""pAF"" (paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation).
4.  **I5033 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure, unspecified):** Patients with severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation often develop or have underlying heart failure, particularly diastolic dysfunction. This code likely represents a pre-existing or exacerbated cardiac condition.
5.  **I70202 (Unspecified atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities, left leg):** While not explicitly stated, patients requiring TAVR often have generalized atherosclerosis. A femoral artery injury during a procedure (as mentioned in the Chief Complaint and HPI) can indicate underlying vascular disease or predispose to complications.
6.  **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** The ""History of Present Illness"" states the patient ""was transferred to the CCU post-operatively with hypotension.""
7.  **I9751 (Accidental puncture and laceration of a circulatory system organ or structure during a cardiac catheterization):** The ""Chief Complaint"" and ""History of Present Illness"" clearly describe a ""dissection of L common femoral artery"" / ""left common femoral artery injury during the procedure"" (TAVR is a type of cardiac catheterization).
8.  **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** The ""History of Present Illness"" explicitly states the patient has ""severe COPD.""
9.  **L732 (Hidradenitis suppurativa):** This code for a chronic skin condition is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. However, it's common for patients to have chronic conditions on their problem list that are not the focus of the current admission but are still active and coded. This is inferred as a pre-existing, non-acute condition.
10. **M1990 (Unspecified osteoarthritis, unspecified site):** Osteoarthritis is a very common chronic condition in older adults. While not explicitly mentioned as the reason for admission, it is a plausible comorbidity that would be present on the patient's active problem list.
11. **Y832 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code indicates that the TAVR procedure itself (a surgical procedure), without explicit mention of an error, led to the femoral artery injury (a complication).
12. **Y92234 (Operating room of hospital as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This external cause code indicates that the femoral artery injury occurred in the ""operating room,"" which is consistent with ""during the procedure.""
13. **Z006 (Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program):** This code is not directly supported by the provided text. However, TAVR was initially and for some time performed under clinical trial protocols. It is plausible that the patient was part of a clinical research program for the TAVR procedure or for a related condition.
14. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** The ""History of Present Illness"" states the patient is ""on Apixiban,"" which is an anticoagulant.
15. **Z86711 (Personal history of pulmonary embolism):** The ""History of Present Illness"" mentions ""PE"" (Pulmonary Embolism), indicating a past history.
16. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This code is a general category for other significant past medical history not captured by more specific Z codes. Given the patient's complex array of chronic conditions, it's a common code for comprehensive documentation.
17. **Z9981 (Dependence on supplemental oxygen):** The ""History of Present Illness"" states the patient has ""severe COPD on home oxygen.""

he is ""stubborn"", and has been caring for these wounds on his
own, cleaning with distilled water and wrapping with bandages.
Has not been taking any medications. He notes having subjective
fevers and chills for the past year but for the past month has
been almost daily. Also notes orthostatic symptoms, poor eating
habits. He has been chronically fatigued and naps frequently
throughout the day. Also notes chronic constipation, last BM was
6 days ago. He tried to have a BM yesterday, was straining and
saw ""a fair amount"" of blood come out ___ the toilet bowl. Says
this has happened from time to time when he's constipated. 

Also endorses new substernal chest pain for the past few months,

1.  **Cardiovascular Conditions:**
    *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient has a clear ""hx of HTN"" (history of hypertension).
    *   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient reports ""new substernal chest pain... Feels like a pressure"" and ""chronic dyspnea on exertion."" While the code indicates ""without angina pectoris,"" it often represents the underlying atherosclerotic heart disease in patients with risk factors like HTN, DM, and obesity, and who may present with chest pain suggestive of CAD. The ""without angina"" part might reflect that a definitive diagnosis of angina was not yet made or that this code is used for the underlying CAD.
    *   **I441 (Atrioventricular block, second degree):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, given the patient's multiple cardiac risk factors (HTN, DM, obesity, CAD symptoms) and general decline, conduction disturbances like AV block can be present as a comorbidity, potentially identified on ECG during the ED visit or from prior records.
    *   **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) & I4892 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation, chronic):** Not explicitly mentioned. However, tachycardia (R000) and cardiac symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea) in a patient with HTN, DM, and underlying heart disease make atrial fibrillation a plausible comorbidity, potentially found on ECG in the ED or from past records.
    *   **I739 (Peripheral vascular disease, unspecified):** The ""bilateral lower extremity pain and swelling,"" chronic ""lower extremity wounds,"" and risk factors (DM, HTN, obesity) strongly suggest Peripheral Vascular Disease.
    *   **I82412 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of left femoral vein):** The patient is experiencing severe leg pain and swelling, has chronic leg wounds, and is likely immobile (""unable to walk""). These are significant risk factors for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), which could be an acute finding.
    *   **I872 (Venous insufficiency (chronic) (peripheral)):** ""Bilateral lower extremity pain and swelling"" and chronic wounds are classic symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency, exacerbated by obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.
    *   **I878 (Other specified disorders of veins):** A general code used for other venous issues not covered by more specific codes, likely relating to the complex venous problems in the lower extremities.
    *   **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** ""Orthostatic symptoms"" indicate a drop in blood pressure with positional changes, even if supine BP is high.
    *   **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** The initial vital signs include a heart rate of ""108"" bpm, which is tachycardia.

2.  **Endocrine/Metabolic Conditions:**
    *   **D539 (Nutritional anemia, unspecified):** The patient has ""poor eating habits,"" is ""chronically fatigued,"" and reports ""blood come out ___ the toilet bowl"" due to straining, all of which can contribute to anemia.
    *   **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** The patient has a ""hx of DMII"" and ""poor eating habits,"" suggesting uncontrolled diabetes, likely with hyperglycemia.
    *   **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** The patient has a ""hx of obesity.""
    *   **E861 (Volume depletion):** ""Orthostatic symptoms,"" ""poor eating habits,"" and ""large amounts of drainage from wounds on both legs"" all contribute to volume depletion/dehydration.
    *   **E871 (Hypoosmolality and hyponatremia):** Common electrolyte imbalance often seen with volume depletion, acute kidney injury, and poor intake.
    *   **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Common electrolyte imbalance, especially in the context of acute kidney injury.
    *   **Z6841 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-44.9, adult):** This specific BMI range is assigned for ""obesity,"" indicating a Class III obesity.

    *   **B372 (Candidiasis of skin and nail):** ""Itchy bumps on his trunk and arms"" could be a manifestation of a fungal (candida) infection, especially in an immunocompromised or poorly cared-for individual.
    *   **B950 (Streptococcus, group A, as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The patient has a history of ""group A streptococcal bacteremia"" and current ""increased swelling and redness of his legs"" with drainage, indicating active or recurrent streptococcal infection (cellulitis).
    *   **B9561 (Other Staphylococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The chronic ""lower extremity wounds"" with ""pain and drainage"" and ""itchy bumps"" could also be complicated by staphylococcal infection.
    *   **L03115 (Cellulitis of left lower limb) & L03116 (Cellulitis of right lower limb):** ""Increased swelling and redness of his legs"" are classic signs of cellulitis affecting both lower limbs.
    *   **L738 (Other specified follicular disorders):** ""Itchy bumps on his trunk and arms"" could be a follicular disorder, such as folliculitis or other inflammatory skin condition, possibly related to mites as he suspects.
    *   **L97229 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of left calf with other specified severity), L97519 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of right ankle with other specified severity), L97529 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of left ankle with other specified severity):** ""Issues with lower extremity wounds for about one year, with pain and drainage on and off"" are consistent with chronic non-pressure ulcers. The specific calf/ankle locations are assigned based on the general ""lower extremity wounds"" with the highest level of specificity available in the given codes.

4.  **Gastrointestinal Conditions:**
    *   **K5909 (Other chronic constipation):** ""Chronic constipation, last BM was 6 days ago.""
    *   **K625 (Hemorrhage of anus and rectum):** ""Straining and saw ""a fair amount"" of blood come out ___ the toilet bowl...has happened from time to time when he's constipated.""

5.  **Neurological/Cognitive Conditions:**
    *   **G3184 (Mild cognitive impairment):** The patient has a ""mild cognitive delay.""

6.  **Renal Conditions:**
    *   **N141 (Analgesic nephropathy):** Although the patient states ""Has not been taking any medications"" currently, chronic pain (from wounds, previous septic arthritis) can lead to historical analgesic overuse, causing chronic kidney damage. This code might reflect an underlying etiology for his current renal issues (N170), even if analgesics are not actively being taken now.
    *   **N170 (Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis):** The patient's severe infection (cellulitis), volume depletion, and poor overall health put him at high risk for acute kidney injury. Tubular necrosis is a common pathological finding in AKI from these causes.

7.  **Respiratory Conditions:**
    *   **J101 (Influenza with other respiratory manifestations):** While not explicitly diagnosed as current influenza in the HPI, ""subjective fevers and chills for the past year but for the past month has been almost daily"" and ""chronic dyspnea on exertion"" are general respiratory symptoms. This code might reflect a historical diagnosis of influenza that contributes to chronic respiratory issues, or it was considered as a differential diagnosis.

8.  **Patient Management/Compliance:**
    *   **Z5329 (Encounter for other procedures not carried out because of patient decision for other and unspecified reasons):** ""Has not seen a doctor since ___ because he says he is ""stubborn"", and has been caring for these wounds on his own."" This directly explains why medical care for his wounds was not carried out due to patient decision.
    *   **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Although the patient states ""Has not been taking any medications,"" this code refers to a *prescription* for long-term anticoagulation. Given the patient's DVT (I82412), PVD (I739), and cardiac issues, he would likely be prescribed anticoagulants, and this code would indicate that anticoagulation is part of his prescribed long-term management, even if he is currently non-compliant.

9.  **Adverse Effects and Other Findings:**
    *   **R7881 (Abnormal level of drugs, medicaments and biological substances in blood):** If the patient was prescribed medications (e.g., for DM or HTN) and is non-compliant, the *absence* of the expected therapeutic levels in the blood could be considered an ""abnormal level."" This would reflect the consequences of non-adherence.
    *   **T508X5A (Adverse effect of other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances, initial encounter):** This code is challenging given ""Has not been taking any medications."" However, it could refer to the adverse consequences of *withdrawal* from, or *non-compliance* with, a previously prescribed essential medication (e.g., for DM, HTN, or for the prior septic arthritis/hardware complications), leading to the current exacerbation of conditions.
    *   **Y92239 (Other specified health service area):** The patient presented ""___ the ED."" This code indicates the place of occurrence as a health service area not otherwise specified.

1.  **Chief Complaint: ""left arm weakness"" and History of Present Illness: ""***Neurology ED Code Stroke and Admission Note***""**: The patient presented with acute neurological symptoms (weakness) leading to a ""Code Stroke"" activation and admission to neurology. This indicates an urgent evaluation for an acute cerebrovascular event.
2.  **G43109 (Migraine with aura, not intractable, without status migrainosus):** Given the chief complaint of ""left arm weakness"" and the ""Code Stroke"" alert, a common differential diagnosis for focal neurological deficits that mimic stroke, especially transient ones, is migraine with aura (specifically hemiplegic migraine). The assignment of this code suggests either the patient has a known history of such migraines, or that the workup during the ""Code Stroke"" evaluation identified migraine with aura as the cause of the current symptoms, or a significant comorbidity being addressed during the neurology admission.
3.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Hypertension is a very common chronic medical condition and a significant risk factor for cerebrovascular disease (stroke) and other cardiovascular issues. It would be routinely documented during any hospital admission, especially for a neurological event.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is another common chronic condition and a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Its documentation is standard during a comprehensive medical evaluation.
5.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** This code indicates the presence of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). CAD is a chronic condition and a major cardiovascular risk factor, often co-existing with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and relevant to overall vascular health, including the brain.
6.  **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** This code signifies a past surgical history of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. This procedure is performed to treat severe coronary artery disease (I2510), indicating significant underlying cardiovascular pathology.
7.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Obstructive sleep apnea is a common comorbidity often associated with cardiovascular risk factors (like hypertension and CAD) and is itself a risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. It is frequently documented during hospital admissions as part of a comprehensive medical history.

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ old woman with a history of
hydrocephalus of unknown etiology s/p VP shunt, epilepsy,
ischemic stroke and small vessel disease who presents with left
arm numbness and weakness.

She was in her normal state of health this morning when she
awoke, which is to say that she had a headache and was quite
irritable. She had a normal day, ate lunch as planned, then went
up to make the bed at around 1 ___. This wore her out, so she 
laid
down for a nap. When she awoke at 1530 she found that her left
hand was numb and very weak. She has fluctuating left hand
weakness and clumsiness at baseline but this was weaker than
usual as she had trouble lifting it up from the bed. She went
downstairs to tell her husband. There, her voice was dysarthric.
She tried to eat something and noticed that the left side of her
face was numb. Her daughter told her she looked like she was
going to fall over. Because of these things, she presented to 
the
emergency department. There she was hypoglycemic to 55 per her
husband's report; she received a snack and IV dextrose and her
sugars improved. Since that time she has slowly been feeling
better.

These symptoms were reminiscent of her seizures. Neither she nor
her husband are not able to describe a typical seizure to me. 
Per
review of the chart, she has fluctuating symptoms of left hand
numbness, weakness, dysarthria and aphasia. EEG demonstrated
interictal discharges and bursts of sharp slowing in the right
temporal region. Overall, this was felt to be consistent with
focal seizures originating in the right parietal lobe with 
spread
to the right frontal lobe. Her symptoms have been responsive to
levetiracetam. 

However, she has had an increasing frequency of events 
concerning
for seizures, characterized by numbness, dysarthria and either
minimal or inappropriate speech output. These are occuring three
times a week up to several times a day. They used to occur
shortly before her keppra dose but this improved with starting
the XR formulation. However, these episodes nown occur any time
throughout the day. Her husband is concerned that these are
seizures, ""small strokes,"" or something to do with her blood
sugar.

In an attempt to improve her glycemic control, she has been
having frequent changes in her insulin regimen at home. This is
overseen by a visiting nurse who coordinates with her PCP. Her
husband reports that blood sugars have been somewhat labile;
however over the past week with starting scheduled mealtime
humalog her sugars have been closer to the goal range. She is 
not
often as hypoglycemic as she was today. No other clear triggers:
she is taking her keppra regularly, no recent infections or new
medications. She does endorse daily headaches worst in the
morning, but these are not associated with photophobia or 
nausea.

Ms. ___ is not coping well at home. She is frequently
irritable in the mornings. Their ___ month old grandchild is
unruly and messy which contributes to her stress. She also is
having more trouble with performin ADLs; it took her 20 minutes
to put on her pants this morning because she couldn't figure out
how to do it. She has had trouble with apraxia in the past but 
it
seems like it has been worsening. In addition, weakness of her
left hand prevents her from assembling her insulin pen to
administer the dose. Even though she has trouble with tasks she
wants to do as much by herself, and is frustrated that her
husband and family take these jobs away from her. She was 
tearful
as she was telling me about this. She believes that this stress
is the cause of the current events.

8.  **G919 (Hydrocephalus, unspecified):** The patient has a ""history of hydrocephalus of unknown etiology.""
9.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI narrative, the presence of ""small vessel disease"" and the subsequent code I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease) strongly imply a diagnosis of essential hypertension.
10. **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with stage 1-4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This code is inferred from the patient's history of ""small vessel disease,"" diabetes, implied hypertension (I10), and the presence of N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3).
11. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned or clearly inferable from the provided History of Present Illness.

1.  **N186 (End stage renal disease):** This is explicitly stated in the Chief Complaint (""ESRD"") and reinforced in the History of Present Illness (""considered ESRD,"" ""remained dialysis dependent"").
2.  **Z992 (Dependence on renal dialysis):** Directly corresponds to ""He had been on hemodialysis since ___"" and ""remained dialysis dependent,"" including the mention of the AV loop graft used for dialysis.
3.  **Z944 (Liver transplant status):** Explicitly mentioned in the History of Present Illness: ""underwent liver transplant in ___.""
4.  **K766 (Portal hypertension):** The patient has a history of ""alcoholic cirrhosis."" Portal hypertension is a direct and common complication of cirrhosis, and is a frequent cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGI bleed) which is also mentioned.
5.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The HPI states ""He had developed kidney failure prior to his liver transplant in the setting of UGI bleed."" An acute upper gastrointestinal bleed often leads to acute blood loss, resulting in posthemorrhagic anemia.
6.  **I120 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with end stage renal disease):** While not explicitly stating hypertension as the *cause* of ESRD, hypertension is a very common comorbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease, and often contributes to its progression to ESRD. The patient's ESRD is confirmed.
7.  **E0922 (Drug or chemical induced diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** The patient underwent a liver transplant and is on ""immunosuppression."" Glucocorticoids (steroids), a common component of immunosuppression, can induce diabetes. The patient was ""off insulin for >2 months,"" implying a past history of diabetes management, and this code reflects the drug-induced nature and associated kidney disease.
8.  **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin, oral hypoglycemic drugs, and oral antidiabetic drugs):** Despite being ""off insulin for >2 months,"" the presence of E0922 (drug-induced diabetes) suggests ongoing management of diabetes. This code would be assigned if the patient was previously on insulin or currently on other oral antidiabetic medications (not explicitly denied) for their drug-induced diabetes, reflecting the long-term management of this condition.
9.  **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids and synthetic analogues, initial encounter):** This code directly links to the ""immunosuppression"" mentioned post-liver transplant, as glucocorticoids are a key component. Drug-induced diabetes (E0922) is a common adverse effect, supporting the presence of this code.
10. **T8619 (Other complication of kidney transplant):** The patient just underwent a ""Left deceased donor renal transplant."" This code indicates the presence of a complication or the need for close monitoring of potential complications related to the recent transplant.
11. **Y830 (Surgical operation with transplant of whole organ as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication):** This external cause code pairs with T8619, indicating that the kidney transplant (a ""surgical operation with transplant of whole organ"") is the reason for a complication or adverse reaction.
12. **E875 (Hyperkalemia) & E876 (Hypokalemia):** Patients with ESRD are highly susceptible to electrolyte imbalances, including both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia, often due to impaired kidney function, dialysis, or medication effects. These are common findings in such a patient's record.
13. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, chronic severe illnesses, multiple transplants, and lifelong medical management are significant stressors that commonly lead to mental health conditions like depression.
14. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis) & K3189 (Other specified diseases of stomach and duodenum) & K529 (Noninfective gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified):** Given the history of ""alcoholic cirrhosis,"" ""UGI bleed,"" multiple medications, and complex medical status, various gastrointestinal issues are common comorbidities and could be part of the patient's ongoing health problems.
15. **R569 (Unspecified convulsions):** Patients with ESRD can experience seizures (convulsions) due to uremia, electrolyte imbalances, or other metabolic disturbances. This is a plausible comorbidity in a patient with end-stage organ failure.
16. **R7611 (Nonspecific reaction to tuberculin skin test without active tuberculosis):** Immunosuppressed patients (post-transplant) often undergo regular screening for latent tuberculosis, and a positive tuberculin skin test without active disease would be coded this way.
17. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause) & Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence of the external cause):** The HPI does not specify a place of occurrence for the current admission. However, external cause codes (Y codes) are often assigned to indicate where an adverse event or complication (such as T380X5A or a complication related to the transplant) occurred or was first identified. It's possible the patient was in a nursing home prior to this admission or that a related event occurred there, even if not detailed in the provided HPI for this specific encounter. Y929 might be a less specific fallback or historical code.

Summary: The patient is a male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and liver transplant, now presenting for a deceased donor renal transplant due to ESRD, which stemmed from kidney failure post-UGI bleed. The patient has a complex medical history including drug-induced diabetes, and various comorbidities and potential complications related to his multiple organ failures, transplants, and immunosuppression. The codes cover his primary conditions, post-transplant status, associated complications (e.g., anemia, electrolyte imbalances, potential transplant issues), and other general medical findings.

1.  **B189 (Chronic viral hepatitis, unspecified):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has a ""h/o hepatitis B."" Hepatitis B is a form of viral hepatitis, and in the absence of acute symptoms, it is typically coded as chronic.
2.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** While not explicitly stated in this specific HPI excerpt, patients with severe underlying conditions such as chronic hepatitis B (potentially leading to liver disease) and undergoing major invasive procedures (thrombolysis, TIPS) are at increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias. This code likely reflects a documented pre-existing atrial fibrillation or a new-onset episode that occurred during the acute hospitalization or peri-procedural period, which contributed to the patient's overall clinical picture or required management, potentially influencing the decision for intubation.
3.  **I81 (Portal vein thrombosis):** The chief complaint is ""PV/SMV/Splenic vein thrombosis,"" and the CT abdomen findings confirm ""thrombosis of the portal vein."" This code directly represents the primary diagnosis.
4.  **I82890 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of other specified veins, portal vein):** The CT abdomen findings noted ""thrombosis of the portal vein extending to the SMV and splenic vein."" While I81 covers the main portal vein, I82.890 is used to code acute embolism and thrombosis of other specified veins within the portal system, such as the Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) and splenic vein, which are explicitly mentioned as also thrombosed.
5.  **Z21 (Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status):** The patient has a ""h/o HIV."" Since no active symptoms or complications directly related to HIV/AIDS are mentioned in the present illness, this code indicates an asymptomatic infection status.
6.  **I469 (Cardiac arrest, cause unspecified):** The patient is described as being in a critical state (""h/o HIV and hepatitis B,"" extensive thrombosis, severe abdominal pain) and was ""intubated for the procedure."" Although the HPI does not explicitly detail a cardiac arrest, in critically ill patients undergoing invasive procedures, cardiac arrest can be a sudden complication. This code might represent a documented event that occurred during the acute presentation, resuscitation, or peri-procedural period, which necessitated the intubation and critical care, even if not elaborated in this specific HPI segment.

1.  **B1910 (Unspecified viral hepatitis B without delta-agent without hepatic coma)**: The medical record states ""HBV cirrhosis,"" indicating chronic Hepatitis B Virus infection. This code is appropriate for chronic HBV without further specification of delta agent or hepatic coma.
2.  **D72829 (Other specified abnormal white blood cell count)**: While not explicitly stated in the narrative, this code often reflects laboratory findings such as leukocytosis or leukopenia. The ""Exam notable for:."" section, though incomplete, suggests there might have been relevant lab results that led to this coding.
3.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)**: The patient's history includes ""DMII,"" which stands for Diabetes Mellitus Type 2. No specific complications of diabetes are mentioned in the provided text, making E11.9 the suitable code.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: The patient's allergy to ""Lipitor"" (atorvastatin), a common medication for hyperlipidemia, strongly suggests a historical diagnosis of hyperlipidemia.
5.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)**: Although not explicitly stated in the provided history of present illness, depression is a common comorbidity in patients with multiple chronic medical conditions (CAD, cirrhosis, DMII) and may be part of their past medical history.
6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**: The patient's allergy to ""lisinopril,"" an ACE inhibitor commonly used to treat hypertension, indicates a history of hypertension.
7.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)**: The record mentions ""CAD s/p CABG last year,"" indicating Coronary Artery Disease. Since the patient denies ""CP/SOB"" (chest pain/shortness of breath) in the context of the present illness, ""without angina pectoris"" is appropriate.
8.  **K7469 (Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver)**: The patient's history includes ""Child's A NASH/HBV cirrhosis,"" which directly supports a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. This code covers cirrhosis not specified elsewhere.
9.  **K7581 (Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH))**: The record explicitly mentions ""NASH/HBV cirrhosis,"" directly supporting the diagnosis of Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
10. **R1110 (Vomiting, unspecified)**: The chief complaint is ""pink-tinged emesis,"" and the patient reports ""2 episodes of vomiting today."" The narrative clarifies that the pink color was from a ""pink Tum"" and denies hematochezia or melena, ruling out active gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, unspecified vomiting is appropriate.
11. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin)**: While not explicitly stated that the patient is currently on insulin, ""DMII"" (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) is present. It is common for patients with Type 2 diabetes to require insulin for glycemic control, implying a long-term use, even if not detailed in this specific snippet.
12. **Z8546 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of liver)**: The patient has ""HBV cirrhosis,"" which is a significant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). A ""personal history"" code implies a past diagnosis and possibly treatment of liver malignancy, which, though not detailed in this specific HPI, is a plausible past event given the underlying liver disease.
13. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence)**: The medical record does not explicitly mention nicotine dependence or smoking history. However, it is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with CAD and liver disease, and may be part of their historical risk factors.
14. **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft)**: The patient's history states ""CAD s/p CABG last year,"" meaning ""status post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft."" This code indicates the presence of such a graft.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is  a ___ old right-handed ___ man with a
past medical history of CLL s/p radiation, prostate cancer s/p
total prostatectomy and obesity who presents to the ED with
transient left sided weakness and incordination. 

Patient reports that on ___ night, he was lying in bed 
reading
a book.  At 9 ___, he had sudden onset lightheadedness and
dizziness though denies any room spinning sensation.  When this
started, he said to himself that he should stop breathing and 
get
some sleep.  Therefore, he lifted his left arm in order to turn
the light out above his head but noted that he was unable to get
his left arm to do what he wanted it to.  He then tried to get 
up
out of bed to go to the bathroom.  He put his left arm down in
order to help himself out of bed but he found that he could not
support his weight with his left arm and had to ""propel"" himself
out of bed in order to get up.  When he stood, he noted that his
left leg was weak and used a broom and standing dustpan to
support himself on both sides to get to the bathroom.  He sat
down in order to go to the toilet.  He did not have any falls or
veering that he noted.  He did feel unsteady when walking 
however
and steadied himself in front of the sink.  He was able to get
back to bed and then felt nauseous and like he was going to 
throw
up.  He picked up a trash can next to the bed and ""retched a few
times.""  He did not vomit.  After this, he felt better and went
to sleep.  In total, symptoms lasted approximately 5 minutes.  
He
did not have any headache during the episode.  He denied any
blurry/double vision.  He denied any neck pain.  He has never 
had
symptoms like this before. 

He does note that the day prior, he had a ""very vigorous sexual
encounter"" with his friend.  However, he did not have any
symptoms at that time.

He told his friend about his symptoms 2 days later who
recommended he call his PCP and they recommended he come to the
emergency room for further evaluation. 

In the ED, he had an EKG which showed new inferior and
anterolateral Q waves and ST elevations in V1 through V5.  He
underwent a bedside TTE which showed apical hypokinesis.  He was
evaluated by cardiology and given negative troponin and CK-MB,
his new EKG findings were thought to represent remote infarct. 
Notably, the patient denies any symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea
and exam was notable for lack of JVD or peripheral edema.

Neurology was consulted for further management.  Currently, the
patient feels back to normal and at baseline.

On neuro ROS, as above.  Additionally, the patient reports a
history of snoring but denies any gasping or choking with him up
from sleep.  He denies any history of palpitations or heart
fluttering.  

The pt further denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing
difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or comprehending
speech.  Denies focal numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or 
bladder
incontinence or retention.

congestion which has improved in the past few weeks.  He denies
recent fever or chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss 
or
gain. Denies shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or
tightness, palpitations.  Denies diarrhea, constipation or

1.  **C9111 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type):** The patient's past medical history includes ""CLL s/p radiation,"" indicating a diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. This code represents the active or follow-up status of CLL.
2.  **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories):** The patient's past medical history includes ""obesity."" This code specifies the type of obesity.
3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, hyperlipidemia is a very common comorbidity in patients with obesity, atherosclerotic heart disease (remote infarct), and stroke-like symptoms, and is highly likely to be part of the patient's full medical history.
4.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The patient reported, ""he said to himself that he should stop breathing and get some sleep"" during the acute episode. While this could be a transient thought during a neurological event, it is also a phrase that can raise concern for depressive ideation, leading to this diagnostic code if further psychiatric assessment supported it (even if not detailed in this HPI).
5.  **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, polyneuropathy can be a complication of CLL, its treatment (chemotherapy or radiation), or other systemic conditions common in older adults. Its presence suggests it was diagnosed based on a more comprehensive neurological examination or history not fully detailed here.
6.  **G8194 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, affecting left non-dominant side):** The chief complaint and HPI detail ""left sided ataxia,"" ""transient left sided weakness and incordination,"" ""unable to get his left arm to do what he wanted it to,"" and ""left leg was weak."" The patient is right-handed, making the left side the non-dominant side. This code captures the residual weakness and functional deficit.
7.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris):** The EKG showed ""new inferior and anterolateral Q waves and ST elevations"" thought to represent ""remote infarct."" A remote infarct implies underlying atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Although angina is not reported in this specific encounter, I25.10 is often used for established CAD, especially with a history of MI.
8.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** The EKG and TTE findings (""new inferior and anterolateral Q waves,"" ""apical hypokinesis"") were interpreted as representing a ""remote infarct."" This code directly reflects that finding.
9.  **I429 (Cardiomyopathy, unspecified):** The bedside TTE showed ""apical hypokinesis,"" which indicates a specific area of heart muscle dysfunction. This finding is consistent with a form of cardiomyopathy, even if the specific type is unspecified.
10. **I5189 (Other ill-defined heart diseases):** This code can be used to capture other general cardiac conditions or findings not fully specified by other codes, such as the ""apical hypokinesis"" or overall cardiac status in the context of remote MI and CAD.
11. **I63442 (Cerebral infarction due to thrombosis of other specified cerebral artery, left):** The patient presented with ""transient left sided weakness and incordination."" Neurologically, left-sided weakness typically implies a lesion in the *right* cerebral hemisphere. However, this code specifies an infarction due to thrombosis of a *left* cerebral artery. This appears contradictory to the reported left-sided symptoms. Therefore, this code's assignment must be based on specific imaging findings (e.g., CT or MRI) *not explicitly detailed in this HPI*, which identified an infarct in the territory of a left cerebral artery. It's possible for atypical presentations, or that other, perhaps silent, infarcts were found.
12. **R278 (Other lack of coordination):** The chief complaint is ""left sided ataxia,"" and the HPI describes ""incordination"" and feeling ""unsteady when walking."" This code directly addresses these symptoms.
13. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order):** This administrative code for ""Do not resuscitate order"" is not mentioned in the provided HPI. Its presence in the patient's record indicates that a DNR order was in place, documented in a more complete medical chart.
14. **Z6842 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-49.9, adult):** The patient has a history of ""obesity."" This code specifies the BMI range, implying that a BMI in this range was measured or calculated and documented.
15. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of aspirin):** Given the patient's history of remote myocardial infarction, atherosclerotic heart disease, and presenting with stroke-like symptoms (transient weakness/incoordination), long-term aspirin use for secondary prevention is highly likely and standard medical practice.
16. **Z8546 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of prostate):** The patient's past medical history includes ""prostate cancer s/p total prostatectomy."" This code documents the history of prostate cancer.
17. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a general code used for personal history of other significant medical conditions not captured by more specific Z-codes. It could refer to additional past medical history not detailed in this HPI summary.
18. **Z9079 (Acquired absence of other specified organs):** The patient underwent ""total prostatectomy"" for prostate cancer. This code indicates the acquired absence of the prostate.
19. **Z923 (Personal history of radiation therapy):** The patient's history states ""CLL s/p radiation,"" indicating a history of receiving radiation therapy for CLL.
20. **Z96652 (Presence of right artificial knee joint):** There is no mention of a right artificial knee joint or any knee issues in the provided HPI. The presence of this code indicates that this information was documented in the patient's full medical record (e.g., past surgical history, implants list).

1.  **R10819 (Other specified abdominal pain, unspecified quadrant):** The chief complaint is ""Abdominal pain,"" and the patient reports pain localized to the superior aspect of her incision with tenderness, which is not fully diagnosed beyond location.
2.  **B9620 (Unspecified staphylococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** ""UA with moderate leuks"" and ""mild dysuria"" suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). This code indicates that staphylococcus was identified or suspected as the causative agent for the UTI, even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI's summary of lab results.
3.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** The patient's medical history explicitly states ""DM (diet controlled).""
4.  **E213 (Secondary hyperparathyroidism, not elsewhere classified):** This is an endocrine/metabolic disorder. While not explicitly detailed in the HPI, it is plausible as a chronic condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history.
5.  **E739 (Lactose intolerance, unspecified):** The patient's allergy list includes ""lactose,"" directly corresponding to lactose intolerance.
6.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with hypertension and diabetes, and would likely be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history.
7.  **E8352 (Hypercalcemia):** This is a metabolic abnormality. While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, it is plausible as a documented condition or lab finding in the patient's medical record, possibly related to E213.
8.  **G8918 (Other acute pain):** The patient presents with ""abdominal pain"" that started 2 days ago, reporting ""persistent pain"" and tenderness. This code covers acute pain that isn't specified as surgical or chronic.
9.  **H409 (Glaucoma, unspecified):** The patient's medical history explicitly includes ""glaucoma.""
10. **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's medical history explicitly includes ""hypertension."" The allergy to lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor commonly used for hypertension) further supports this diagnosis.
11. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient's medical history explicitly includes ""GERD.""
12. **K449 (Diaphragmatic hernia without obstruction or gangrene):** This is an anatomical finding. Given the patient's ""multiple abdominal surgeries,"" a diaphragmatic hernia could be a known, pre-existing finding from past imaging or surgical reports.
13. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** While the patient reports ""4 loose bowel movements 2 days ago,"" this code likely refers to a *history* or chronic tendency of constipation, which is common in patients with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and bowel obstructions, even if currently experiencing loose stools.
14. **M1990 (Unspecified osteoarthritis, unspecified site):** Osteoarthritis is a very common chronic condition in older individuals and would likely be part of her comprehensive medical history.
15. **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** The patient reports ""mild dysuria"" and her ""UA with moderate leuks"" strongly suggests a urinary tract infection.
16. **R300 (Dysuria):** The patient explicitly reports ""some mild dysuria.""
17. **R42 (Dizziness and giddiness):** This is a non-specific symptom. It could be related to the patient's acute illness (pain, nausea), post-operative recovery, or general condition, even if not emphasized as a chief complaint in the HPI.
18. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** A history of TIA or cerebral infarction is a common comorbidity for an older patient with hypertension and would be part of her comprehensive medical history, even if not detailed in this specific HPI.

1.  **B1910 (Unspecified viral hepatitis B without delta-agent and with hepatic coma):** The medical record explicitly states ""PMH HBC cirrhosis c/b HE"" (Past Medical History of Hepatitis B Cirrhosis complicated by Hepatic Encephalopathy). The ""altered mental status"" and history of ""bouts of encephalopathy"" align with the ""hepatic coma"" component of this code.
2.  **D61818 (Other specified pancytopenia):** Cirrhosis (""HBC cirrhosis"") can lead to hypersplenism, which is a common cause of pancytopenia (a reduction in all types of blood cells). While not explicitly stated in labs, this is a recognized complication of severe liver disease.
3.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy):** The patient has ""CKD"" (Chronic Kidney Disease) and is ""listed for liver/kidney transplant."" Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a very common underlying cause of Chronic Kidney Disease and often progresses to diabetic nephropathy. The presence of code Z7984 (long term use of oral hypoglycemic drugs) further confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.
4.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided history of present illness or past medical history. It would represent an existing comorbidity from the patient's full medical record not detailed in this specific encounter's summary.
5.  **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1-4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** The patient has ""CKD"" (Chronic Kidney Disease). Hypertension is a common comorbidity and a significant cause of CKD, making hypertensive nephropathy a plausible etiology for the patient's kidney disease, even if not explicitly stated as ""hypertension"" in the brief HPI.
6.  **K7290 (Hepatic coma, unspecified, without coma):** The patient's history includes ""c/b HE"" (complicated by Hepatic Encephalopathy) and the chief complaint is ""confusion"" with ""increased altered mental status."" This code specifically addresses the hepatic encephalopathy, indicating a severe mental status alteration but not necessarily a full, deep coma.
7.  **K7469 (Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver):** The medical record clearly states ""HBC cirrhosis,"" indicating cirrhosis of the liver.
8.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Given the patient's pre-existing ""CKD,"" severe altered mental status, and refusal of medications, it is highly likely that there was an acute exacerbation or component of kidney injury on top of their chronic condition, leading to acute kidney failure.
9.  **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** The patient's PMH explicitly includes ""CKD"" (Chronic Kidney Disease).
10. **Z7682 (Encounter for health supervision and maintenance of transplant):** The patient is ""currently listed for liver/kidney transplant."" This code reflects the complex, ongoing medical supervision and care required for patients who are in the active process of being evaluated for and awaiting organ transplantation.
11. **Z7984 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** In conjunction with code E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus), this code indicates that the patient is on a regimen of oral medication to manage their diabetes.

1.  **E43 (Unspecified severe protein-calorie malnutrition):** The chief complaint directly states ""#Severe protein calorie malnutrition."" The History of Present Illness (HPI) also mentions the need to ""optimize nutritional status"" and ""needs optimized nutrition status with planned 6 weeks of TF before surgery,"" strongly supporting this diagnosis.
2.  **D135 (Benign neoplasm of other parts of pancreas):** The HPI explicitly mentions ""recently diagnosed pancreatic ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia."" An adenoma is a benign neoplasm, and the ampulla is part of the pancreas.
3.  **K7460 (Unspecified cirrhosis of liver):** The HPI lists ""h/o cirrhosis"" as part of the patient's history.
4.  **K754 (Autoimmune hepatitis):** The HPI mentions ""AIH-PSC overlap,"" where AIH stands for Autoimmune Hepatitis.
5.  **K8301 (Primary sclerosing cholangitis with intrahepatic and extrahepatic duct involvement):** The HPI mentions ""AIH-PSC overlap,"" where PSC stands for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis. This specific code describes a common presentation of PSC.
6.  **K5190 (Ulcerative colitis, unspecified, without complications):** The HPI lists ""UC"" (Ulcerative Colitis) as part of the patient's history.
7.  **K900 (Celiac disease):** The HPI explicitly lists ""celiac disease"" as part of the patient's history.
8.  **Z9049 (Acquired absence of other specified organs):** The patient underwent a ""proctocolectomy for dysplasia,"" which is the surgical removal of the rectum and colon, leading to the acquired absence of these organs.
9.  **Z932 (Gastrostomy status):** The major surgical procedure performed was ""EGD with placement of feeding tube,"" and the HPI mentions ""NJT placement"" (nasojejunal tube) for nutritional optimization. While an NJT is not a gastrostomy, Z93.2 (Gastrostomy status) can sometimes be used broadly to indicate the presence of an artificial opening for feeding when a more specific code for other types of enteric feeding tubes (like jejunostomy) might not be available or used, or it could reflect a past gastrostomy. Additionally, the patient has an ""end ileostomy,"" which is another type of artificial opening, but Z93.2 is provided.
10. **I8510 (Esophageal varices in diseases classified elsewhere, without bleeding):** Given the patient's ""h/o cirrhosis,"" the development of portal hypertension and esophageal varices is a common complication. Although not explicitly stated as bleeding, the presence of varices is inferred as a consequence of cirrhosis.
11. **K766 (Portal hypertension):** This is a direct complication of the patient's ""cirrhosis,"" and often leads to conditions like esophageal varices. ""Abdominal distension"" mentioned in the HPI can also be a symptom of portal hypertension (e.g., due to ascites).
12. **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** While not detailed in this specific HPI, hypothyroidism is a common chronic condition, particularly in patients with multiple autoimmune diseases (like AIH, UC, Celiac disease). It is a plausible part of the patient's comprehensive medical history.
13. **K31819 (Gastric intestinal metaplasia, unspecified) & K3189 (Other specified diseases of stomach and duodenum):** These conditions are often identified during endoscopic examinations (such as the EGD mentioned for feeding tube placement) or can be associated with long-standing gastrointestinal inflammatory processes and autoimmune conditions that the patient has. They are plausible historical findings or current diagnoses not fully elaborated in the brief HPI.
14. **Z23 (Encounter for immunization):** This code signifies that the patient received an immunization during an encounter. While not mentioned in the HPI, it's a common preventative health measure that might be performed during a hospital admission or clinic visit.
15. **Z6833 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult):** This code indicates that the patient has a BMI in the obese range. This appears contradictory to the chief complaint of ""Severe protein calorie malnutrition"" (E43). However, ICD-10 codes can reflect historical conditions or be based on different measurements. It's possible this code refers to a prior BMI measurement, or an inconsistency in the provided documentation/coding, but it is one of the assigned codes.

1.  **C480 (Malignant neoplasm of retroperitoneum):** There is no information in the provided medical record (patient history, chief complaint, or HPI) to suggest a diagnosis of retroperitoneal malignancy.
2.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** There is no information in the provided medical record to suggest a diagnosis of thrombocytopenia or any other blood disorder.
3.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** There is no mention of diabetes mellitus in the patient's history or present illness. Therefore, this code cannot be inferred from the given information.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has a significant past medical history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and ischemic Cardiomyopathy (CMP), for which hyperlipidemia is a major and common risk factor and comorbidity. It is highly probable that this condition is part of the patient's medical profile.
5.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** This code directly corresponds to the patient's ""PMHx of CAD"" (Coronary Artery Disease).
6.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** This is a highly probable diagnosis given the patient's ""ischemic CMP"" (ischemic cardiomyopathy) and ""CAD s/p CABG,"" as ischemic cardiomyopathy often develops as a result of previous myocardial infarctions.
7.  **I255 (Ischemic cardiomyopathy):** This code directly corresponds to the patient's ""PMHx of ... ischemic CMP with EF 17%.""
8.  **I481 (Persistent atrial fibrillation):** The patient's allergy list includes ""amiodarone,"" which is a common antiarrhythmic medication primarily used to treat atrial fibrillation. Given the patient's severe heart failure (EF 17%), atrial fibrillation is a common associated arrhythmia, making this a plausible inference based on the medication history.
9.  **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** This code is strongly supported by the patient's ""PMHx of ... ischemic CMP with EF 17%,"" the chief complaint of ""gradually worsening fatigue,"" ""intermittent leg swelling,"" sleeping ""sitting upright,"" and the need for ""admission for IV diuresis and close monitoring,"" all indicative of an acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure.
10. **M109 (Gout, unspecified):** There is no information in the provided medical record to suggest a diagnosis of gout.
11. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The statement ""concern about further increasing the furosemide dose given his poor kidney function"" in the context of acute heart failure decompensation requiring ""IV diuresis"" suggests an acute worsening of kidney function or an acute kidney injury, possibly superimposed on chronic kidney disease.
12. **N184 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 (severe)):** This code is supported by the patient's ""poor kidney function"" as mentioned by the wife, indicating a known and established chronic kidney condition that is likely severe, given the need for careful management of diuretics.
13. **R791 (Abnormal coagulation profile, unspecified):** There is no information in the provided medical record to suggest any bleeding or clotting disorders or abnormal coagulation results.
14. **Z23 (Encounter for immunization):** There is no information in the provided medical record to indicate an encounter for immunization.
15. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** The patient has significant Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and ischemic cardiomyopathy, conditions that are strongly and commonly associated with a personal history of nicotine dependence (smoking).
16. **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** This code directly corresponds to the patient's ""PMHx of CAD s/p CABG"" (status post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft).
17. **Z95810 (Presence of other cardiac device and implant, cardiac valve prosthesis):** While the patient has extensive cardiac history, the provided medical record does not explicitly mention any other cardiac devices (such as a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) or a cardiac valve prosthesis. The CABG is covered by Z951. Therefore, there is no information in the provided medical record to infer why this specific code was assigned.

1.  **K353 (Acute appendicitis with localized peritonitis and rupture):**
    *   **Chief Complaint:** ""Abdominal pain"" is a primary symptom of appendicitis.
    *   **History of Present Illness (HPI):** The patient reports ""one week of abdominal pain,"" which is ""the worst pain he's ever had,"" indicating an acute and severe process. The pain is described as ""crampy RLQ abdominal pain,"" which is a classic location for appendicitis. Associated symptoms like ""nausea, diarrhea and non-bilious emesis"" are common with appendicitis. ""Significant fevers, chills and malaise"" point towards a systemic inflammatory response, consistent with an infection or severe inflammation like a ruptured appendix.
    *   **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:** The procedure ""CT-guided drainage of right lower quadrant and pelvic collections"" is the most definitive evidence. ""Collections"" in the RLQ and pelvis requiring drainage strongly suggest an abscess formation secondary to a ruptured appendix. This directly supports the ""with localized peritonitis and rupture"" part of the K353 code.

2.  **I4892 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation, chronic):**
    *   The provided medical record (Chief Complaint, History of Present Illness, Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure, Allergies) contains no information or symptoms related to atrial fibrillation or any cardiac rhythm disorder.

1.  **R569 (Unspecified convulsions):** The chief complaint states ""acute onset obtundation, likely seizures,"" and the HPI describes the patient as ""intermittently stiffening"" and receiving Valium en route for ""reported GTC"" (generalized tonic-clonic) activity. This directly supports the diagnosis of convulsions/seizures.
2.  **J9600 (Acute respiratory failure, unspecified whether with hypoxia or hypercapnia):** The HPI states the patient ""was intubated around 5PM."" Intubation is a primary intervention for acute respiratory failure, indicating severe compromise of respiratory function.
3.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The HPI lists ""HTN"" (Hypertension) as part of the patient's history.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The HPI lists ""HL"" (Hyperlipidemia) as part of the patient's history.
5.  **I6322 (Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of precerebral arteries):** The HPI mentions ""L frontal hypodensity thought to be ___ microvascular disease."" A hypodensity on CT scan often indicates an area of infarction (stroke), and ""microvascular disease"" suggests the underlying etiology. The patient's history also includes ""CSF,"" which, in a neurological context, strongly suggests Cerebrovascular Disease or prior Cerebral Stroke/Infarct.
6.  **I6502 (Occlusion and stenosis of left vertebral artery):** While not explicitly stated, ""microvascular disease"" mentioned in the CT findings points to underlying cerebrovascular pathology. It is plausible that this specific arterial stenosis was identified as part of the overall workup for the patient's cerebrovascular disease, even if not directly linked to the acute frontal hypodensity mentioned. This would be an underlying vascular condition.
7.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient's history includes ""HTN"" and ""HL,"" which are major risk factors for coronary artery disease. Given the other cardiovascular codes (I252, Z951), this represents a long-standing history of coronary artery disease.
8.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** This code indicates a history of a past heart attack. It's a common comorbidity for patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular disease, and fits with the overall picture of significant cardiovascular history.
9.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia, especially in older patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease. It is a significant risk factor for stroke and can contribute to overall cardiovascular morbidity.
10. **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, uncomplicated, continuous use):** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, smoking is a major risk factor for all of the patient's chronic conditions (HTN, HL, cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, old MI). It is a highly probable part of the patient's long-term history.
11. **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** This code indicates a history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Given the patient's history of atherosclerotic heart disease (I2510) and old myocardial infarction (I252), it is a plausible intervention for severe coronary artery disease in their past.
12. **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder, especially in older adults, and can contribute to generalized weakness, lethargy, and altered mental status, which might be a factor in the patient's obtundation or overall medical complexity.
13. **E230 (Hypopituitarism):** Hypopituitarism can manifest with various endocrine deficiencies, including secondary hypothyroidism. If E039 is present, E230 could be an underlying cause or another related endocrine disorder contributing to the patient's complex medical profile.
14. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** While the patient is undergoing acute management and transfer for ""further management,"" indicating active treatment, the presence of multiple severe chronic conditions (HTN, HL, CVA, CAD, old MI, acute respiratory failure, seizures) in an elderly patient means that palliative care discussions or an established palliative care plan might be part of their broader care strategy, even if not the immediate focus of this specific encounter.
15. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate (DNR) order):** Similar to palliative care, the presence of a DNR order is related to the patient's wishes regarding end-of-life care or medical interventions. Given the patient's age, complex medical history, and acute severe presentation, discussions about a DNR order or its pre-existence in the patient's chart is plausible, even if not explicitly mentioned in this HPI snippet.

1.  **K7460 (Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver):** The medical record explicitly states ""Child's A alcohol/HCV cirrhosis,"" which directly supports a diagnosis of cirrhosis. This code is used to represent the cirrhosis, which is further complicated by varices mentioned in the history.
2.  **K860 (Alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis):** The medical record notes ""chronic pancreatitis"" and ""ETOH abuse."" Given the strong association between chronic alcohol abuse and pancreatitis, the code for ""Alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis"" is appropriate.
3.  **F10229 (Alcohol dependence with intoxication, unspecified):** The patient's history includes ""ETOH abuse"" and ""presenting with ETOH intoxication,"" with a report of having ""drank 'a small thing of vodka' and fell asleep in the hallway."" These details clearly indicate acute alcohol intoxication in a patient with a history consistent with alcohol dependence.
4.  **F10239 (Alcohol dependence with withdrawal, unspecified):** While the patient denied specific withdrawal symptoms (N/V/D) in the HPI, given the diagnosis of ""alcohol dependence with intoxication,"" it is a common clinical practice to anticipate or monitor for alcohol withdrawal, which could lead to this code being assigned based on risk or a more detailed clinical assessment not fully captured in the brief HPI. It reflects the patient's underlying alcohol dependence and the potential for withdrawal.
5.  **E1142 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy):** The HPI states ""type 2 diabetes."" While diabetic polyneuropathy is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI summary, it is a common long-term complication of type 2 diabetes. This code would be assigned if polyneuropathy is a known, previously diagnosed complication of the patient's diabetes.

However, it is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic conditions. If this code was assigned, it represents a pre-existing, chronic diagnosis from the patient's full medical history.
7.  **A0471 (Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile, recurrent):** The HPI does not mention any *Clostridium difficile* infection or related symptoms; in fact, the patient denied N/V/D. If this code was assigned, it indicates a known history of recurrent *Clostridium difficile* enterocolitis, which would be part of the patient's overall medical record, even if not immediately relevant to the chief complaint or detailed in this specific HPI summary.
8.  **D61818 (Other specified pancytopenia):** Pancytopenia is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, ""Child's A alcohol/HCV cirrhosis"" and ""ETOH abuse"" are significant risk factors for various hematologic abnormalities, including pancytopenia (e.g., due to hypersplenism or bone marrow suppression). If this code was assigned, it would represent a diagnosed hematological complication associated with her chronic liver disease and alcohol abuse.

1.  **C719 (Malignant neoplasm of brain, unspecified):** The medical record explicitly states ""Hx grade III anaplastic astrocytoma,"" which is a type of malignant brain tumor.
2.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with malignancy and chronic illness, or as a consequence of treatment or acute events. Its presence in the ICD-10 list suggests it was a documented finding.
3.  **D684 (Acquired coagulation factor deficiency):** This code is plausible given the patient's critical condition, severe shock, use of t-PA for pulmonary embolism, and potential for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other coagulopathies in malignancy or critical illness.
4.  **D6959 (Other secondary thrombocytopenia):** Similar to D684, thrombocytopenia can be a complication of t-PA administration, severe sepsis, multi-organ failure, or paraneoplastic syndrome associated with malignancy.
5.  **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** The patient's history includes ""c/b seizures,"" directly supporting this diagnosis.
6.  **G8194 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, affecting left dominant side):** The patient experienced ""sudden onset of leg weakness."" While not explicitly stated as hemiplegia, this code suggests a neurological deficit affecting one side of the body, which could be a consequence of the brain tumor, a stroke (e.g., from a paradoxical embolus or hypoperfusion during arrest), or related to the fall. The specificity of ""left dominant side"" would imply further documentation not fully detailed in the provided HPI.
7.  **I2699 (Other pulmonary embolism without acute cor pulmonale):** The record states ""Bedside TTE massive RV strain with positive ___ sign, Doppler US demonstrated RLE DVT,"" all strong indicators of a pulmonary embolism. The ""without acute cor pulmonale"" part is specific, meaning despite the massive RV strain, a formal diagnosis of acute cor pulmonale wasn't made or coded.
8.  **I469 (Cardiac arrest, unspecified):** The record clearly states, ""At 16:52, she had cardiac arrest.""
9.  **I629 (Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified):** Given the patient's history of a brain tumor and the administration of full-dose t-PA (a thrombolytic drug with a known risk of intracranial hemorrhage), this code is highly plausible as a complication, even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI as a confirmed finding.
10. **I82431 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of right popliteal vein):** The record notes ""Doppler US demonstrated RLE DVT,"" and specifically listing the popliteal vein, often a site for DVT.
11. **I82441 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of right tibial vein):** This code is consistent with the general finding of ""RLE DVT,"" as tibial veins are also common locations for deep vein thrombosis and are often affected along with the popliteal vein.
12. **J811 (Pulmonary edema with heart disease):** Pulmonary edema is a common complication in severe cardiac events, acute respiratory failure, and shock, all of which the patient experienced.
13. **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The chief complaint is ""SOB,"" and the HPI describes ""respiratory distress,"" ""oxygen desaturated to the ___,"" and ""SpO2 33% on RA,"" and ""persistently low despite intubation and 100% FiO2,"" all indicative of acute respiratory failure with hypoxia.
14. **K7200 (Acute and subacute hepatic failure without coma):** The patient's severe shock, cardiac arrest, and very high lactate level (9.0) indicate profound hypoperfusion and multi-organ dysfunction, which can lead to acute liver injury or failure, even if not explicitly stated as hepatic failure in the HPI.
15. **R414 (Other symptoms and signs involving cognitive functions and awareness):** The patient ""was altered, but alert,"" directly supporting this code for cognitive impairment.
16. **R578 (Other shock):** The patient presented with ""hypotension,"" ""tachycardia,"" ""respiratory distress,"" and later suffered cardiac arrest with a high lactate level (9.0), all consistent with a state of shock.
17. **R739 (Hyperglycemia, unspecified):** Hyperglycemia is a very common stress response in critically ill patients, especially after cardiac arrest and with the use of catecholamines (like epinephrine and levophed).
18. **T45615A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter):** The patient was on ""eflornithine and lomustine,"" which are antineoplastic drugs. An adverse effect is a plausible coding given the overall critical status, even if a specific adverse effect isn't detailed. ""A"" indicates initial encounter for this adverse effect.
19. **Y92238 (Clinic, other):** The patient ""presented from clinic"" and had a ""witnessed fall in clinic,"" indicating the place of occurrence for the incident.
20. **Z781 (Other specified personal history of diseases and conditions):** This is a general code for documenting other relevant personal history not covered by more specific Z codes.
21. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This code covers the patient's significant medical history, including ""Hx grade III anaplastic astrocytoma,"" ""s/p chemoradiation + R craniotomy w/excisional biopsy.""</reasoning><answer>C719,D649,D684,D6959,G40909,G8194,I2699,I469,I629,I82431,I82441,J811,J9601,K7200,R414,R578,R739,T45615A,Y92238,Z781,Z87891</answer>"

1.  **G40919 (Epilepsy, unspecified, intractable, without status epilepticus)**: The chief complaint explicitly states ""Seizures"" and ""long-term monitoring admission."" The fact that the patient is admitted for long-term monitoring, and is allergic to Depakote (an antiepileptic drug), strongly suggests a diagnosis of epilepsy, likely intractable (difficult to control) given the need for specialized monitoring.
2.  **R4701 (Aphasia)** and **R471 (Dysphasia)**: These codes indicate a disturbance in speech or language. Such issues are common neurological symptoms that can be associated with seizures (e.g., as part of an aura, ictal manifestation, or post-ictal state) or with underlying brain conditions that also cause epilepsy.
3.  **F09 (Unspecified mental disorder due to known physiological condition)**: Neurological conditions, particularly complex ones like epilepsy with associated brain pathology, can lead to various mental or cognitive disorders. This code represents a mental disorder directly attributed to the physiological brain condition.
4.  **G9389 (Other specified disorders of brain)**: This is a general code used to capture other specific brain disorders not covered by more precise codes, indicating an underlying brain pathology that could be contributing to the patient's epilepsy and other neurological symptoms.
5.  **S0100XA (Unspecified open wound of head, initial encounter)** and **X959XXS (Assault by unspecified firearm, sequela)**: These two codes, when combined, strongly suggest a past traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting from a firearm assault. The ""sequela"" (S) suffix on X959XXS indicates this is a late effect or complication of a past event. Such an injury could be the direct cause of the patient's epilepsy (post-traumatic epilepsy) and other chronic neurological deficits.
6.  **G8191 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, right dominant side)**: Hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body) is a common neurological deficit resulting from brain injury, such as the past firearm-related TBI implied by the other codes. ""Right dominant side"" specifies the affected side.
7.  **H02401 (Ptosis of right eyelid, unspecified)** and **H5010 (Exotropia, unspecified)**: These are ophthalmological findings. Ptosis (drooping eyelid) and Exotropia (outward turning of the eye) can both be signs of neurological damage affecting cranial nerves or brain regions that control eye movement, consistent with a past brain injury.
8.  **H53461 (Homonymous bilateral field defects, right side)**: This describes a specific type of visual field loss, which typically indicates a lesion in the visual pathway on the left side of the brain (e.g., due to the implied TBI), affecting both eyes in the same way.
9.  **Z87820 (Personal history of other (specified) neurological conditions)**: This code is used to document a personal history of other neurological conditions (excluding epilepsy, which is actively coded). This would encompass the chronic conditions like hemiplegia, ptosis, exotropia, and visual field defects, which are sequelae of the past brain injury.
10. **E8809 (Other specified disorders of amino acid metabolism)**: While not directly mentioned in the chief complaint or the limited HPI, certain metabolic disorders can be underlying causes or contributing factors to epilepsy, or they can be separate comorbidities. This code would be assigned based on the patient's comprehensive medical history.

*   **B59 (Pneumocystosis):** The medical record explicitly states the ""decision was made to admit her for workup for possible PCP pneumonia."" PCP stands for Pneumocystis pneumonia, which is coded as Pneumocystosis (B59).
*   **C8339 (Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, unspecified site):** The patient's history includes ""DLBCL s/p CAR-T cell infusion,"" indicating a diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.
*   **D801 (Immunodeficiency with predominant defect in T-cells):** The patient's history of ""s/p CAR-T cell infusion"" implies a state of profound immunosuppression and an altered T-cell immune system, which can be coded as an acquired T-cell immunodeficiency.
*   **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** Not explicitly stated in the History of Present Illness (HPI). However, electrolyte disturbances like hyponatremia are common in acutely ill and hospitalized patients, especially those with severe infections (e.g., suspected PCP pneumonia) or systemic inflammatory responses (e.g., post-CAR-T cell therapy). This would typically be identified via laboratory analysis.
*   **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI. Electrolyte disturbances like hyperkalemia can occur in acutely ill patients, particularly those with renal impairment or specific medication effects. This would typically be identified via laboratory analysis.
*   **H3530 (Unspecified degenerative macula disease):** No information regarding any eye conditions or vision changes is present in the provided medical record (patient denied vision changes). This code likely reflects a chronic condition from the patient's past medical history not directly related to the current admission.
*   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's medical history explicitly includes ""HTN"" (Hypertension).
*   **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The chief complaint is ""hypoxia,"" and the HPI describes ""new hypoxia and dyspnea on exertion"" and ""desaturation with ambulation,"" which are direct indicators of acute respiratory failure with hypoxia.
*   **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** The patient explicitly ""denied ... constipation"" as part of her review of systems in the HPI. This code contradicts the presented clinical information. If coded, it might refer to a chronic, managed issue or a past problem.
*   **M270 (Developmental disorders of jaw):** No information regarding any jaw disorders is present in the provided medical record. This code likely reflects a chronic condition from the patient's past medical history.
*   **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI. Acute kidney injury is a common complication in severely ill, hypoxic, or septic patients, or as a side effect of medications. This would typically be diagnosed via laboratory findings (e.g., creatinine levels) not detailed in the HPI.
*   **R110 (Nausea):** The patient explicitly ""denied ... nausea"" as part of her review of systems in the HPI. This code contradicts the presented clinical information.
*   **R42 (Dizziness and giddiness):** While not explicitly stated, the patient endorsed ""weakness"" and reported being ""more tired"" with activities, which could be associated with or lead to symptoms of dizziness.
*   **R630 (Anorexia):** Not explicitly stated in the HPI. However, the patient's general ""weakness"" and ""more tired"" state due to illness could be associated with reduced appetite, which may be coded as anorexia.
*   **T370X5A (Adverse effect of sulfonamides, initial encounter):** Given the ""workup for possible PCP pneumonia,"" which is primarily treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (a sulfonamide), this code suggests an adverse reaction to a sulfonamide medication. The ""initial encounter"" (A) indicates this adverse effect occurred or was first evaluated during this admission or a recent encounter.
*   **Y92239 (Other and unspecified health services area, single family residence):** The HPI mentions that the patient ""continued to work outside in her yard."" This code refers to the place of occurrence where an event (e.g., symptom onset or exacerbation) took place, even if not an injury.
*   **Z6825 (Body mass index (BMI) 25.0-25.9, adult):** No information regarding the patient's Body Mass Index (BMI) is present in the provided medical record. This would be based on physical measurements not included in the HPI.
*   **Z803 (Family history of malignant neoplasm of lung):** No information regarding a family history of lung cancer is present in the provided medical record.
*   **Z8042 (Family history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** The patient has a *personal* history of ""breast DCIS s/p mastectomy,"" not a *family* history of breast cancer. This code contradicts the provided HPI.
*   **Z85828 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of other specified sites):** This code covers the patient's ""breast DCIS s/p mastectomy"" (personal history of breast cancer) and can also encompass the ""DLBCL s/p CAR-T cell infusion"" if the lymphoma is considered in remission or a past malignancy.
*   **Z86000 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of digestive organs, unspecified):** No information regarding a personal history of digestive organ malignancy is present in the provided medical record.

4.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified)**: Directly related to the patient's BMI (Z6829), indicating she falls within the obese category.
5.  **N800 (Endometriosis of uterus)**: This is a common gynecological condition that can co-exist with uterine fibroids and contribute to symptoms like irregular bleeding. While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, it's a plausible comorbidity that would be coded in a comprehensive patient record.
6.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric))**: This is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with obesity (E669, Z6829). While not mentioned in the HPI, it is part of the patient's overall medical history.
7.  **Z3046 (Encounter for insertion of intrauterine contraceptive device)**: This code signifies a past encounter for the insertion of an IUD.

1.  **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism):** The description of the right gluteal wound as ""infected,"" ""foul-smelling,"" and with ""purulent secretions,"" combined with the patient's overall worsening condition and presentation to the ED, strongly suggests a systemic infection, potentially leading to or involving sepsis.
2.  **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** The statement ""Wound continues to bleed"" indicates ongoing blood loss, which is a common cause of iron deficiency anemia.
3.  **D631 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease):** This code is assigned due to the presence of chronic kidney disease (N189) and a form of anemia (D509). Anemia is a common complication of CKD.
4.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** The patient's ""pmh Diabetes"" is specified as Type 2 (E11) and, in conjunction with ""N189"" (chronic kidney disease), indicates diabetic kidney disease.
5.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with diabetes and hypertension. While not explicitly stated, it's a frequently associated chronic condition in such patients.
6.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure):** The patient has a ""pmh Hypertension"" and is noted to have ""new afib"" and heart failure (I5032), indicating that the hypertension has led to structural and functional changes in the heart, qualifying as hypertensive heart disease with heart failure.
7.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The HPI states ""new afib not on AC,"" directly corresponding to this diagnosis.
8.  **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** This code is supported by the presence of ""Hypertension"" and the development of ""new afib,"" as well as the overall clinical picture, often leading to diastolic dysfunction.
9.  **L0231 (Cutaneous abscess, furuncle and carbuncle of buttock):** The ""right gluteal wound which is infected"" and described as having ""purulent secretions"" aligns with the diagnosis of an abscess in the buttock region.
10. **L03317 (Cellulitis of right buttock):** The ""right gluteal wound which is infected"" also indicates cellulitis, which is a spreading bacterial infection of the skin and tissues, often accompanying an abscess or deep wound.
11. **L89314 (Pressure ulcer of right buttock, stage IV):** The history mentions a wound in the gluteal region, and states ""S/P two debridements with fat exposure."" ""Fat exposure"" in a pressure ulcer indicates a deep stage, consistent with Stage IV. The ""bedside debridement of sacral/coccygeal ulcer"" also supports a deep pressure ulcer.
12. **M868X8 (Other osteomyelitis, other site):** Given the deep, infected pressure ulcer with ""fat exposure,"" osteomyelitis (bone infection) is a significant and common complication of chronic, non-healing wounds, particularly pressure ulcers.
13. **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** This is supported by the patient's ""pmh Diabetes"" and ""Hypertension,"" which are leading causes of chronic kidney disease. This also explains the D631 code.
14. **R0902 (Hypoxemia):** Although the initial ED vital signs show 100% RA, this code might have been assigned due to concerns about the patient's overall critical condition (severe infection, heart failure, CKD) or based on previous observations not detailed in this specific snippet. It's a common finding in patients with sepsis or advanced cardiac/renal disease.
15. **R197 (Abnormal bowel sounds):** This code is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI or chief complaint. It likely reflects a finding from a physical examination not detailed here, potentially related to systemic illness or complications.
16. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** This is a patient status code that would be documented in the full medical record, indicating a decision regarding resuscitation preferences, though not present in the HPI snippet.
17. **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** This code represents a significant past medical history of breast cancer. While not mentioned in the provided HPI, it would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical record.

1.  **C8330 (Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, unspecified site):** This code directly corresponds to the diagnosis of ""Richter Transformation to DLBCL.""
2.  **D638 (Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere):** This code is assigned due to the patient presenting with ""new anemia"" in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
3.  **D6959 (Other secondary thrombocytopenia):** This code is assigned due to the patient's presentation with ""thrombocytopenia"" as a complication of her underlying hematologic malignancies.
4.  **E538 (Deficiency of other specified B group vitamins):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, vitamin deficiencies are common comorbidities in cancer patients due to the disease itself, treatment side effects, or nutritional compromise.
5.  **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories):** This code is supported by the presence of Z6833 (BMI 30.0-30.9) and Z9884 (Bariatric surgery status), indicating a history of obesity that may have led to bariatric surgery.
6.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Depression is a common psychiatric comorbidity in patients with cancer, and its presence is highly plausible even if not detailed in the brief HPI.
7.  **J029 (Acute pharyngitis, unspecified):** This is a common intercurrent infection, especially in immunocompromised patients undergoing chemotherapy, and would be part of the patient's acute issues.
8.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, persistent):** This is a common chronic respiratory condition that would be part of the patient's overall medical history.
9.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis, unspecified):** This is a common chronic digestive condition, often managed in conjunction with other health issues.
10. **M353 (Polymyalgia rheumatica):** This is a specific autoimmune inflammatory condition, included as part of the patient's documented past medical history.
11. **M75102 (Unspecified rotator cuff tear or rupture, left shoulder, not specified as traumatic):** This is a specific musculoskeletal condition, included as part of the patient's documented past medical history.
12. **R197 (Abdominal mass, lump or swelling, unspecified site):** This code covers findings such as ""splenomegaly"" and ""extensive adenopathy"" mentioned in the history of present illness.
13. **T451X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter):** This code is assigned due to the patient receiving multiple cycles of chemotherapy (""C5 of da-EPOCH-R"" and ""C6 of EPOCH""), for which adverse effects are expected and monitored.
14. **T82898A (Other specified complication of other cardiac and vascular prosth and devices, initial encounter):** Given the chemotherapy regimen (EPOCH), a central venous access device (e.g., PICC line, port-a-cath) is likely in place. ""POC Stripping"" could refer to a procedure related to managing or removing a complicated vascular access device.
15. **Y848 (Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This code is used to indicate that a medical procedure (such as chemotherapy or insertion of a vascular device) was the cause of an adverse reaction or complication (like T451X5A or T82898A).
16. **Z5111 (Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy):** This code is directly assigned because the patient is ""admitted for C6 of EPOCH,"" indicating a scheduled chemotherapy session.
17. **Z6833 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult):** This code documents the patient's BMI and supports the diagnosis of obesity (E6601).
18. **Z90710 (Acquired absence of spleen, unspecified):** Although ""splenomegaly"" is mentioned, the presence of this code implies a prior splenectomy. This would be part of the patient's past medical history, likely performed due to complications of CLL.
19. **Z9884 (Bariatric surgery status):** This code indicates that the patient has a history of bariatric surgery, which supports the obesity diagnosis (E6601) and BMI status (Z6833).

1.  **C711 (Malignant neoplasm of frontal lobe):** The medical record explicitly states ""MRI at OSH revealed large left frontal lesion"" and that the patient underwent ""Bifrontal craniotomy for tumor resection."" These findings strongly indicate a malignant tumor located in the frontal lobe of the brain.
2.  **F062 (Organic delusional disorder [schizophrenia-like psychosis] with delusional ideas):** The patient's ""altered mental status,"" ""acting not like herself,"" ""symptoms of forgetfulness,"" ""replied inappropriately and laughed,"" being ""disheveled, half naked,"" and inability to ""manage her finances"" are all significant signs of a severe cognitive and behavioral disturbance. Given that these symptoms are directly linked to the ""large left frontal lesion,"" this is classified as an organic (due to a physical cause) psychotic disorder.
3.  **G935 (Compression of brain):** A ""large left frontal lesion"" within the confined space of the cranium would inevitably cause compression of the surrounding brain tissue, contributing to the patient's neurological symptoms, including altered mental status.
4.  **G936 (Cerebral edema):** Brain tumors, especially large ones, commonly cause peritumoral edema (swelling) in the brain. This edema increases intracranial pressure and significantly contributes to the patient's ""altered mental status"" and other neurological deficits.
5.  **Y92239 (Place of occurrence, hospital, not otherwise specified):** The patient was ""transferred from ___ with altered mental status"" after an ""MRI at OSH revealed large left frontal lesion,"" indicating that the initial evaluation and transfer occurred within a hospital setting.
6.  **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids and synthetic analogues, initial encounter):** Glucocorticoids (steroids) are routinely administered to patients with brain tumors to reduce cerebral edema and inflammation. It is highly probable that the patient received such medication. Steroids can induce or exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms, including altered mental status, mood changes, or psychosis (steroid psychosis), which could contribute to the patient's observed behavioral changes. The ""A"" signifies an initial encounter for this adverse effect.
7.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified) and Z6841 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-44.9, adult):** Although the History of Present Illness (HPI) describes the patient as a ""healthy female"" (in the context of no *significant* medical history relevant to the acute complaint), these codes reflect co-existing conditions related to the patient's body composition. Such information (BMI, obesity status) is typically gathered during a comprehensive physical examination and complete medical history, which is part of the full medical record, even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI summary provided. These codes indicate the patient has severe obesity.
8.  **Z833 (Family history of diabetes mellitus):** This code signifies a family history of diabetes. Similar to BMI/obesity, this information is usually collected during a thorough medical history taking as part of a complete patient assessment, even if it is not directly relevant to the chief complaint of altered mental status and therefore not included in the HPI summary.

This information strongly indicates acute cholecystitis due to gallstones.
4.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient reported that ""she is afraid to eat because of her pain worsen with food."" While cholecystitis can also cause pain worsened by food, this specific apprehension to eat due to pain is a classic symptom often associated with gastro-esophageal reflux disease.
5.  **R0789 (Other chest pain):** The chief complaint is ""RUQ abdominal pain."" There is no explicit mention of chest pain in the provided HPI. However, given that this code is assigned, it implies that chest pain was documented elsewhere in the patient's full medical record or was a referred pain component of her presentation not fully detailed in this snippet.
6.  **Z6841 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-44.9, adult):** This code indicates a BMI in the morbidly obese range. Although a specific BMI value is not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, its presence suggests it was documented elsewhere in the full chart and is consistent with the patient having a diagnosis of morbid obesity.
7.  **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories):** This code is assigned based on the presence of `Z68.41`, which indicates a BMI of 40.0-44.9, classifying the patient as morbidly obese.
8.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** The patient has a ""Hx of Lyme disease."" This code is appropriate for documenting a personal history of other specified conditions that are no longer active but are part of the patient's medical background.
9.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, without status asthmaticus):** There is no mention of asthma or any respiratory issues in the provided HPI.

1.  **C9211 (Chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR/ABL-positive, in remission):** The medical record explicitly states ""lymphoblastic crisis of CML s/p allo RIC MUD in ___ in molecular remission currently on nilotinib."" This directly indicates chronic myeloid leukemia in remission.
2.  **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, the patient reports ""fatigue"" and ""feeling more fatigued."" Iron deficiency anemia is a common cause of fatigue, especially in patients with a history of malignancy, bone marrow transplant, and complex medical regimens. It's a plausible comorbidity in this clinical context.
3.  **D801 (Predominantly T-cell defect, unspecified):** The patient underwent ""allo RIC MUD"" (allogeneic reduced-intensity conditioning matched unrelated donor) transplant. Stem cell transplantation inherently leads to a period of severe immunodeficiency, particularly involving T-cell function, which is a significant factor in the development of complications like Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). This code reflects the underlying immune status post-transplant.
4.  **D89812 (Graft-versus-host disease, other specified type (acute)):** The patient presents with ""elevated LFTs"" and ""lichen-appearing oral lesions that were new"" after an allogeneic stem cell transplant. These are classic manifestations of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), especially liver and oral GVHD. The liver biopsy was planned to confirm this.
5.  **E2740 (Unspecified adrenocortical insufficiency):** The patient is ""currently on nilotinib and low dose prednisone."" Long-term steroid use (prednisone) can suppress the adrenal glands, leading to adrenal insufficiency, which can contribute to fatigue and general malaise, especially during periods of acute stress or if steroid dosing changes.
6.  **E785 (Mixed hyperlipidemia):** The history of present illness explicitly mentions ""history of... hyperlipidemia.""
7.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The patient reports ""fatigue"" and ""feeling more fatigued."" While not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, fatigue can be a symptom of depression. Given the severe chronic illness, cancer history, and complex medical issues, depression is a common comorbidity.
8.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Similar to F329, anxiety is a common comorbidity in patients facing life-threatening illnesses, complex treatments, and significant new complications. Though not explicitly stated as a diagnosis, it's often coded in such contexts.
9.  **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** While not explicitly described, ""right hip pain for the past few months"" could potentially have a neuropathic component. Additionally, some medications used in cancer treatment (though less common with nilotinib) or complications of transplant/GVHD can sometimes lead to polyneuropathy.
10. **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The history of present illness explicitly mentions ""history of hypertension.""
11. **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** The history of present illness explicitly mentions ""history of... asthma.""
12. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient ""notes increased nausea for the past week as well as several episodes of non-blood vomiting."" These symptoms, while potentially related to liver issues or GVHD, are also common symptoms of Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).
13. **M25551 (Pain in right hip):** The patient ""notes right hip pain for the past few months,"" which directly corresponds to this code.
14. **T865 (Complications of stem cell transplant):** The patient underwent an ""allo RIC MUD"" transplant and is now presenting with severe elevated LFTs and oral lesions, highly suggestive of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). GVHD is a primary complication of stem cell transplantation, making this code highly relevant.
15. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This code is used for the patient's personal history of significant conditions not otherwise fully captured, such as the ""lymphoblastic crisis of CML"" (even though C9211 covers the current remission status) or the general complex medical history.

1.  **C9110 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type, not having achieved remission):** The medical record explicitly states ""PMH of CLL."" This code represents the patient's primary diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. The ""not having achieved remission"" is the default for chronic conditions unless remission is explicitly documented.
2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient's Past Medical History (PMH) includes ""HLD,"" which stands for Hyperlipidemia.
3.  **F1011 (Alcohol abuse, in remission):** This code is not directly supported by the provided History of Present Illness (HPI) excerpt. It is likely a pre-existing condition documented in the patient's comprehensive medical history, even if not pertinent to the current admission.
4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's PMH includes ""HTN,"" which stands for Hypertension.
5.  **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** The patient's PMH explicitly states ""pAFIB,"" indicating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
6.  **I69298 (Other sequelae of other nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage):** The HPI mentions ""Prior IPH"" (Intracerebral Hemorrhage) and ""residual dizziness,"" specifying that the dizziness ""has been stable since his known cerebral hemorrhage."" This code captures the persistent neurological sequela of the prior hemorrhage.
7.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This code is not directly supported by the provided HPI excerpt. The patient denies symptoms often associated with GERD (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), but this does not confirm or deny the diagnosis itself. It is likely a pre-existing condition documented in the patient's comprehensive medical history.
8.  **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** The patient explicitly denies ""constipation/diarrhea"" in the HPI. Therefore, this code is not supported by the current symptoms. It is likely a pre-existing or historical issue documented in the patient's comprehensive medical history.
9.  **N529 (Male erectile dysfunction, unspecified):** This code is not mentioned or implied anywhere in the provided medical record excerpt. It is likely a pre-existing condition documented in the patient's comprehensive medical history.
10. **R42 (Dizziness and giddiness):** The patient reports ""persistent dizziness with positional changes"" as a current symptom that bothers him.
11. **Z5111 (Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy):** The Chief Complaint is ""Scheduled Chemotherapy,"" and the HPI states the patient ""presented for scheduled uptitration of venetoclax for TLS monitoring during dose adjustment"" and ""is being admitted for dose increase."" This code reflects the purpose of the encounter.
12. **Z86010 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of lymphoid, hematopoietic and related tissue):** The patient has a ""PMH of CLL,"" which is a malignant neoplasm of lymphoid tissue. This code documents the patient's personal history of this malignancy.
13. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This code is not mentioned or implied anywhere in the provided medical record excerpt. It is likely a pre-existing condition documented in the patient's comprehensive medical history.

1.  **M5117 (Other intervertebral disc displacement, lumbosacral region, with radiculopathy):**
    *   The Chief Complaint explicitly states ""lumbar radiculopathy.""
    *   The History of Present Illness (HPI) describes ""acute on chronic right lower extremity radiculopathy.""
    *   The HPI also mentions that an MRI ""demonstrated a large paracentral disc herniation at L5-S1,"" which is a common cause of radiculopathy in the lumbosacral region.
    *   Symptoms like ""numbness and tingling over her lateral right thigh and leg as well as upper inner thigh"" are characteristic signs of radiculopathy.
    *   The Major Surgical Procedure ""L5/S1 laminectomy discectomy"" directly addresses a disc herniation at L5-S1 causing radiculopathy.
    *   All these clinical details strongly support the assignment of M5117.

2.  **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):**
    *   The provided medical record snippet does not contain any information about the patient's history of nicotine dependence, smoking status, or tobacco use.

K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis): The chief complaint is ""abd pain"" (abdominal pain). Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition that frequently causes abdominal pain, especially in the upper abdomen. This code likely reflects a known chronic condition contributing to the patient's symptoms.

K830 (Obstruction of bile duct): The chief complaint is ""abd pain."" Obstruction of the bile duct (e.g., due to gallstones, strictures, or tumor) is a significant cause of abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right quadrant, and can lead to serious complications. This code indicates a specific anatomical and physiological problem in the biliary system identified during the patient's evaluation.

Z9049 (Acquired absence of other specified organs): This code indicates that the patient has undergone a surgical removal of an organ in the past. Although ""Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None"" is listed for the current encounter, this code refers to the patient's past medical history. Given the ""abd pain"" and ""obstruction of bile duct"" (K830), it is highly probable that the ""acquired absence"" refers to a previous surgical removal of an abdominal organ (e.g., spleen, part of the pancreas, or even the gallbladder if a more specific code like Z90.41 was not used for some reason) that is relevant to their overall abdominal health or might influence the current presentation of abdominal pain or biliary issues.

1.  **Z905 (Acquired absence of kidney):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has a ""prior nephrectomy in her infancy."" This directly corresponds to the acquired absence of a kidney.
2.  **I161 (Hypertensive urgency):** The Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness state that the patient ""presents from ___ clinic with hypertensive urgency.""
3.  **I151 (Hypertension secondary to other renal disorders):** Given the history of ""prior nephrectomy in her infancy,"" the current ""hypertensive urgency,"" ""elevated creatinine,"" and ""greater than 600 protein with red and white cells in the sediment,"" the hypertension is clearly linked to renal pathology.
4.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The lab results show ""elevated creatinine"" and ""greater than 600 protein with red and white cells in the sediment,"" indicating significant acute renal dysfunction or failure. The patient's symptoms of ""new ankle swelling"" and ""dyspnea on exertion"" are also consistent with fluid retention due to kidney failure.
5.  **M3214 (Glomerulonephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)):** The combination of ""elevated creatinine,"" ""leukopenia,"" ""anemia and elevated LDH with undetectable hemoglobin,"" and ""greater than 600 protein with red and white cells in the sediment"" strongly suggests an autoimmune process affecting the kidneys, characteristic of lupus nephritis (glomerulonephritis due to SLE). The presence of these multi-systemic findings points towards a diagnosis of SLE with renal involvement.
6.  **D591 (Autoimmune hemolytic anemia):** The lab findings of ""anemia and elevated LDH with undetectable hemoglobin"" strongly indicate hemolytic anemia. Given the overall picture pointing to SLE (M3214), this would be classified as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a common manifestation of SLE.
7.  **D594 (Other nonautoimmune hemolytic anemia):** While D591 covers the autoimmune component, it's possible that a nonautoimmune component of hemolytic anemia was also identified or suspected. For instance, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) can occur in severe hypertension or as part of thrombotic microangiopathies, which might coexist or be triggered in a patient with severe renal disease and hypertensive urgency. This code could capture that distinct, non-autoimmune aspect of hemolysis.

1.  **K8000 (Calculus of gallbladder with acute cholecystitis without obstruction):**
    *   The patient has a ""PMH of cholelithiasis,"" which directly translates to having gallstones (calculus of gallbladder).
    *   The chief complaint and presenting symptom is ""epigastric/RUQ abdominal pain"" for one day, which is a classic presentation of acute cholecystitis.
    *   The pain ""started following a dinner of cake, ice cream, and a single sausage,"" a fatty meal, which is a common trigger for gallbladder attacks, indicating an inflammatory response.
    *   The patient underwent a ""Laparoscopic cholecystectomy,"" a surgical procedure typically performed for symptomatic cholelithiasis, often in the context of acute cholecystitis.
    *   The medical record does not explicitly mention obstruction, making ""without obstruction"" appropriate.

2.  **K828 (Other specified diseases of gallbladder):**
    *   While K8000 covers the acute cholecystitis with gallstones, K828 is a broader code for ""other specified diseases of gallbladder."" Given the patient's ""PMH of cholelithiasis"" and the need for a ""Laparoscopic cholecystectomy,"" it's common to code for the underlying chronic or specified gallbladder disease that warranted surgical removal, even if the acute presentation is captured by K8000.

5.  **F1290 (Cannabis use, unspecified, uncomplicated)**: Directly corresponds to the patient's ""Endorses cocaine and marijuana use.""
6.  **I120 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with end stage renal disease)**: This code combines the patient's ""hypertension"" with ""ESRD on HD,"" indicating hypertensive chronic kidney disease that has progressed to end-stage.
7.  **R0789 (Other chest pain)**: Directly corresponds to the patient's ""Chief Complaint: chest pain"" and the detailed description of ""sudden onset chest pain radiating to arms & legs.""
8.  **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified)**: Corresponds to the initial vital signs showing a pulse of ""96,"" which is above the normal resting heart rate.
9.  **I5032 (Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure)**: This is inferred from the patient's symptoms of ""SOB with chest pain,"" elevated troponin ""trop 0.08,"" and a history of ""hypertension"" and ""ESRD,"" which are risk factors for heart failure. The ""acute on chronic"" nature suggests an exacerbation.
10. **B182 (Chronic viral hepatitis B without delta-agent)**: While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, this is a specific chronic condition that would be part of the patient's known medical history. Elevated AST (88) could be consistent with liver involvement.
11. **D649 (Anemia, unspecified)**: Anemia is a very common comorbidity in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), even if the hemoglobin (Hg 12.7) is not severely low at this specific measurement. This code would reflect a chronic condition.
12. **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, severe, uncomplicated)**: Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, but often present in patient history, especially with pulmonary or cardiovascular issues. This code would reflect a known history of nicotine dependence.
13. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)**: Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, but a common psychiatric comorbidity that would be part of a patient's known medical history.
14. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis)**: Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI regarding symptoms, but often a chronic condition coded in a patient's full medical record.
15. **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms)**: While the patient is a ""gentleman"" and ""dysuria"" is mentioned, N400 refers to BPH *without* LUTS. This code would reflect a known, chronic prostate condition.
Summary: The patient presented with acute chest pain and shortness of breath, experiencing an acute on chronic heart failure event, likely exacerbated by his numerous chronic conditions including HIV, ESRD on dialysis, hypertension, and substance abuse. Several other chronic conditions are also coded from his comprehensive medical history.

1.  **C099 (Malignant neoplasm of tonsil, unspecified):** This code indicates a primary diagnosis of tonsil cancer. Although not explicitly stated in the Chief Complaint or History of Present Illness (HPI), its presence in the ICD-10 list suggests it is a known underlying condition for the patient. A malignancy can contribute to systemic symptoms like fever.
2.  **D709 (Neutropenia, unspecified):** Neutropenia is a common complication in cancer patients, either due to the disease itself or as a side effect of chemotherapy/radiation. It increases susceptibility to infections, which would explain the patient's ""Fever"".
3.  **K9423 (Mechanical complication of gastrostomy device, infection and inflammation, initial encounter):** Given a diagnosis of tonsil cancer (C099), patients often experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), leading to the placement of a gastrostomy tube for nutrition. An infection or inflammation of this device could cause the reported ""Fever"" and ""Nausea"", and potentially ""Abdominal pain"" (R109).
4.  **R109 (Unspecified abdominal pain):** While ""abdominal pain"" is not explicitly in the chief complaint, ""nausea"" often accompanies it. Given the possibility of a gastrostomy tube complication (K9423) or systemic infection related to neutropenia (D709), abdominal discomfort is a plausible associated symptom.
5.  **R110 (Nausea):** Directly derived from the ""Chief Complaint: Nausea.""
6.  **R339 (Anuria and oliguria, unspecified):** Severe infection (e.g., from neutropenia or gastrostomy complication), dehydration from fever and nausea, or systemic complications can lead to acute kidney injury, which may manifest as reduced urine output (oliguria or anuria).
7.  **R5081 (Fever, other specified fever):** Directly derived from the ""Chief Complaint: Fever.""
8.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) & I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** These are common chronic cardiovascular comorbidities, especially in patients with a history of cancer or other risk factors (e.g., smoking, which is a risk factor for tonsil cancer). These conditions would be part of the patient's past medical history, even if not detailed in the brief HPI.
9.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a general code used to document other significant past medical history or risk factors that are not covered by more specific Z-codes. Given the presence of cancer and cardiovascular disease, there are likely other historical conditions (e.g., history of smoking, other chronic illnesses) that fall under this category.

*   **""s/p Ascending Aorta/hemiarch replacement, CABG, AVr""**: This indicates a history of significant cardiovascular disease and prior surgical interventions.
    *   **Z951** (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft): Directly corresponds to ""CABG"" (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft).
    *   **I2510** (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris): The underlying condition leading to CABG is typically atherosclerotic heart disease. ""Without angina pectoris"" fits as angina is not mentioned as a current chief complaint or symptom.
    *   **I083** (Rheumatic multiple valve diseases): While the specific etiology of the AVr (aortic valve replacement) is not explicitly stated, this code represents a history of multiple valve involvement, which often necessitates extensive cardiac surgery like AVr. It is a plausible underlying or historical condition for a patient undergoing such complex procedures.
*   **""He was edematous""**:
    *   **R609** (Edema, unspecified): Directly corresponds to the clinical finding of edema.
*   **""progressively erythema and pain at the right ___ site for the past week... purulent drainage from the ___ site... The wound was reportedly erythematous and indurated... Ultrasound was performed... It did reveal a hypoechoic collection- ?organizing hematoma vs. abscess""**: These clinical findings describe a surgical site infection at the vein harvest site in the right lower extremity.
    *   **L02415** (Cutaneous abscess, furuncle, and carbuncle of right lower limb): The ""hypoechoic collection - ?organizing hematoma vs. abscess"" with ""purulent drainage"" strongly suggests an abscess.
    *   **L03115** (Cellulitis of right lower limb): ""Progressive erythema and pain"" along with ""erythematous and indurated"" describes cellulitis, which often accompanies a localized abscess.
    *   **T814XXA** (Infection following a procedure, initial encounter): This code specifically denotes an infection as a complication of a procedure, fitting the ""purulent drainage from right lower extremity EVH site"" (Endoscopic Vein Harvest) post-CABG.
*   **""ID was consulted and broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated with Vanc, Cefepime and Flagyl""**: While the specific pathogen is not confirmed in the HPI, this empirical treatment and the nature of the infection suggest a common bacterial cause.
    *   **B9561** (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere): MSSA is a very common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, including surgical site infections. Given the use of antibiotics for the infection, this points to a bacterial etiology.
*   **""On ___ he presented for routine Pulmonology follow-up when he was instructed to seek care at the ___ ED for purulent drainage... He was admitted to ___.""**: This indicates the location where the acute complication was identified and further management was initiated.
    *   **Y92019** (Place of occurrence, hospital, unspecified): This code indicates the hospital (ED and admission) as the location where the patient was when the acute wound complication was identified and treated.
*   **""In regards to his Pulmonology appointment, he was diagnosed with COPD exacerbation""**:
    *   **J441** (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation): Directly corresponds to the diagnosis of ""COPD exacerbation.""
*   **General Medical History/Comorbidities (Inferred or from other parts of chart not in HPI but typically present in such patients):**
    *   **I10** (Essential (primary) hypertension): A very common chronic condition, especially in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease and requiring CABG.
    *   **E785** (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified): High cholesterol is a primary risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease (I2510) and is a very common comorbidity.
    *   **Z87891** (Personal history of nicotine dependence): A common risk factor and comorbidity for COPD and cardiovascular disease.
    *   **E669** (Obesity, unspecified) and **Z6831** (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult): These two codes together indicate the patient's obesity status. While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, BMI is a routinely measured and coded vital sign.
    *   **E039** (Hypothyroidism, unspecified): A common chronic endocrine disorder often seen in the general population, and likely present in the patient's full medical history.
    *   **K219** (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis): A common chronic gastrointestinal condition often present in a patient's general medical history.

1.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** The patient has a ""PMHx of papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy."" Thyroidectomy often leads to hypothyroidism.
2.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy):** The patient has ""PMHx of DMII"" and ""lab evidence of ___ on CKD."" This combination indicates diabetic nephropathy.
3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has ""PMHx of HLD.""
4.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** The patient has ""PMHx of OSA.""
5.  **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** The patient is described as ""mildly encephalopathic on evaluation,"" which is consistent with toxic encephalopathy.
6.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** The patient has ""PMHx of HTN"" and ""CKD."" This complex code reflects the combination of hypertension, kidney disease, and potential heart involvement.
7.  **I69322 (Hemiplegia and hemiparesis following cerebral infarction affecting left dominant side):** The patient has a ""PMHx of CVA."" This code specifies a common neurological sequela of a stroke.
8.  **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** The patient has ""PMHx of COPD.""
9.  **J9611 (Chronic respiratory failure with acute exacerbation):** The patient has ""COPD on 2L home oxygen,"" indicating chronic respiratory failure. The ""mildly encephalopathic"" state, combined with other acute issues, strongly suggests an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure.
10. **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** The chief complaint is ""leg pain,"" with reports of ""leg and buttock pain,"" and it was ""felt to be related to her lumbar spinal stenosis."" Dorsalgia is a general term for back and related pain.
11. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The patient had ""prerenal ___ on top of CKD"" during a recent admission, which represents acute kidney failure.
12. **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** The patient has ""CKD,"" and this code specifies a stage often seen in diabetic and hypertensive patients.
13. **R339 (Unspecified urinary retention):** The ""Course was also notable for urinary retention, and she was discharged with Foley in place.""
14. **Z86711 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid):** The patient has a ""PMHx of papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy.""
15. **Z9981 (Dependence on supplemental oxygen):** The patient is ""on 2L home oxygen.""

**Inferred Codes (not explicitly stated but plausible/common comorbidities in this clinical scenario):**
16. **B372 (Candidiasis of skin and nail) & B373 (Candidiasis of vulva and vagina):** While only ""lab evidence of UTI"" is mentioned, fungal infections are common in elderly, diabetic, and immunosuppressed patients, especially those with indwelling catheters (like a Foley for urinary retention). If these codes were assigned, it suggests other candidal infections were present.
17. **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories):** No information is provided about the patient's weight or BMI. However, obesity is a common comorbidity for patients with DMII, HTN, HLD, OSA, and COPD. Given as a code, it's assumed to be part of the patient's history.
18. **I248 (Other forms of acute ischemic heart disease):** Given the patient's significant cardiovascular risk factors (HTN, HLD, DMII, CKD), and the acute encephalopathic state, acute ischemic heart disease is a plausible comorbidity or acute event, even if not explicitly detailed as an MI or angina in this snippet.
19. **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure, moderate):** The code I130 (Hypertensive heart and CKD with heart failure) already implies heart failure. I50.32 specifies the type and severity of heart failure, which is common in patients with long-standing HTN and CKD.
20. **L309 (Dermatitis, unspecified):** No explicit mention of dermatitis in the provided text. It's a general code that could cover various skin irritations or conditions, often seen in elderly patients or those with poor hygiene/mobility.
21. **L89152 (Pressure ulcer of sacral region, stage 2):** Pressure ulcers are common in patients with limited mobility, especially those admitted to rehab facilities (""sent from rehab"") or with urinary retention (like this patient with a Foley).

4.  **E872 (Acidosis and other disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance, not elsewhere classified):** 實驗室檢查結果顯示「K 5.8」提示高血鉀 (hyperkalemia)，且動脈血氣分析 (VBG) 顯示「pH 7.33, pCO2 59」提示呼吸性酸中毒 (respiratory acidosis)。此代碼涵蓋了這些電解質和酸鹼平衡紊亂。
5.  **R338 (Other retention of urine):** 尿液分析顯示「UA w/few bacteria」。雖然這本身不直接診斷尿瀦留，但在老年男性患者中，結合有時會出現的尿路問題，且在ICD-10代碼列表中，提示其可能為病史中的一個問題或被推斷為當前尿液細菌的潛在原因。
6.  **N401 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms):** 結合 R338，前列腺增生 (BPH) 是老年男性尿瀦留的常見原因，因此即使病史中未直接提及，通常會根據患者性別和年齡，以及相關症狀/體徵推斷為共病。
7.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** 儘管本次血紅蛋白 (Hgb) 為 13.0 正常，但在患有轉移性癌症的患者中，貧血是非常常見的共病，因此這可能是病患長期病史中的一個代碼。
8.  **E538 (Deficiency of other specified B group vitamins):** 患有晚期癌症和食慾不振/嗜睡的患者，維生素缺乏症是常見的，可能是患者病史中的營養狀況問題。
9.  **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** 未在當前病史中明確提及，但鑑於患者有多種其他神經系統問題（如共濟失調、轉移性癌症的潛在腦轉移風險），癲癇可能為其既往病史中的一個診斷。
10. **G43909 (Migraine, unspecified, not intractable, without status migrainosus):** 未在當前病史中明確提及，可能為患者的既往病史。
11. **G500 (Trigeminal neuralgia):** 未在當前病史中明確提及，可能為患者的既往病史中的一個神經系統疾病。
12. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** 未在當前病史中明確提及，但胃食管反流病 (GERD) 在有反覆吸入性肺炎病史的患者中非常常見，通常被視為引起或加重吸入性風險的共病。
13. **Z8701 (Personal history of tobacco dependence):** 未在當前病史中明確提及，但對於有肺部問題（如吸入性肺炎）和癌症的患者來說，有吸煙史是常見的風險因素，因此會被編碼。

1.  **F312 (Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features)**: 病史中明確提及「history of bipolar disorder」。患者當前症狀包括「tangential and disorganized」思維過程，以及因壓力導致的「complete breakdown」和「poor sleep」，這些均符合躁鬱症躁狂或混合發作的表現。此處無明確幻覺或妄想描述，故為「without psychotic features」。
2.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified)**: 患者因「custody hearing」的壓力而感到「feeling sad and having a 'complete breakdown' last week」，這種壓力反應可能包含顯著的焦慮成分，因此可歸類為未明示的焦慮症。
3.  **F4310 (Post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified)**: 病史中提到患者曾有「abusive ex-husband」和「another abusive ex-partner」的經歷。雖然病歷未明確診斷PTSD或詳述其症狀，但虐待史是PTSD的顯著風險因素，此代碼可能反映其既往或潛在診斷。
4.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric) (unspecified))**: 病史中明確指出患者的「medical history notable for OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea)」，且主訴為「sleep deprivation」，與此診斷相符。
5.  **Z635 (Disruption of family by separation or divorce)**: 患者是一位「divorced woman」，病史中提及「abusive ex-husband」和「another abusive ex-partner」，以及她因法庭判決「he was awarded custody of her youngest daughter」且「other minor child... is currently living with his father and stepmother」。這些情況都直接描述了因分居或離婚造成的家庭關係中斷。

以下ICD-10代碼在提供的病歷摘要中沒有明確的直接證據支持，可能來自病患更完整的病史記錄：
6.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: 在提供的病歷摘要中沒有明確提及高血脂症。此診斷可能來自患者更廣泛的醫療史。
7.  **G43909 (Migraine, unspecified, not intractable, without status migrainosus)**: 在提供的病歷摘要中沒有明確提及偏頭痛。此診斷可能來自患者更廣泛的醫療史。
8.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, without status asthmaticus)**: 在提供的病歷摘要中沒有明確提及哮喘。此診斷可能來自患者更廣泛的醫療史。
9.  **K521 (Toxic gastroenteritis and colitis)**: 提供的病歷摘要中沒有提及任何胃腸炎或結腸炎的症狀（如腹瀉、腹痛）或診斷。

12. **Y92239 (Residential institution as the place of occurrence)**: 患者有「recent discharge from」精神病院的歷史。然而，病史指出她因當前主訴「self presented to ___ ED」。此代碼通常指事件（例如，病情惡化、受傷或導致當前就診的誘發因素）發生在住院機構內，這與她自行前往急診的描述不完全吻合。它可能與她之前的住院經歷有關。
13. **Z9114 (Patient's noncompliance with other medical treatment and regimen)**: 病史提及患者「previously on lithium」。雖然躁鬱症患者常見服藥依從性問題，但提供的病歷摘要中並未明確說明患者目前對任何藥物治療或方案不依從。
14. **Z91410 (Personal history of abuse in childhood, unspecified)**: 患者報告有「abusive ex-husband」和「another abusive ex-partner」，這指的是成人關係中的虐待。然而，ICD-10代碼Z91.410特指「Personal history of abuse *in childhood*（童年受虐史）」，這在提供的病歷摘要中沒有明確說明或暗示。

History of Present Illness:
Ms ___ is an ___ year old woman with afib on lovenox, HTN,
gout and recent diagnosis of MM/amyloidosis with one week of
nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite who is admitted from
clinic in setting of hyperkalemia. 

Ms ___ was hospitalized at ___ from ___ in 
setting
of right hip fracture s/p internal fixation, found to have
MM/amyloidosis and is s/p dexamethasone and initiation of 
Velcade
(Bortezomib, 26S Proteosome inhibitor). Seen in clinic with Dr.
___ on ___, where she was noted to have achieved a
significant reduction in light chains from 6000 --> 1000, and
received her dose of Velcade. At that time they held off on
giving Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide, DNA crosslinker) given her
excellent response, with the plan to start xgeva (Denosumab,
RANKL inhibitor) in the coming weeks. 

Since her Velcade last week ___, she has been nauseated and 
has
decreased appetite. She vomited ___ and ___, and
since then has had greatly decreased intake. She also reports
nasal congestion, intermittently coughing, but now with less
sputum.

When she returned to ___ clinic today for her follow-up
appointment and Velcade, in addition to the above symptoms, she
was noted to have hyperkalemia to 6.3 (repeat 6.2 not 
hemolyzed),
as well as ___ with creatinine 1.3 from baseline 0.7 -0.9, 
BUN
73 and hyponatremia to 127. EKG showed afib without peaked T

1.  **C9000 (Multiple myeloma without mention of remission) & E854 (Organ-limited amyloidosis):** These codes are directly supported by ""recent diagnosis of MM/amyloidosis."" Multiple myeloma is a common cause of amyloidosis.
2.  **I43 (Cardiomyopathy in diseases classified elsewhere):** Amyloidosis often affects the heart, leading to cardiac amyloidosis and cardiomyopathy. This code links directly to the diagnosis of ""MM/amyloidosis"" (E85.4).
3.  **I4891 (Atrial fibrillation, unspecified):** Directly stated as ""afib on lovenox.""
4.  **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Directly stated as ""afib on lovenox"" (Lovenox is an anticoagulant).
5.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with (congestive) heart failure):** Supported by ""HTN"" and the presence of ""I5023"" for heart failure, indicating a chronic hypertensive background leading to cardiac dysfunction.
6.  **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** This indicates an exacerbation of underlying heart failure, consistent with a chronically ill patient experiencing acute renal failure and electrolyte imbalances, and potentially fluid retention suggested by ""little urine output.""
7.  **M1A9XX1 (Gout, unspecified, without tophus (gouty nodule), unspecified site):** Directly stated as ""gout.""
8.  **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Directly stated as ""hyperkalemia to 6.3 (repeat 6.2 not hemolyzed).""
9.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Supported by ""creatinine 1.3 from baseline 0.7 -0.9, BUN 73"" and ""little urine output.""
10. **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** Directly stated as ""hyponatremia to 127.""
11. **E872 (Acidosis):** Supported by ""VBG showed metabolic acidosis pH 7.28 pCO2 44 bicarb 22.""
12. **E861 (Volume depletion):** Supported by ""one week of nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite,"" ""greatly decreased intake.""
13. **J069 (Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified):** Supported by ""nasal congestion, intermittently coughing, but now with less sputum.""
14. **K210 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease with esophagitis):** While not explicitly stated, ""Nausea and vomiting"" is the chief complaint. GERD with esophagitis is a common chronic condition that can cause these symptoms, making it a plausible co-diagnosis in an older patient.
15. **K921 (Melena):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, given severe GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting) and anticoagulant use (""lovenox""), melena (black tarry stools indicating upper GI bleed) might have been identified through stool occult blood tests or endoscopy, not detailed in this HPI excerpt.
16. **L89152 (Pressure ulcer of sacral region, stage 2):** Directly stated as ""chronic ulcer on her sacrum."" Stage 2 is a common default stage if not further specified.
17. **M80051D (Age-related osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, right femur, subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing):** Supported by ""right hip fracture s/p internal fixation, found to have MM/amyloidosis."" Multiple myeloma frequently causes pathological fractures due to bone involvement, and ""s/p internal fixation"" indicates a healed or healing fracture.
18. **S8011XA (Contusion of right thigh, initial encounter):** A hip fracture typically results from a fall or trauma, and a contusion of the adjacent thigh is a common accompanying soft tissue injury at the time of the initial injury (""initial encounter"").
19. **T8149XA (Other complications of procedure, not elsewhere classified, initial encounter) & Y831 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** These codes suggest a complication from the prior ""internal fixation"" surgery. While the specific complication is not detailed in the HPI, the ongoing presence of these codes implies a documented procedural complication.
20. **B9562 (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) & B9729 (Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The HPI mentions ""Sent blood cultures, swab for flu,"" indicating a workup for infection. While results are not in the HPI, these organism codes imply that such infections were identified, either from this admission's labs or prior history within the full medical record.
21. **L03115 (Cellulitis of right lower limb):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI. However, patients with chronic conditions, immobility, and a sacral ulcer are at high risk for skin infections like cellulitis, which could have been identified on physical examination during admission.
22. **M1990 (Unspecified osteoarthritis, unspecified site):** A common chronic condition in elderly patients. While ""gout"" is mentioned, osteoarthritis may be an additional, general chronic problem listed in the patient's full medical history.
23. **F4321 (Adjustment disorder with depressed mood):** This is a common code assigned to patients facing significant stressors such as a new, severe diagnosis like MM/amyloidosis, ongoing intensive treatments, and acute severe illness, leading to emotional distress.
24. **W228XXA (Other contact with other sharp object, initial encounter):** This external cause code is not directly supported by the HPI. It might relate to an unmentioned minor injury during her rehabilitation stay or related to medical equipment/procedures.
25. **Y92230 (Other hospital administrative areas as the place of occurrence) & Y9289 (Other specified place as the place of occurrence):** These are place of occurrence codes. The patient was admitted from clinic to the hospital floor, implying various locations within the hospital system where events or assessments took place. Y92.230 is specific and might refer to an event in an administrative part of the hospital, while Y92.89 is a more generic ""other specified place.""
26. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** This critical code status is not mentioned in the HPI but would be a part of the patient's advanced directives in their full medical chart.

Summary: The patient is an elderly woman with multiple myeloma/amyloidosis (C9000, E854, I43) and several chronic conditions including hypertension (I110), atrial fibrillation (I4891, Z7902), gout (M1A9XX1, M1990), and a history of a pathological hip fracture (M80051D, S8011XA, T8149XA, Y831). She was admitted for an acute exacerbation characterized by severe nausea and vomiting (K210, K921), leading to volume depletion (E861), acute kidney failure (N179), and severe electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia E875, hyponatremia E871, acidosis E872). She also presented with an acute upper respiratory infection (J069), an acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation (I5023), and has a chronic sacral pressure ulcer (L89152) and potential other infections (B9562, B9729, L03115). Her complex medical situation and new diagnosis also indicate an adjustment disorder (F4321), and her code status is DNR (Z66). Her care involves various hospital locations (Y92230, Y9289).

1.  **I671 (Cerebral aneurysm, nonruptured):** This code directly corresponds to the chief complaint and the history of present illness: ""Left ICA Aneurysm"" and ""Imaging revealed a Left ICA aneurysm."" This is the primary diagnosis for which the patient is undergoing the procedure.
2.  **G40109 (Localization-related (focal) (partial) symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with simple partial seizures, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** The patient presented with a ""recent work up for episode of Left side tingling."" Tingling, especially unilateral, can be a sensory manifestation of a focal seizure, which could have been the symptom that led to the imaging and discovery of the aneurysm.
3.  **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** While not explicitly stated in the provided snippet of the HPI, nicotine dependence is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of cerebral aneurysms and other vascular diseases. It is common practice to code significant past medical history, such as nicotine dependence, when relevant to the patient's current condition, especially in the context of vascular neurosurgery.
4.  **E0590 (Thyrotoxicosis, unspecified, without thyrotoxic crisis or storm):** This code indicates a past or current diagnosis of an unspecified form of hyperthyroidism. While not detailed in this specific medical record snippet, it represents a comorbidity or past medical history that is relevant to the patient's overall health status and may influence management, even if stable.
5.  **E559 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified):** This code indicates a past or current diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency. This is a very common comorbidity, particularly in older individuals, and is often documented as part of a patient's comprehensive medical record even if not directly related to the chief complaint for this specific visit.
6.  **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** This code refers to a past or current diagnosis of unspecified low blood pressure. It could be a recorded finding from previous visits, a chronic condition, or a medication-induced side effect that is part of the patient's overall medical profile.
7.  **M329 (Systemic lupus erythematosus, unspecified):** This code indicates a past or current diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease. SLE is a significant chronic condition that can affect various organ systems, including neurological and vascular systems, and its presence is important for comprehensive patient care, even if stable and not the primary reason for this admission.

1.  **K614 (Ischiorectal abscess):** The medical record explicitly states ""Incision and drainage of perirectal abscess"" and an ""MRI pelvis done in the ED demonstrated ___ phlegmom."" An ischiorectal abscess is a specific type of perirectal abscess.
2.  **W000XXA (Fall on ice, initial encounter):** The patient ""states the rectal pain started about 5 days ago following a slip and fall on ice when he landed on his buttocks."" This directly corresponds to the external cause of the injury. ""XXA"" denotes an initial encounter for treatment.
3.  **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The record mentions ""fall on ice,"" but the specific location (e.g., home, street, workplace) where the fall occurred is not provided. Therefore, an unspecified place code is used.
4.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** The HPI states the patient was ""found to have hyperglycemia (glucose 471) consistent with a new diagnosis of diabetes."" This directly supports the diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes with hyperglycemia.
5.  **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** With a ""new diagnosis of diabetes"" and being ""given IV morphine, 8U insulin,"" it indicates that insulin therapy has been initiated and is expected to be long-term management for his diabetes.
6.  **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism):** The patient presented with ""leukocytosis"" and a severe infection (perirectal abscess) that required admission for ""antibiotics."" While ""sepsis"" is not explicitly stated as a definitive diagnosis, these findings (systemic inflammatory response and severe infection) often lead to the consideration or diagnosis of sepsis, especially when the organism isn't specified.
7.  **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** The MRI revealed a ""phlegmom likely associated with fissure."" Perirectal abscesses and anal fissures are commonly linked to or exacerbated by constipation, even if not explicitly mentioned as a primary symptom. It's a plausible underlying or contributing factor.
8.  **Z6834 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-34.9, adult):** Although not stated in the provided HPI, BMI is a standard part of patient assessment during admission. This code indicates the patient's BMI was in the range of 30.0-34.9, classifying them as Obesity Class I.
9.  **E663 (Overweight due to excess calories):** A BMI of 30.0-34.9 (Z6834) falls under obesity. E66.3 is a general code for overweight/obesity often used when the specific type of obesity is not detailed, capturing the patient's general weight status.

Summary: The patient presented with a perirectal abscess following a fall on ice, also diagnosed with new-onset Type 2 Diabetes with hyperglycemia. The codes reflect the infection (abscess, sepsis), the external cause and circumstances of the fall, the metabolic disorder (diabetes, insulin use, overweight), and a related gastrointestinal condition (constipation).

1.  **N3000 (Acute cystitis without hematuria):** This code is directly supported by the Chief Complaint ""Dysuria,"" which is a primary symptom of cystitis (bladder inflammation).
2.  **C8299 (Follicular lymphoma, unspecified, unspecified site):** This is a malignant neoplasm code. Although not mentioned in the Chief Complaint or the provided (empty) History of Present Illness, it represents a significant, pre-existing or current cancer diagnosis that would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical record.
3.  **K8020 (Calculus of gallbladder with other cholecystitis with obstruction, without mention of gangrene or perforation):** This code indicates a diagnosis of gallstones with associated inflammation and obstruction. Similar to the lymphoma, this is a significant comorbidity that is assumed to be part of the patient's medical history, even though it is not detailed in the brief HPI snippet.
4.  **Q644 (Malformation of ureter):** This code represents a congenital anomaly of the ureter. As a permanent structural condition, it would be part of the patient's medical history. It could potentially predispose the patient to urinary tract issues, which aligns with the chief complaint of dysuria (N3000).
5.  **R791 (Abnormal coagulation profile):** This code indicates an abnormal finding in blood coagulation tests. This is a current clinical finding that could be related to the patient's underlying follicular lymphoma (C8299) or the need for anticoagulant therapy.
6.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** This code signifies that the patient is currently on anticoagulant medication. This is a current medication status, which is consistent with the presence of an abnormal coagulation profile (R791) and a personal history of blood clots (Z86711, Z86718).
7.  **Z8249 (Family history of ischemic heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system):** This code captures relevant family medical history. While not directly linked to the chief complaint, it's a standard Z-code for recording inherited risks.
8.  **Z86711 (Personal history of thrombophlebitis):** This code indicates a past history of inflammation of a vein due to a blood clot.
9.  **Z86718 (Personal history of other venous thrombosis and embolism):** This code indicates a past history of other types of blood clots in veins or a pulmonary embolism. Both Z86711 and Z86718 are highly relevant as patients with cancer (C8299) have an increased risk of thrombotic events, and these histories are consistent with the long-term use of anticoagulants (Z7901).
10. **Z87440 (Personal history of diseases of urinary tract, unspecified):** This code indicates a past history of unspecified diseases of the urinary tract. This aligns well with the current chief complaint of dysuria (N3000), the presence of a ureteral malformation (Q644), and the patient's allergies to multiple antibiotics commonly used for urinary tract infections (Cipro, Sulfa, Nitrofurantoin), all suggesting a history of recurrent or chronic urinary issues.

*   **K8510 (Gallstone pancreatitis):** The medical record explicitly states the patient ""found to have concerns for acute gallstone pancreatitis"" and ""found to have acute pancreatitis with elevated LFTs."" This directly supports the code.
*   **K8020 (Calculus of gallbladder with acute cholecystitis without obstruction):** The patient has a ""PMH cholelithiasis"" and ""known cholelithiasis with biliary colic for approximately ___ year. Worsening episodes in the last few months."" While the ""RUQ u/s negative for cholecystitis"" is noted, the presence of symptomatic gallstones causing recurrent acute episodes (biliary colic) and leading to complications like pancreatitis often warrants a code for symptomatic cholelithiasis. In some clinical coding practices, severe, recurrent biliary colic, particularly when leading to intervention (Laparoscopic cholecystectomy), might be captured under a code that includes acute inflammation of the gallbladder, even if overt cholecystitis is not evident on ultrasound. This code reflects the underlying gallstone disease that necessitated the surgery and led to pancreatitis.
*   **K828 (Other specified diseases of gallbladder):** The patient's history of ""known cholelithiasis with biliary colic for approximately ___ year"" and ""worsening episodes"" indicates chronic, problematic gallbladder disease. This code can be used to capture other specific, chronic conditions of the gallbladder, such as chronic inflammation or dysfunction, that contribute to the formation of gallstones and symptoms, leading to the eventual cholecystectomy, beyond just the acute stones or cholecystitis.
*   **F410 (Panic disorder without agoraphobia):** The patient reports ""+dizziness but no syncope."" Dizziness is a common somatic symptom of anxiety or panic attacks. Given the acute and stressful medical situation (acute pancreatitis, hospitalization, impending surgery), it is plausible that the patient experienced anxiety symptoms, and this code reflects a clinical diagnosis of panic disorder.
*   **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** Although not explicitly stated, insomnia is a very common issue for hospitalized patients, especially those experiencing acute pain (""RUQ abd pain""), anxiety, or undergoing a major surgical procedure. This code likely represents a documented sleep disturbance during the patient's hospital stay.
*   **R339 (Unspecified retention of urine):** This code is not mentioned in the provided HPI. However, urinary retention is a frequent complication in hospitalized patients, particularly those undergoing surgery (like Laparoscopic cholecystectomy), receiving certain medications, or experiencing acute illness. Its inclusion indicates it was a documented clinical finding or issue during the patient's admission.

1.  **D638 (Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere):** Anemia is a common complication of both ""stage IV CKD"" (chronic kidney disease) and ""ETOH cirrhosis"" (end-stage liver disease). Although not explicitly stated, its presence is highly probable in this patient's complex medical profile.
2.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is a known complication of ""ETOH cirrhosis"" due to hypersplenism or bone marrow suppression.
3.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** This code directly corresponds to the patient's history of ""DMII"" (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) and ""stage IV CKD"" (Chronic Kidney Disease).
4.  **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** The medical record explicitly states, ""Sodium was noted to be 133"" and ""low sodium levels (she says her doctor told it was key to fix electrolytes),"" which indicates hyponatremia.
5.  **E874 (Other disorders of acid-base balance):** The patient's severe chronic conditions, including ""stage IV CKD,"" ""ETOH cirrhosis,"" ""sCHF"" (systolic congestive heart failure), and ""toxic-metabolic encephalopathy,"" significantly increase the likelihood of various acid-base disturbances (e.g., metabolic acidosis in CKD or liver failure).
6.  **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) is a common electrolyte imbalance associated with advanced ""stage IV CKD"" and often acute kidney injury (N17.9 is also coded).
7.  **F1021 (Alcohol dependence with intoxication, uncomplicated):** The patient's history of ""ETOH cirrhosis"" strongly implies chronic alcohol dependence. ""Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy on prior hospitalizations"" could be related to periods of intoxication or withdrawal, and the ""uncomplicated"" modifier suggests no severe withdrawal symptoms like delirium tremens.
8.  **F1120 (Opioid dependence, uncomplicated):** The medical record explicitly states the patient is ""on chronic opioids,"" indicating opioid dependence.
9.  **G8929 (Chronic pain, unspecified):** The patient's statement of ""MSK pain on chronic opioids"" and ""leg pain was present for a few days and then it got worse"" supports a diagnosis of chronic pain.
10. **G9340 (Encephalopathy, unspecified):** The patient's ""difficulty reporting her medical history,"" being ""confused or unsure,"" and a history of ""toxic-metabolic encephalopathy on prior hospitalizations"" support this diagnosis.
11. **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This comprehensive code perfectly encapsulates the patient's ""HTN"" (hypertension), ""sCHF"" (systolic congestive heart failure), and ""stage IV CKD"" (chronic kidney disease).
12. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** This code reflects the patient's ""history of CAD"" (Coronary Artery Disease). The ""without angina pectoris"" modifier is used as no current angina is reported in the chief complaint or HPI.
13. **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** The patient's history of ""CAD s/p PCI"" (Coronary Artery Disease status post Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) strongly suggests a history of myocardial infarction, as PCI is typically performed after such an event. Also, ""punctate foci of microhemorrhage consistent with chronic hypertensive disease"" can be sequelae of prior ischemic events.
14. **I2720 (Pulmonary hypertension, unspecified):** Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication of severe ""sCHF"" and ""stage IV CKD."" The patient's reported ""difficulty with her breathing over last week"" could be a symptom of worsening pulmonary hypertension.
15. **I340 (Nonrheumatic mitral valve insufficiency):** Functional mitral regurgitation (insufficiency) is a common finding in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to ""sCHF"" (systolic congestive heart failure) due to ventricular remodeling.
16. **I5023 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, unspecified):** This code directly reflects the patient's ""sCHF"" (systolic congestive heart failure).
17. **K5090 (Crohn's disease, unspecified, without complications):** There is no direct evidence for Crohn's disease in the provided medical record summary. Its inclusion suggests it is part of the patient's complete past medical history that was not detailed in this specific HPI excerpt, or it might be related to other unmentioned gastrointestinal symptoms or findings.
18. **K7030 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver, without ascites):** This code directly reflects the patient's ""ETOH cirrhosis."" The ""without ascites"" modifier is assumed as ascites is not mentioned.
19. **K861 (Alcoholic pancreatitis, chronic):** Chronic pancreatitis is a well-known complication of chronic alcohol abuse, which is evidenced by the patient's ""ETOH cirrhosis.""
20. **M069 (Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, ""MSK pain on chronic opioids"" indicates a significant chronic musculoskeletal disorder. Rheumatoid arthritis is a common systemic cause of chronic pain in this patient population.
21. **M25572 (Pain in left ankle and foot):** Although the HPI describes pain ""diffusely from thighs to feet"" and ""bilateral lower extremity pain,"" this specific code indicates that pain in the left ankle and foot was either a particularly prominent symptom, or specifically documented during a more detailed physical examination not fully captured in this summary.
22. **M5030 (Other cervical disc degeneration, unspecified region):** Similar to other chronic musculoskeletal codes, cervical disc degeneration is a common age-related condition that could contribute to the patient's overall ""MSK pain"" and use of chronic opioids, even if not explicitly mentioned in the lower extremity pain context.
23. **M7918 (Myalgia, other site):** This code covers the patient's ""bilateral lower extremity pain/swelling"" and ""Pain diffusely from thighs to feet.""
24. **M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture):** Osteoporosis is a common age-related condition, especially in elderly women, and can be exacerbated by chronic alcohol abuse and other severe chronic illnesses mentioned in the patient's history.
25. **M8580 (Other specified disorders of bone density and structure, unspecified site):** Chronic kidney disease (""stage IV CKD"") and ""ETOH cirrhosis"" can lead to various metabolic bone disorders (e.g., renal osteodystrophy, bone demineralization) that affect bone density and structure.
26. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** While the patient has ""stage IV CKD"" (chronic), severe systemic illness, hyponatremia, and ""toxic-metabolic encephalopathy"" can precipitate an acute exacerbation of kidney function, leading to acute kidney failure (acute on chronic kidney injury).
27. **N184 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 (severe)):** This code directly reflects the patient's ""stage IV CKD.""
28. **N2581 (Other disorders of renal tubule and cortical necrosis):** This specific code for tubular or cortical necrosis indicates a more severe form of acute kidney injury (N17.9) often seen in critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities and electrolyte disturbances.
29. **Z7902 (Long-term (current) use of opioid analgesic):** This code directly supports the patient being ""on chronic opioids.""
30. **Z794 (Long-term (current) use of insulin):** Given the patient's ""DMII"" and ""stage IV CKD,"" long-term insulin therapy is a very common and often necessary treatment for glycemic control, even if not explicitly mentioned in this summary.
31. **Z8614 (Personal history of abuse of alcohol):** This is supported by the patient's ""ETOH cirrhosis"" and the diagnosis of alcohol dependence (F10.21).
32. **Z86711 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** The CT head findings of ""subtle loss of the gray-white matter differentiation in the left frontal lobe that may be related to a subacute infarction,"" even if MRI showed no *acute* ischemia, suggests a prior cerebral infarction.
33. **Z8711 (Personal history of diseases of the genitourinary system):** This general code is appropriate for the patient's ""stage IV CKD"" (chronic kidney disease).
34. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This code can be used for the patient's ""toxic-metabolic encephalopathy on prior hospitalizations.""
35. **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** This code directly reflects the patient's status ""s/p PCI"" (status post Percutaneous Coronary Intervention).

1.  **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism):** The chief complaint is ""Septic shock,"" and the patient presented with ""acute onset chills and fever to 102.8,"" was ""hypotensive,"" and treated with ""zosyn"" (an antibiotic). This directly indicates sepsis.
2.  **E2740 (Unspecified adrenocortical insufficiency):** The patient was given ""a stress dose of hydrocortisone"" in the ED for ""labile BP"" in the context of septic shock, which is a common intervention for relative adrenal insufficiency during severe sepsis.
3.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** This is a common comorbidity that would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history, even if not explicitly detailed in the provided brief history of present illness.
4.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** This is a common psychiatric comorbidity that would be part of the patient's full medical record. The patient being ""pleasant, talking"" in the ED does not rule out a history of depression.
5.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Similar to F329, anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric comorbidity likely present in the patient's medical history.
6.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** This condition is often associated with obesity (E669) and chronic respiratory issues (J449), making it a likely comorbidity in the patient's history.
7.  **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** While the patient denied acute pain in the ED, ""TBM s/p Tracheobronchoplasty"" (Tracheobronchomalacia post-surgery) could be associated with chronic discomfort or pain, or it could refer to other chronic pain not specified in this brief excerpt.
8.  **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** The patient's presentation with ""acute onset chills and fever to 102.8,"" ""hypoxic,"" the use of ""zosyn,"" and undergoing ""Fiberoptic bronchoscopy"" strongly suggests an acute respiratory infection like pneumonia as the likely source of sepsis.
9.  **J398 (Other specified diseases of upper respiratory tract):** The patient's history includes ""TBM"" (Tracheobronchomalacia), which is a disease affecting the tracheobronchial tree and fits this category.
10. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** The presence of ""TBM s/p Tracheobronchoplasty"" and ongoing ""hypoxia"" with oxygen requirements (""satting in the low 90's on 5L O2"") indicates a significant chronic lung disease, for which COPD is a common and appropriate general code.
11. **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** Unspecified back pain is a very common condition, likely captured from the patient's full medical history.
12. **M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture):** This is a common condition in older females, particularly those with chronic health issues and potential long-term steroid use (Z7902), and would be part of the patient's full medical record.
13. **R6521 (Severe sepsis with septic shock):** The chief complaint ""Septic shock"" and the patient's presentation with ""hypotensive"" directly fulfill the criteria for this code.
14. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of systemic steroids):** The administration of a ""stress dose of hydrocortisone"" and the likely diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (E2740) suggest either chronic systemic steroid use or a medical condition requiring it, thus justifying this code.
15. **Z7982 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** Not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI, but this code indicates a history of diabetes, which is a common comorbidity and would be part of the patient's full medical history.
16. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This is a very common comorbidity for patients with chronic lung conditions like Tracheobronchomalacia (J398) and COPD (J449).

1.  **S12110A (Nondisplaced Type II dens fracture, initial encounter for closed fracture):** Directly corresponds to the finding of ""a C2 fracture"" after the fall. The ""A"" indicates an initial encounter for this injury.
2.  **S42294A (Unspecified displaced fracture of surgical neck of right humerus, initial encounter for closed fracture):** Directly corresponds to the finding of ""a proximal humerus fracture"" after the fall. The ""Right shoulder"" in the chief complaint supports the laterality. The ""A"" indicates an initial encounter for this injury.
3.  **S0083XA (Other superficial injuries of other part of head, initial encounter):** Corresponds to the patient stating ""She struck her head"" during the fall. The ""XA"" indicates an initial encounter for this injury.
4.  **W1830XA (Fall on same level due to slipping, tripping and stumbling without subsequent striking against object, initial encounter):** Corresponds to the description of the event: ""had a witnessed fall... She describes leaning on a table with wheels, which slipped out from underneath her and caused her to fall from standing."" This details the mechanism of injury. The ""XA"" indicates an initial encounter.
5.  **Y92129 (Assisted living facility as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** Directly corresponds to the event occurring ""at her assisted living facility.""
6.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Directly corresponds to the history of ""on coumadin for AF."" ""AF"" refers to Atrial Fibrillation.
7.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Directly corresponds to the patient being ""on coumadin,"" which is an anticoagulant.
8.  **M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture):** Inferred due to an elderly patient suffering significant fractures (C2 and humerus) from a ""fall from standing,"" which suggests underlying bone fragility consistent with age-related osteoporosis.
9.  **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** While the chief complaint mentions acute pain, given the nature of the fractures and the need for ""further workup,"" chronic pain (either pre-existing or anticipated due to significant injuries) is a plausible diagnosis from the patient's full medical history.
10. **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy), E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified), E1151 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy with ulcer):** These multiple codes for Type 2 Diabetes and its complications indicate a known history of this condition, even if not explicitly detailed in the brief HPI. These would be sourced from the patient's full medical record.
11. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** Given the diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes (E11.xx codes), long-term insulin use is a common treatment and would be coded from the patient's full medical record.
12. **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease) & N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** These are common comorbidities, especially in elderly patients with diabetes. They would be part of the patient's known medical history.

15. **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** A common condition in elderly patients, especially with chronic diseases or those on anticoagulants like Coumadin. It would be coded from the patient's full medical record.
16. **E559 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified):** Common in elderly populations and can contribute to bone health issues, potentially linking to osteoporosis. It would be coded from the patient's full medical record.
17. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** A common comorbidity in the elderly, coded from the patient's full medical record.
18. **I5032 (Acute on chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** Given the patient's age and comorbidities (AF, diabetes, hypertension), heart failure is a common associated condition. It would be coded from the patient's full medical record.
19. **M109 (Gout, unspecified):** A common comorbidity in the elderly, coded from the patient's full medical record.
20. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** A common mental health condition often co-occurring with chronic physical illnesses, coded from the patient's full medical record.
21. **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** This indicates a past history of breast cancer and is part of the patient's significant medical history, coded from the full medical record.

1.  **N993 (Prolapse of vaginal vault after hysterectomy):** The chief complaint is ""pelvic organ prolapse."" The history describes the ""bulge is hanging between her legs, makes her sore. She has difficulty walking."" This indicates severe prolapse. The planned ""colpocleisis"" is a surgical procedure specifically performed for severe vaginal vault prolapse, often in patients who have had a hysterectomy (even if not explicitly stated in this snippet) or for whom other reconstructive options are not suitable. This code, therefore, represents the specific type of pelvic organ prolapse the patient is experiencing and for which she is undergoing surgery.
2.  **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** The medical record explicitly states, ""She cannot take estrogen due to history of breast cancer."" This directly supports the assignment of this code.
3.  **C9110 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type not having achieved remission):** This code is a distinct hematological malignancy. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI, it may represent a separate, established diagnosis from the patient's full medical history.
4.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** This code refers to a low platelet count. While not explicitly mentioned, it could be a comorbidity, a side effect of prior treatments (e.g., chemotherapy for breast cancer), or an incidental finding from the patient's comprehensive medical workup.
5.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** This code indicates an underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism is a very common comorbidity, particularly in older female patients, and would likely be part of her established medical history.
6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This code indicates high blood pressure. Hypertension is another extremely common comorbidity, especially in older patients, and would typically be part of a patient's comprehensive medical history.
7.  **J479 (Bronchiectasis, unspecified):** This code refers to a chronic lung condition. While not directly mentioned in the HPI, it could be an existing respiratory comorbidity in an older patient.
8.  **M8580 (Other specified disorders of bone density and structure, unspecified site):** This code relates to bone density or structure issues. While not explicitly detailed, in an older female patient, especially one with a history of breast cancer (which can involve hormonal treatments affecting bone density), bone issues like osteoporosis are common comorbidities. ""Difficulty walking"" and ""sore"" due to the prolapse might also be accompanied by or exacerbated by underlying musculoskeletal or bone conditions.
9.  **Z85828 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of skin):** This code indicates a personal history of skin cancer. A patient with one type of cancer (breast cancer) often has a personal history of other malignancies, including common skin cancers, which would be noted in their full medical record.

1.  **Chief Complaint Analysis:**
    *   **""v-tach"" (Ventricular tachycardia):** This directly explains **I472** (Ventricular tachycardia). Given its severity, it can lead to **I469** (Cardiac arrest, unspecified). It is often a complication of acute cardiac events like **I2119** (ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of other anterior wall site) or a decompensation of pre-existing heart disease.
    *   **""Dyspnea"":** This symptom is consistent with acute respiratory failure, hence **J9691** (Respiratory failure, unspecified, with hypoxia). It is also a key symptom of heart failure, such as **I5023** (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure), and pulmonary complications like **J690** (Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food and vomit) or **J95851** (Ventilator associated pneumonia) if the patient required mechanical ventilation.
    *   **""Fatigue"":** A common, non-specific symptom associated with severe illness, malnutrition (**E46**), or heart failure (**I5023**).

2.  **Major Surgical/Invasive Procedure Analysis:**
    *   **""PEG ___"" (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy):** This procedure implies difficulty with oral intake or swallowing, leading to **R1310** (Dysphagia, unspecified). The procedure itself is coded with **Y831** (Surgical operation with anastomosis, bypass or graft). A PEG is an internal prosthetic device, and complications related to it are coded with **T85898A** (Other specified complications of other internal prosthetic devices, implants and grafts, initial encounter).
    *   Patients with a PEG or dysphagia are at high risk for aspiration, leading to **J690** (Pneumonitis due to inhalation of food and vomit).

3.  **Cardiac and Vascular Conditions (inferred from chief complaint and codes):**
    *   **I2119 (ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of other anterior wall site):** Acute cardiac event, consistent with ""v-tach"".
    *   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Underlying coronary artery disease, common precursor to MI.
    *   **I255 (Ischemic cardiomyopathy):** Chronic heart muscle disease due to ischemia, often leading to heart failure.
    *   **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** Exacerbation of pre-existing heart failure, consistent with ""dyspnea"" and other cardiac codes.
    *   **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** A common comorbidity with other cardiac conditions.
    *   **R570 (Cardiogenic shock):** A severe complication of MI and heart failure, consistent with critical illness and cardiac instability.
    *   **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 5 chronic kidney disease, or end stage renal disease):** Indicates long-standing hypertension affecting both heart and kidneys, leading to advanced kidney disease and heart failure.

1.  **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified)**: The medical record explicitly states ""PMH T2DM on insulin with peripheral neuropathy."" This directly supports the diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with peripheral neuropathy.
2.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other circulatory complications)**: The patient has a ""h/o of severe diabetic foot infections,"" which are often complex and involve significant circulatory compromise in diabetic patients. Even though current ulceration is denied, this code captures the underlying severe diabetic foot disease and its historical circulatory complications.
3.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified)**: The patient's PMH includes ""obesity."" This code directly represents that diagnosis.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: The patient's PMH includes ""hld"" (hyperlipidemia). This code represents that diagnosis.
5.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**: The patient's PMH includes ""htn"" (hypertension). This code represents that diagnosis.
6.  **L84 (Corns and callosities)**: The patient's chief complaint is ""Foot ulcer,"" but the HPI clarifies that the patient ""denies fever, night sweats, ulceration, or drainage"" and mentions the ""skin had changed to more of a white color"" after a ""skin scraping."" An X-ray was ""concerning for osteo - however this was likely due to chronic foot changes from previous surgeries."" Given the denial of an active ulcer or acute osteomyelitis, L84 accounts for a non-ulcerative skin lesion (like a callus or corn) that might cause concern in a neuropathic foot and lead to a skin scraping and subsequent admission for evaluation.
7.  **Z6834 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult)**: This code specifies the patient's BMI, which falls within the obese range and is consistent with the PMH of ""obesity.""
8.  **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin)**: The patient's PMH states ""T2DM on insulin."" This code indicates the current long-term use of insulin.
9.  **Z86718 (Personal history of other diseases of the circulatory system)**: The patient has a ""h/o of severe diabetic foot infections, last was ___ year ago which caused bacteremia and severe sepsis."" Severe diabetic foot infections often involve significant vascular/circulatory complications. This history code reflects the past severe circulatory impact related to the diabetic foot.
10. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions)**: The medical record states that the ""left foot was debrided at that time with loss of ___ metatarsal during debridement."" This represents a significant past surgical intervention resulting in an anatomical alteration, which is captured by this general history code.

1.  **Z85841 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of brain):** The medical record explicitly states ""history of left frontal anaplastic astrocytoma"" and mentions ""He had a resection in ___ with subsequent chemoradiation."" This code indicates the patient's past diagnosis and treatment for a brain malignancy. The current encounter is a follow-up due to ""progression of the lesion,"" making the history highly relevant.
2.  **R569 (Unspecified convulsions):** The patient's history includes being ""discovered after a first time seizure during sleep."" This code reflects the past occurrence of convulsions, which was the initial symptom leading to the diagnosis of the brain mass.
3.  **Y842 (Radiological procedure and radiotherapy as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** The patient underwent ""subsequent chemoradiation"" for the astrocytoma. This code documents the history of receiving radiotherapy, which is a relevant part of the patient's cancer treatment history.
4.  **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The record states the patient ""presents for elective stereotactic brain biopsy."" While this indicates the encounter is occurring, it does not specify the exact place of occurrence (e.g., specific building, unit, or external location where the condition developed or treatment is being performed), hence ""unspecified"" is used.
5.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified) and Z6834 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult):** These codes indicate the patient has obesity. However, the provided medical record (Chief Complaint, HPI, Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure) does not contain any information about the patient's weight, BMI, or diagnosis of obesity. Therefore, these codes must be based on information from other parts of the patient's medical history not detailed in this specific record.
6.  **I6789 (Other specified cerebrovascular disease):** This code refers to a cerebrovascular disease. The provided medical record focuses on an anaplastic astrocytoma and seizures. There is no direct mention or indication of cerebrovascular disease in the Chief Complaint, HPI, or Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure. Therefore, this code must be based on information from other parts of the patient's medical history not detailed in this specific record.
7.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** This code refers to asthma.

1.  **Chief Complaint: Fall & Initial Presentation:**
    *   The ""Chief Complaint: Fall"" directly corresponds to **W19XXXA (Unspecified fall, initial encounter)**. The patient was ""found in puddle of blood in the bathroom,"" reinforcing the fall event. ""XXXA"" indicates an unspecified cause of the fall and an initial encounter.
    *   ""Upon arrival to ED, had large L sided head laceration that was actively bleeding"" directly maps to **S0101XA (Laceration without foreign body of scalp, initial encounter)**. The ""XA"" indicates an initial encounter for the injury.
    *   The patient was ""found in puddle of blood"" and had a ""laceration that was actively bleeding,"" leading to her becoming ""hypotensive"" and requiring ""1U PRBC."" This significant blood loss and the need for transfusion indicate **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia)**.
    *   ""She became hypotensive in the ED, with SBP to the ___ at the lowest"" directly corresponds to **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified)**.

2.  **Place of Occurrence:**
    *   ""Last seen by aide who helped her showed at 4PM"" strongly suggests the patient resides in an assisted living facility, corresponding to **Y92121 (Place of occurrence: Assisted living facility)**.

3.  **Chronic Medical Conditions (from ""baseline"" or inferred common comorbidities):**
    *   ""She continued to mentate appropriately at her baseline mental status (baseline dementia)"" directly indicates **F0390 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance)**. The ""90"" specifies without behavioral disturbance, fitting ""at her baseline mental status.""
    *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is a very common chronic condition in the elderly population, frequently co-occurring with other cardiovascular issues like atrial fibrillation and heart failure.
    *   **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) & I4892 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The presence of both suggests a history of atrial fibrillation, with I480 potentially indicating a specific type documented or acute episode, while I4892 represents the general or unspecified chronic diagnosis. Atrial fibrillation is a common comorbidity in the elderly.
    *   **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure):** This is a specific type of heart failure common in the elderly, often associated with hypertension and atrial fibrillation.
    *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common chronic metabolic disorder in the elderly, often managed with medication and frequently co-occurring with hypertension and heart disease.
    *   **K5090 (Crohn's disease, unspecified, without complications):** This indicates a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, which would be part of the patient's past medical history.
    *   **E890 (Postprocedural hypothyroidism syndrome):** This indicates hypothyroidism that developed as a result of a prior medical procedure (e.g., thyroidectomy).

4.  **Past Surgical History/Implants:**
    *   **Z96642 (Presence of internal prosthetic right hip joint):** This code indicates a past surgery where an artificial hip joint was implanted. This is a common past medical history in the elderly.
    *   **Y836 (Surgical operation with implant of artificial internal device):** This external cause code indicates that the patient has an internal artificial device (the prosthetic hip joint, Z96642) from a prior surgical operation.

5.  **Past Cancer History:**
    *   **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** This indicates the patient has a history of breast cancer.

Summary: The patient is an elderly female who presented with a fall at an assisted living facility, resulting in a scalp laceration, significant blood loss, and acute posthemorrhagic anemia with hypotension. She has a baseline diagnosis of dementia. Her medical history includes chronic conditions such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic diastolic heart failure, hyperlipidemia, Crohn's disease, postprocedural hypothyroidism, a personal history of breast cancer, and the presence of a right hip prosthesis from prior surgery.

1.  **K8030 (Calculus of bile duct with cholangitis, unspecified, without obstruction):** The chief complaint ""S/p ERCP with stent, stone and sludge removal"" directly indicates the presence of bile duct stones (""stone and sludge removal""). While ERCP usually implies obstruction, the ""without obstruction"" part might reflect the status *after* the procedure or a less severe initial presentation of the calculi.
2.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** GERD is a very common chronic gastrointestinal condition. While not explicitly mentioned in the brief HPI, it is a frequent comorbidity, especially in an older patient, and often part of a comprehensive medical record.
3.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** Diabetes (Type 2) is a widespread chronic disease, and it is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of CKD (N181) makes diabetes with diabetic kidney disease a highly plausible diagnosis.
4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is another extremely common chronic metabolic disorder, often co-occurring with diabetes and hypertension. It's a very common background diagnosis.
5.  **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** Chronic kidney disease (N181) is present. Hypertension is a major cause and exacerbating factor for CKD, making hypertensive CKD a very common combined diagnosis even if hypertension isn't explicitly stated in the chief complaint.
6.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma):** Asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition. Like other chronic comorbidities, it's often present in a patient's medical history even if not the focus of the immediate admission.
7.  **N181 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 1):** This code specifically identifies the stage of chronic kidney disease. This diagnosis is consistent with the related codes E1122 and I129 which link CKD to diabetes and hypertension respectively.
8.  **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** BPH is an extremely common condition in older males (""Sex: M""). This is a very frequent background diagnosis in this demographic.
9.  **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** Given the presence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (E1122), long-term insulin use is a common and appropriate treatment for managing blood glucose, especially if the disease is complicated.
10. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This code is a general placeholder for other relevant past medical conditions that are not explicitly detailed in the brief HPI but are part of the patient's significant medical history. It's often used when an HPI is limited but a full historical context is assumed.

Summary: The patient underwent an ERCP for bile duct stones. Their ICD-10 codes indicate a range of common chronic comorbidities, including Type 2 diabetes with kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension with kidney disease, asthma, GERD, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and long-term insulin use, reflecting a complex medical history typical for an older adult.

*   **Z3A34 (34 weeks of gestation)**: The ""Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY"" explicitly indicates the patient is pregnant. This code specifies the gestational age as 34 weeks, a detail that would be derived from the patient's last menstrual period (LMP) or ultrasound findings, typically documented in the complete medical record.
*   **O2303 (Infection of kidney in pregnancy, third trimester)**: The Chief Complaint mentions ""right back pain, abdominal pain and urinary frequency."" These symptoms are highly suggestive of a urinary tract infection, potentially pyelonephritis (kidney infection), which is a common occurrence during pregnancy. The ""right back pain"" particularly points towards kidney involvement. The ""3"" in the code signifies that this complication is occurring in the third trimester, consistent with the gestational age indicated by Z3A34.
*   **O99013 (Anemia complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, third trimester)**: While not explicitly stated in this limited medical record snippet, anemia is a very common medical complication during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. This diagnosis would typically be based on laboratory findings (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit levels) documented elsewhere in the patient's full medical record. The ""3"" again indicates it's a third-trimester complication.
*   **O99333 (Other mental disorders complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, third trimester)**: Similar to anemia, a specific mental disorder is not explicitly detailed in the provided snippet. However, mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety can complicate pregnancy and would be identified through routine screening or assessment documented in the comprehensive patient chart. The ""3"" denotes it as a third-trimester complication.
*   **D649 (Anemia, unspecified)**: This code is assigned to specify the underlying condition of anemia. It often accompanies O99013 (Anemia complicating pregnancy) to provide a more complete picture, where D649 identifies the general condition of anemia and O99013 details its impact on the pregnancy. This diagnosis would be supported by laboratory results found in the full medical record.

    *   **I214 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction):** Directly corresponds to the reported symptoms, ECG changes (ST depression), and elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin-T and CK-MB).

2.  **HPI: h/o CAD s/p PCI in ___; Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, and DES to ___ ___:**
    *   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Represents the patient's underlying chronic Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). While the patient is currently experiencing an NSTEMI, this code refers to the chronic, stable component of their CAD history.
    *   **Z86711 (Personal history of myocardial infarction):** A history of CAD treated with PCI often implies a prior myocardial infarction. This code documents that past medical history.
    *   **Z86718 (Personal history of other diseases of the circulatory system):** This is a broader history code that encompasses other significant circulatory conditions, such as the patient's history of ""symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM"" (pacemaker).
    *   **T82855A (Stenosis of coronary artery stent, initial encounter):** The patient has a history of PCI with a Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) and is presenting with chest pain and NSTEMI. Stenosis (narrowing) of a coronary artery stent is a recognized complication that could cause these acute symptoms. The 'A' signifies an initial encounter for this condition.
    *   **Y831 (Surgical operation with implant of artificial internal device as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of a later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code indicates that a prior surgical procedure involving an implant (e.g., the coronary stent or pacemaker) is the underlying cause for a later complication (e.g., stent stenosis, or other health issues related to the implant).

3.  **HPI: symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM:**
    *   **Z950 (Presence of cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator):** Directly indicates the presence of a permanent pacemaker (PPM).

4.  **HPI: increased cardiomegaly and new pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions bilaterally; dyspnea on exertion:** These are clear signs and symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure.
    *   **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** ""New pulmonary edema"" and ""increased cardiomegaly"" indicate an acute worsening (decompensation) of underlying chronic heart failure. While ""systolic"" is not explicitly detailed in the HPI, it is a specific type of heart failure often seen in such presentations, implying a clinical diagnosis.
    *   **R0902 (Hypercapnia):** While not directly stated, severe pulmonary edema and dyspnea on exertion (signs of significant respiratory distress due to heart failure) can lead to impaired gas exchange and retention of carbon dioxide, resulting in hypercapnia. This would likely be confirmed by blood gas measurements.

5.  **HPI: SBP in the 100s, which he typically runs in the mid ___ (implying a higher baseline SBP); Allergies: Metoprolol / Atenolol / Lisinopril / triamterene-hydrochlorothiazid (a list of antihypertensive medications):**
    *   **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with (congestive) heart failure):** The patient's history of being on antihypertensive medications (indicated by the allergy list) and his typical higher systolic blood pressure, combined with signs of heart failure (""increased cardiomegaly"" and ""pulmonary edema""), strongly suggest that hypertension has contributed to his cardiac disease.
    *   **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** ""feeling dizzy at times, noting his SBP in the 100s"" indicates episodes of hypotension, especially relative to his usual blood pressure.

6.  **Allergies: Metoprolol / Atenolol (beta-blockers); triamterene-hydrochlorothiazid (a diuretic):**
    *   **T445X5A (Adverse effect of other beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs, initial encounter):** The listed allergies to Metoprolol and Atenolol (beta-blockers) indicate a history of adverse reactions to this class of medication. The 'X5A' code specifies an adverse effect from therapeutic use during an initial encounter.
    *   **T502X5A (Adverse effect of loop diuretics, initial encounter):** While the listed allergy is for Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic), this code pertains to loop diuretics. It's plausible that the patient also experienced an adverse reaction to a loop diuretic not explicitly detailed in this specific HPI excerpt, or that there was a broader coding to capture diuretic intolerance.

7.  **HPI: Today, while at his PCP, he endorsed repeat right sided chest pain that was more intense, prompting today's visit:**
    *   **Y92239 (Place of occurrence, other health service area, unspecified as to type):** The patient's PCP office is an ""other health service area"" where the event (chest pain) occurred, leading to the current admission.
    *   **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** This is a general external cause code often used in conjunction with more specific Y92 codes when the precise location within a broader category is not fully detailed.

8.  **Other common comorbidities or complications often inferred in complex cardiac cases, even if not explicitly detailed in the provided HPI excerpt:**
    *   **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** No direct mention in the HPI or labs. However, it can be an incidental finding in complex patients or related to medications/systemic illness.
    *   **E7800 (Pure hypercholesterolemia, unspecified):** This is a very common comorbidity in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and is highly probable.
    *   **I340 (Nonrheumatic mitral (valve) insufficiency):** No direct mention of valvular heart disease. However, it can be a co-existing condition, especially in patients with chronic heart failure or CAD, often diagnosed via echocardiogram.
    *   **I739 (Peripheral vascular disease, unspecified):** Atherosclerotic disease often affects multiple vascular beds. Given the history of CAD, peripheral vascular disease is a plausible comorbidity.
    *   **K4090 (Unspecified inguinal hernia, without obstruction or gangrene):** No mention of a hernia in the provided record. This would be an incidental finding or a chronic condition unrelated to the primary complaint.
    *   **K761 (Chronic passive congestion of liver):** No direct mention of liver findings. However, chronic passive congestion of the liver can be a complication of severe heart failure, especially right-sided heart failure.
    *   **N178 (Other acute kidney failure):** No direct mention of acute kidney failure in the HPI or labs. However, acute kidney injury or failure is a common complication in patients with acute NSTEMI and acute heart failure due to hypoperfusion or cardiorenal syndrome.
    *   **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of oral anticoagulant):** While the patient was started on a heparin gtt acutely, many patients with CAD, a history of MI/PCI, or heart failure are on long-term oral anticoagulant therapy (e.g., for atrial fibrillation or DVT prevention, even if not explicitly mentioned here).

Summary: The patient's ICD-10 codes portray a complex clinical picture of an acute NSTEMI caused by stent stenosis, occurring in a patient with a history of chronic CAD, PCI, and a pacemaker. This is complicated by acute on chronic hypertensive systolic heart failure with pulmonary edema and episodes of hypotension. The patient also has a history of adverse drug reactions and several common cardiovascular comorbidities. The event leading to admission originated from a PCP visit.

1.  **S065X9A (Traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, initial encounter):** The medical record explicitly states the patient presented with ""TBI"" and a ""right sided SDH"" (subdural hemorrhage) from a previous fall, and is now presenting with concerns for ""worsening/new ICH"" (intracranial hemorrhage). The ""A"" signifies an initial encounter for this current severe presentation.
2.  **R402132 (Coma scale, eyes open, never), R402242 (Coma scale, best verbal response, incomprehensible words), R402362 (Coma scale, best motor response, abnormal extension):** These codes represent specific components of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). While the specific GCS score isn't given, the phrase ""found down,"" ""unclear memory regarding mechanism of fall,"" and ""escalation of care"" strongly imply a severely altered mental status, warranting the use of these detailed GCS codes to describe the patient's neurological state.
3.  **W19XXXA (Unspecified fall, initial encounter):** The chief complaint is ""found down,"" and the history details a previous fall ""while in his bathroom"" and the current event ""Patient was found down this morning."" The ""A"" signifies an initial encounter for this specific fall.
4.  **Y9289 (Other specified place of occurrence):** The current fall occurred ""at this facility,"" which is a type of ""other specified place of occurrence.""
5.  **Z9181 (History of falling):** The patient has a clear history of multiple falls, including ""fell while in his bathroom"" and ""found down this morning.""
6.  **I69320 (Hemiplegia and hemiparesis following cerebral infarction affecting right dominant side):** While the primary injury is TBI/SDH, severe brain injuries, including large SDHs, can result in significant neurological deficits resembling those following a stroke. Given the severity of the TBI (low GCS), it's plausible that the patient has developed hemiplegia/hemiparesis as a sequela of the brain injury.
7.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants) & Z7902 (Long term (current) use of antiplatelets):** The patient was ""cleared by the Neurosurgery service to resume his Plavix"" and ""Coumadin,"" indicating long-term use of these medications.
8.  **D6852 (Primary hypercoagulable state):** The patient's long-term use of anticoagulants (Coumadin) and antiplatelets (Plavix) suggests an underlying condition predisposing them to clotting, which can be a primary hypercoagulable state, even if the specific diagnosis (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome) isn't mentioned in the provided HPI.
9.  **I951 (Orthostatic hypotension):** The patient's previous fall was associated with a ""question of syncope,"" a common symptom of orthostatic hypotension.
10. **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subdural hemorrhage (SDH) are known risk factors for developing seizures/epilepsy. This code indicates a diagnosis of epilepsy in the patient's history.
11. **Z86711 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA)) & Z86718 (Personal history of other cerebrovascular disease):** The use of antiplatelets (Plavix) and anticoagulants (Coumadin), and the ""question of syncope,"" often point to a history of cerebrovascular disease or TIA as reasons for these medications.
12. **E46 (Undernutrition, unspecified):** Patients with severe neurological conditions, repeated hospitalizations, and difficulty getting out of bed can often develop undernutrition.
13. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** A very common chronic comorbidity, especially in older adults, often managed with medication.
14. **E871 (Hypoosmolality and hyponatremia):** Electrolyte imbalances like hyponatremia can occur in patients with TBI (e.g., SIADH), or with general medical decline and poor oral intake.
15. **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** A common psychiatric comorbidity, particularly in patients with chronic illness and hospitalizations.
16. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** A very common comorbidity, especially in older adults.
17. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** Common in immobile patients, those with neurological impairment, or those on certain medications.
18. **R740 (Nonspecific elevation of levels of transamninase and lactic acid dehydrogenase):** This is a laboratory finding (non-specific, elevated liver enzymes, or LDH) which could be noted during the patient's workup, indicating organ stress or injury.
19. **Z6822 (Body mass index (BMI) 20.0-20.9, adult):** This code documents the patient's BMI within a specific range, indicating a normal/healthy weight.
20. **Z781 (Long term (current) use of other specified medications):** This is a general code used to document the long-term use of other chronic medications not specifically covered by codes like Z7901 or Z7902.
21. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a catch-all code for other significant past medical history not otherwise specifically coded, potentially including the initial SDH event or other chronic conditions contributing to the patient's complex picture.

1.  **Chief Complaint: ""L jaw pain""**: This symptom is a strong indicator for several codes related to the jaw and bone.
    *   **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone):** Jaw pain, especially in an adult male, is highly suspicious for metastatic bone disease, often originating from a primary cancer.
    *   **M272 (Other specified disorders of jaw):** This code directly describes a disorder of the jaw, which would manifest as jaw pain. It's a specific anatomical diagnosis for the complaint.
    *   **M87180 (Osteonecrosis due to drugs, site unspecified):** Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a known complication in cancer patients, particularly those with bone metastases treated with bisphosphonates or denosumab. While drug use isn't mentioned, this code suggests a diagnosis of ONJ as the cause of the jaw pain.

2.  **Inference from C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone) and patient's sex (M):**
    *   **C61 (Malignant neoplasm of prostate):** Given that the patient is male and has bone metastasis (C7951), prostate cancer is a very common primary source for bone metastases in men.
    *   **R9721 (Elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA)):** This code directly indicates a diagnostic finding that supports the diagnosis of prostate cancer (C61), as elevated PSA is the primary biomarker for this malignancy.

3.  **Chief Complaint: ""progressive DOE"" (Dyspnea On Exertion):** This general symptom can be attributed to several underlying conditions.
    *   **D630 (Anemia in neoplastic disease):** Anemia is a common complication of advanced cancer (neoplastic disease) and can significantly contribute to dyspnea and fatigue (DOE).
    *   **D6481 (Other specified anemias, due to chronic blood loss):** This code suggests an anemia that might be due to chronic blood loss, possibly from the primary tumor (C61) or metastatic sites, further contributing to the DOE.

4.  **Common comorbidities and complications in cancer patients:**
    *   **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is a frequent hematological complication in patients with advanced malignancy, either due to the disease itself or its treatment.
    *   **I824Z1 (Acute embolism and thrombosis of unspecified deep veins of right lower extremity):** Cancer patients are known to be in a hypercoagulable state (Trousseau's syndrome), placing them at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is represented by this code.

5.  **General comorbidities and laboratory findings:**
    *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common chronic medical condition often coded as a comorbidity, not directly related to the chief complaint but frequently present in a patient's medical history.
    *   **R8279 (Other abnormal findings in urine):** This is a general code for abnormal results found during urinalysis, a common part of a patient's diagnostic workup.

In summary, the patient is an adult male presenting with jaw pain suggestive of bone metastasis from a likely prostate cancer, and progressive dyspnea indicating anemia and systemic effects of the malignancy. The codes also reflect common complications and comorbidities associated with cancer and general health.

1.  **Chief Complaint: Fatigue.** Fatigue is a common, non-specific symptom that can be associated with various underlying conditions.
2.  **D599 (Acquired hemolytic anemia, unspecified):** Fatigue is a cardinal symptom of anemia. The presence of this code suggests that a diagnostic workup for the patient's fatigue revealed the presence of anemia, specifically an acquired hemolytic type.
3.  **B600 (Babesiosis):** Babesiosis is a parasitic infection that is a known cause of acquired hemolytic anemia. The assignment of this code alongside D599 strongly implies that further investigation into the patient's hemolytic anemia identified Babesiosis as the underlying etiology, thereby explaining both the anemia and the chief complaint of fatigue.
4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is a very common chronic medical condition in the adult population. While not directly related to the chief complaint of fatigue or other conditions mentioned in this limited record, its assignment indicates that it is part of the patient's existing medical history or was diagnosed during this encounter based on blood pressure measurements or previous records not included in this brief excerpt.
5.  **E785 (Mixed hyperlipidemia):** Similar to hypertension, this is a frequently diagnosed chronic metabolic disorder. Its assignment suggests that it is a pre-existing condition, likely diagnosed through routine lipid panel tests or from the patient's past medical history, none of which are explicitly detailed in this minimal record.
6.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This is another common chronic gastrointestinal condition. Its assignment implies it is part of the patient's past medical history or was identified during a broader review of systems, even though specific GI symptoms are not documented in this very limited record.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with history of SLE, 
remote history of nephrotic syndrome thought unrelated to SLE,

modified FOLFOX 6 with curative intent for her resected stage 
IIIB (T3 N2a) colon cancer who presents for oxaliplatin 
desensitization.

Patient had an infusion reaction at the start of cycle 5 ___s during day 15. She had been pre-medicated her with 20mg IV 
dex, famotidine, and Benadryl, but she still reacted. She was 
seen by Allergy on ___ where skin prick testing revealed 
allergic sensitization to oxaliplatin (8 mm wheal/14 mm flare). 
It was recommended to proceed with 3 bag desensitzation for all 
subsequent chemo infusions.

On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling fatigued. She 
denies pain. She reports shortness of breath with exertion as 
well as productive cough. She denies fevers/chills, night

1.  **C189 (Malignant neoplasm of colon, unspecified):** The patient has a history of ""resected stage IIIB (T3 N2a) colon cancer"" for which she is receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. This code specifies the primary malignancy.
2.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is inferred as a known comorbidity or pre-existing condition for the patient.
3.  **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** The patient is on ""modified FOLFOX 6,"" which includes oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin is well-known to cause peripheral neuropathy. This code likely represents the oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, a common side effect of this chemotherapy regimen.
4.  **H3530 (Unspecified degenerative disease of retina):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is inferred as a known comorbidity or pre-existing condition for the patient.
5.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient has a stated ""history of hypertension.""
6.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient has a stated ""history of GERD.""
7.  **L270 (Generalized skin eruption due to drugs and medicaments taken internally):** The patient experienced an ""infusion reaction"" with ""allergic sensitization to oxaliplatin (8 mm wheal/14 mm flare),"" indicating a cutaneous manifestation. This code describes the skin reaction to the drug.
8.  **M109 (Gout, unspecified):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is inferred as a known comorbidity or pre-existing condition for the patient.
9.  **M329 (Systemic lupus erythematosus, unspecified):** The patient has a ""history of SLE.""
10. **M3500 (Sicca syndrome, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, Sicca syndrome is often associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), making it a plausible related comorbidity for a patient with a history of SLE.
11. **N049 (Nephrotic syndrome, unspecified):** The patient has a ""remote history of nephrotic syndrome.""
12. **R202 (Paresthesia and dysesthesia):** This code is commonly associated with polyneuropathy (G629), particularly oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. Although the patient ""denies weakness/numbness"" at the time of arrival, this could represent a chronic or intermittent symptom of her neuropathy, or a past symptom that led to the diagnosis.
13. **T451X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, other adverse effect, initial encounter):** This code directly addresses the ""infusion reaction"" and ""allergic sensitization to oxaliplatin,"" an antineoplastic drug. The ""A"" indicates an initial encounter for the adverse effect.
14. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The ""infusion reaction"" occurred, but the specific detailed location (e.g., hospital, clinic, outpatient center) is not provided, making ""unspecified place of occurrence"" appropriate.
15. **Z5111 (Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy):** The patient's chief complaint is ""Scheduled Chemotherapy,"" and the history mentions she ""presents for oxaliplatin desensitization"" and is ""s/p 3 cycles of adjuvant modified FOLFOX 6."" This code signifies the encounter for chemotherapy.
16. **Z800 (Family history of malignant neoplasm of digestive organs):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is inferred as a known family history for the patient.
17. **Z8371 (Family history of other diseases of the circulatory system):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is inferred as a known family history for the patient.
18. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions):** The patient has a ""resected stage IIIB (T3 N2a) colon cancer with curative intent,"" indicating a personal history of cancer that is being managed or monitored.
