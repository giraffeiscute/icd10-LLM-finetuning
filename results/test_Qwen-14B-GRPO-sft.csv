逐步推理：
1.  **Agitation and psychosis (Chief Complaint):** 患者因躁動和精神病入院，且病史中提到「recurrent admission to the hospital for psychosis」，這表明精神病是主要的診斷。因此，F20.9 (Schizophrenia, unspecified) 是一個合理的選擇，儘管病史中提到「bipolar vs. schizoaffective disorder」，但當前症狀更符合精神病的表現。
2.  **History of bipolar vs. schizoaffective disorder:** 這是一個重要的既往病史，即使當前症狀更符合精神病，也應記錄。F31.9 (Bipolar affective disorder, current episode unspecified) 可以用來表示雙極障礙的既往史。
3.  **CAD s/p RCA stent (___):** 患者有冠狀動脈疾病史，並接受了右冠狀動脈支架植入術。I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 用於描述冠狀動脈疾病，而Z95.5 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft) 用於表示支架的存在。
4.  **DM type II:** 患者有第二型糖尿病。E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 用於表示糖尿病。
5.  **Substance acute:** 患者有急性物質使用史。F19.90 (Other substance abuse, uncomplicated) 用於表示其他物質濫用。
6.  **Off her medications:** 患者目前未服藥，這是一個重要的臨床資訊，可能影響其症狀。Z91.11 (Noncompliance with medical treatment) 用於表示未遵從醫囑。
7.  **Brother died 2 days ago:** 患者兄弟去世是近期的壓力事件，可能與其精神症狀有關。Z63.4 (Bereavement) 用於表示喪親。
8.  **Allergies: Haldol / Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics):** 患者對Haldol、青黴素和磺胺類抗生素過敏。Z88.0 (Allergy to antipsychotic drugs) 用於表示對抗精神病藥物的過敏，Z88.3 (Allergy to penicillin) 用於表示對青黴素的過敏，Z88.4 (Allergy to sulfonamide drugs) 用於表示對磺胺類藥物的過敏。
9.  **Homeless shelter:** 患者居住在無家可歸者收容所，這是一個重要的社會人口學資訊。Z59.0 (Homelessness) 用於表示無家可歸。
10. **Labile glucose management (FICU admission):** 患者曾因血糖不穩定入院，這表明糖尿病控制不佳。Z79.4 (Long term (current) use of insulin) 用於表示長期使用胰島素，Z89.2 (Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus) 用於表示糖尿病控制不佳。
11. **Naked screaming and yelling at people:** 患者在街上赤裸裸地尖叫並對人喊叫，這是一種行為異常。R45.810 (Other specified abnormal behavior) 用於表示其他指定的異常行為。
12. **Did not want to talk, but denied chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain:** 患者不願談話，但否認胸痛、呼吸困難或腹痛。R45.810 (Other specified abnormal behavior) 也可以用於表示不願談話的行為異常。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Oxaliplatin desensitization** - 這是一個就診原因，不是診斷，通常不編碼。
2.  **H/o metastatic colorectal cancer on CapeOx (___)** - 這表明患者有轉移性結直腸癌，且正在接受化療。轉移性結直腸癌的 ICD-10 編碼是 C18.9 (未指明的結腸癌) 和 C19.9 (未指明的直腸癌)。由於是轉移性，需要添加 C79.89 (其他特指部位的轉移性惡性腫瘤)。此外，患者正在接受化療，這是一個重要的治療狀態，應編碼 Z51.11 (化療)。
3.  **HTN (Hypertension)** - 高血壓的 ICD-10 編碼是 I10 (原發性高血壓)。
4.  **Depression** - 抑鬱症的 ICD-10 編碼是 F33.9 (未指明的重度抑鬱症)。
5.  **Allergies: Penicillins / Tylenol Cold-Flu Severe Night / lisinopril / oxaliplatin** - 這些是過敏史。Penicillins (青黴素) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.0 (青黴素過敏史)。Tylenol Cold-Flu Severe Night (泰諾感冒藥) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.2 (非青黴素抗生素過敏史)。Lisinopril (利辛普利) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.3 (ACE 抑制劑過敏史)。Oxaliplatin (奧沙利鉑) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.6 (化學藥物過敏史)。
6.  **On ___ C2D1 FOLFOX, the patient developed oxaliplatin during infusion. At that time, he experienced chills and rigors. He then developed pain in his back and chest, as well as itching. He was noted to be flushed and was treated with 25 mg of Benadryl, 50 mg of hydrocortisone, 20 mg of Pepcid, and 10 mg of Decadron. His symptoms then resolved over the course of 30 minutes. Blood cultures at that time were negative.** - 這描述了患者對奧沙利鉑的過敏反應。過敏反應的 ICD-10 編碼是 T36-T50 (藥物、醫學製劑和生物製劑的中毒和不良反應)。由於是對化學藥物的過敏反應，且是首次發生，應編碼 T36.0X5A (化學藥物引起的不良反應，首次就診)。此外，過敏反應的症狀如發冷、寒戰、背痛、胸痛、癢、潮紅等，雖然描述了，但通常不單獨編碼，除非是主要診斷或需要特殊處理。
7.  **Allergy recommend all future oxaliplatin infusions be administered using a 12-step/3 bag desensitization inpatient protocol.** - 這是一個治療建議，不是診斷，通常不編碼。
8.  **Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports that he is feeling well and ready to get started. He is currently asymptomatic. He denies any fevers, chills, dyspnea, or other complaints.** - 這表明患者目前無症狀，因此不需要編碼當前症狀。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: wound dehiscence** (主要主訴：傷口裂開)：患者因傷口裂開入院，這是本次就診的主要原因。對應 ICD-10 編碼 **Z98.818 (Other specified surgical wound dehiscence)**。
2.  **History of Present Illness: cervical spondylosis and stenosis** (病史：頸椎退化性關節炎和脊髓腔狹窄)：這是患者接受手術的原發疾病。對應 ICD-10 編碼 **M47.16 (Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy)**。
3.  **History of Present Illness: status post posterior laminectomy C3 C4 C5 C6-C7 and laminectomy at T1, fusion C3-T1** (病史：接受後方椎板切除術 C3 C4 C5 C6-C7 和 T1 椎板切除術，C3-T1 融合)：這是患者既往的外科手術史。對應 ICD-10 編碼 **Z90.01 (Presence of other orthopedic implant, prosthesis, and graft)**。
4.  **History of Present Illness: wound dehiscence** (病史：傷口裂開)：再次強調本次就診的主要原因，已由 Z98.818 覆蓋。
5.  **History of Present Illness: no worsening neck pain, fever, weakness, numbness or tingling, in fact, states that his hand numbness has been improving post-op. Denies bowel or bladder dysfunction.** (病史：無頸部疼痛、發燒、無力、麻木或刺痛，事實上，他表示他的手部麻木症狀在手術後有所改善。否認大小便功能障礙。)：這些是患者目前的症狀，但並未達到需要單獨編碼的嚴重程度或需要進一步評估的臨床意義。因此，不需額外編碼。
6.  **Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions** (過敏史：無已知過敏史 / 藥物不良反應)：無需編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma with bony mets (胃腺癌IV期伴骨轉移):** 這是患者的主要診斷，應編碼為 C16.9 (胃癌，未指明部位) 和 C79.51 (骨轉移，未指明原發部位)。
2.  **Nausea with vomiting (噁心嘔吐):** 這是本次就診的主要症狀，應編碼為 R11.0 (噁心) 和 R11.10 (嘔吐，未指明原因)。
3.  **Inability to keep down PO (無法口服):** 這是一個重要的症狀，與嘔吐相關，應編碼為 R11.11 (嘔吐伴吞咽困難)。
4.  **Distal esophageal stricture (遠端食道狹窄):** 這是導致噁心嘔吐和吞咽困難的直接原因，應編碼為 K22.2 (食道狹窄)。
5.  **GE mass (胃食道腫瘤):** 這是導致食道狹窄和症狀的根本原因，應編碼為 C16.9 (胃癌，未指明部位)。
6.  **Recent admit for nausea/vomiting felt ___ discomfort from GE mass (近期因噁心嘔吐就醫，感到胃食道腫瘤不適):** 這表明症狀與腫瘤直接相關，應編碼為 R29.6 (腫瘤引起的症狀和體徵)。
7.  **No BM since last ___ (1 week ago) (自上次排便後已有一週未排便):** 這表明便秘，應編碼為 K59.00 (便秘，未指明)。
8.  **Passing gas from below (從下部放屁):** 這表明腸道功能存在，與便秘相關，但本身不是一個獨立的診斷。
9.  **PMH of stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma with bony mets (病史中提及的胃腺癌IV期伴骨轉移):** 這已經在 C16.9 和 C79.51 中涵蓋。
10. **s/p 4 cycles FOLFOX most recently on Cycle 10 Taxol/Ramucirumab, Cycle 10 of Taxol given, Ramucirumab held (已接受4個週期FOLFOX，最近在第10週期Taxol/Ramucirumab，第10週期Taxol已給藥，Ramucirumab停用):** 這表明患者正在接受化療，但沒有提及具體的不良反應或併發症，因此不需要編碼。
11. **EGD ___ with dilation of distal esophageal stricture (胃鏡檢查並擴張遠端食道狹窄):** 這是一個過去的治療程序，不是當前的診斷。
12. **mass treated with 5 sessions of RT (腫瘤接受5次放療):** 這是一個過去的治療程序，不是當前的診斷。
13. **Esophageal stent not placed during recent admit as it was felt that radiation would alleviate symptoms (近期就醫時未放置食道支架，因認為放療會緩解症狀):** 這是一個過去的治療決定，不是當前的診斷。
14. **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions (無已知過敏史/不良藥物反應):** 這是一個排除性資訊，不需要編碼。

1.  **Abdominal Pain (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴為腹痛，且病史中多次提到腹痛是主要症狀，且疼痛無法控制，導致入院。因此，R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **Small Cell Lung Cancer (PMH):** 患者有小細胞肺癌病史。由於病史中未提及目前是否處於活動期或是否已治癒，因此使用 Z8580 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of other specified sites) 來表示個人惡性腫瘤病史。
3.  **Pancreatic Cancer (PMH):** 患者有胰臟癌病史。同樣，病史中未提及目前狀態，因此使用 Z8580 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of other specified sites)。
4.  **Palliative Care:** 患者是門診緩和醫療的跟進患者，且因疼痛嚴重而入院。這表明患者處於終末期疾病，因此使用 Z518 (Encounter for other palliative care)。
5.  **Constipation:** 患者曾因便秘就醫，且目前有每日排便，但疼痛整體惡化。這表明便秘是其症狀之一，因此使用 K5900 (Constipation, unspecified)。
6.  **Nausea:** 患者有噁心，且與藥物可能相關。因此使用 R117 (Nausea)。
7.  **Lack of Appetite:** 患者有食慾不振，這也是其症狀之一。因此使用 R631 (Anorexia)。
8.  **Inability to Eat:** 患者因疼痛和噁心無法進食。這是一個症狀，因此使用 R632 (Inability to eat)。
9.  **Pain with Movement:** 患者有活動時疼痛，這是一個症狀。因此使用 R202 (Pain on movement)。
10. **Pain Uncontrolled by Medications:** 患者疼痛無法控制，這是一個症狀。因此使用 R202 (Pain on movement)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Obesity** - 患者的主要主訴是肥胖，且病史中明確提到「class III morbid obesity」，這對應 ICD-10 編碼 E66.03 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories)。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Weight of 291.7 pounds** - 這進一步支持了 E66.03 的診斷。
3.  **History of Present Illness: Previous weight loss attempts have included physician supervised weight management, Weight Watchers, Nutrisystem, over-the-counter herbal supplement Herbalife and hypnosis where she had lost 65-70 pounds. She has not taken prescription weight loss medications.** - 這表明患者曾嘗試多種非手術減重方法，但效果有限，這支持了 E66.03 的診斷。
4.  **History of Present Illness: Her lowest adult weight was 165 pounds at the age of ___ and her highest weight is her current weight of 292 pounds. She stated that she has been struggling with weight since she was in college and cites as factors contributing to her excess weight genetics, large portions, late-night eating, emotional eating, convenience eating, boredom, to many carbohydrates and lack of exercise regimen.** - 這些都是導致肥胖的相關因素，但通常不單獨編碼，除非是特定的共病或需要特別關注的症狀。
5.  **History of Present Illness: She does try to walk for 15 minutes 5 times a week.** - 這表明患者有一定程度的運動習慣，但不足以改變其肥胖狀態。
6.  **History of Present Illness: She denied history of eating disorders - no anorexia, bulimia, diuretic or laxative abuse and she denied binge eating.** - 患者否認有暴食症、厭食症、利尿劑或瀉藥濫用史，因此不編碼這些診斷。
7.  **History of Present Illness: She does have depression/anxiety and is followed by a psychiatrist for past ___ years, has not been hospitalized for mental health issues and she is on psychotropic medications (bupropion, escitalopram).** - 患者有抑鬱和焦慮，且正在服用抗精神藥物，這對應 ICD-10 編碼 F33.9 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified) 和 F41.9 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified)。
8.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: sleeve gastrectomy, liver bx x 2** - 這些是手術和檢查，通常不編碼為診斷，除非是術後併發症或需要跟蹤的診斷。

逐步推理：
1.  **trauma with fall**: 患者因跌倒導致右腳踝無法活動，這是主要的外傷事件。因此，應編碼跌倒 (Y92.010) 作為導致傷害的外部原因。
2.  **loss of motion of his R ankle**: 右腳踝無法活動，這是主要的症狀。由於沒有提到骨折或脫臼，且患者描述為「cramping sensation」，最合理的診斷是右腳踝的肌肉痙攣 (R27.0)。
3.  **CK is 35,000**: 肌酸酐激酶 (CK) 激增至 35,000，這是一個重要的實驗室檢查結果，提示肌肉損傷。由於患者有吸毒史，且CK激增與「cramping sensation」和「prolonged down time」相關，最合理的診斷是急性肌肉損傷 (M62.81)。
4.  **active IV cocaine user**: 患者是活躍的靜脈注射可卡因使用者，這是一個重要的慢性病史。應編碼可卡因使用 (F14.20)。
5.  **cocaine binge**: 患者描述為「cocaine binge」，這表明近期有可卡因的急性使用。應編碼可卡因中毒 (T40.1X5A)。
6.  **some finger parasthesias**: 患者有右手指的異常感覺，這是一個症狀。應編碼右手指的異常感覺 (R20.21)。
7.  **some diffuse parasthesias in the R hand**: 患者有右手中度的異常感覺，這是一個症狀。應編碼右手中度的異常感覺 (R20.22)。
8.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions**: 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼。
9.  **CK is 17**: 肌酸酐 (CK) 激增至 17，這是一個重要的實驗室檢查結果，提示腎功能異常。應編碼急性腎功能衰竭 (N17.9)。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   Y92.010 (跌倒)
*   R27.0 (右腳踝肌肉痙攣)
*   M62.81 (急性肌肉損傷)

逐步推理：
1.  **G4P0212 (Gravida 4, Para 0212):** 這表示患者是第四次懷孕，之前有兩次流產、一次早產和一次活產。這對編碼有幫助，但本身不是一個診斷碼。
2.  **admission for cerclage placement (入院進行縫紉放置):** 這是一個手術程序，對應 ICD-10-PCS 編碼，但問題是要求 ICD-10 診斷碼。
3.  **planned physical-exam indicated cerclage (計劃的體格檢查指示縫紉):** 這進一步強化了縫紉是主要的治療措施。
4.  **anatomic survey and f/u cervical length (解剖學檢查和跟蹤頸部長度):** 這表明患者因頸部短而入院。
5.  **Cervix 1.5 cm in length with funneling (子宮頸長 1.5 公分，伴有漏斗形):** 這是一個明確的診斷，表示子宮頸功能不全，對應 ICD-10 編碼 O44.210 (Cervical incompetence, singleton pregnancy, unspecified trimester)。由於是雙胞胎妊娠，應使用 O44.212 (Cervical incompetence, multiple pregnancy, unspecified trimester)。
6.  **on speculum exam was visually 1 cm dilated (用陰道鏡檢查時可見 1 公分擴張):** 這表明子宮頸擴張，對應 ICD-10 編碼 O44.210 (Cervical incompetence, singleton pregnancy, unspecified trimester) 或 O44.212 (Cervical incompetence, multiple pregnancy, unspecified trimester)。由於是雙胞胎妊娠，應使用 O44.212。
7.  **Last week on her ultrasound the cervix was 2-3 cm in length (上周她的超聲波檢查顯示子宮頸長 2-3 公分):** 這進一步支持了子宮頸功能不全的診斷。
8.  **Reports mild intermittent cramping today; denies contractions. No VB, LOF or change in vaginal discharge. Normal FM x 2. (報告今天有輕度間歇性絞痛；否認宮縮。沒有陰道出血、陰道流液或陰道分泌物的變化。胎心正常 x 2。):** 這些是症狀和檢查結果，但沒有指向新的診斷。
9.  **Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Aspirin (過敏：青黴素 / 磺胺類藥物 / 阿司匹林):** 這些是重要的病史資訊，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin), Z91.012 (Allergy to sulfonamide), Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
10. **Di/di twins (雙胞胎妊娠):** 這是一個重要的妊娠資訊，應編碼為 Z3A.12 (Multiple gestation, unspecified number of fetuses)。

最合理的編碼集合：
*   **O44.212 (Cervical incompetence, multiple pregnancy, unspecified trimester):** 這是主要診斷，因為患者因子宮頸功能不全入院進行縫紉。
*   **Z3A.12 (Multiple gestation, unspecified number of fetuses):** 這表示雙胞胎妊娠。
*   **Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin):** 青黴素過敏。
*   **Z91.012 (Allergy to sulfonamide):** 磺胺類藥物過敏。
*   **Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances):** 阿司匹林過敏。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath (SOB)** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但通常不是一個長期的診斷，而是症狀。在這種情況下，由於患者有嚴重的主動脈瓣和二尖瓣問題，以及左心室功能下降，SOB 是這些心臟疾病的症狀，因此不需要單獨編碼。
2.  **History of aortic insufficiency followed by serial echocardiogram. His most recent echocardiogram showed moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation now with a significantly depressed LV function and dilated left ventricle.** - 這描述了患者的主要心臟疾病。主動脈瓣和二尖瓣的中度至重度反流是主要的瓣膜疾病，左心室功能顯著下降和左心室擴大是心臟功能的表現。
    *   **Moderate to severe aortic insufficiency (Aortic valve insufficiency)** - I35.0
    *   **Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (Mitral valve insufficiency)** - I34.0
    *   **Significantly depressed LV function (Severe left ventricular dysfunction)** - I50.41
    *   **Dilated left ventricle (Left ventricular dilatation)** - I51.9 (Heart disease, unspecified, as a specific code for dilated left ventricle is not available)
3.  **He has spent the last month in ___. Since we last saw him, he has completed his dental work in preparation for cardiac surgery. He was is scheduled to return to his dentist for final clearance this ___.** - 這表明患者有牙科問題，需要進行牙科治療。這是一個重要的共病。
    *   **Dental caries (Tooth decay)** - K02.9 (Unspecified dental caries)
4.  **Over the past few weeks he has had two pillow orthopnea. He was admitted and worked up and ruled out for aortitis and PE. He was diuresed for pleural effusion.** - 這描述了患者在入院前的症狀和診斷。
    *   **Pillow orthopnea (Orthopnea)** - R06.02
    *   **Ruled out for aortitis (Aortitis)** - 由於被排除，通常不編碼，除非有明確的診斷。
    *   **Ruled out for PE (Pulmonary embolism)** - 同樣，由於被排除，通常不編碼。
    *   **Diuresed for pleural effusion (Pleural effusion)** - R91.8 (Other specified abnormal findings of the pleura)。然而，由於患者在入院前已接受利尿劑治療，且未明確提及為急性或需要進一步治療，因此可能不編碼為主要診斷，但可以作為相關的症狀或發現。
5.  **Allergies: amlodipine / nifedipine / shellfish derived** - 這些是患者的過敏史。
    *   **Amlodipine allergy** - Z91.011
    *   **Nifedipine allergy** - Z91.012
    *   **Shellfish derived allergy** - Z91.018

逐步推理：

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath.** 這是一個症狀，但病史中提供了更明確的診斷，因此可能不需要單獨編碼。
2.  **hx non-infarct related CMP (EF ___, ICD for primary prevention):** 這表示患者有非心肌梗死相關的充血性心力衰竭，且射血分數為 ___，並植入了 ICD 用於原發性預防。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I5024 (Congestive heart failure, systolic, with reduced ejection fraction) 和 I252 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。ICD 植入是治療手段，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
3.  **hx metastatic papillary thyroid cancer:** 這表示患者有轉移性乳頭狀甲狀腺癌。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 C73 (Malignant neoplasm of thyroid) 和 Z85.81 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of endocrine system)。
4.  **recent discovery of lung nodules (unclear if primary lung or metastatic endocrine cancer):** 這表示患者最近發現肺部結節，但尚未明確是原發性肺癌還是轉移性內分泌癌。由於尚未確診，這應編碼為 R918 (Unspecified abnormal findings of diagnostic imaging)。
5.  **recent admission ___ for VT ablation which was unsuccessful:** 這表示患者最近因心室性心搏過速 (VT) 就診，但消融術未成功。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I471 (Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia)。
6.  **presents with hypotension and presyncope in setting of increased diuretic doses:** 這表示患者因利尿劑劑量增加而出現低血壓和暈厥前兆。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I959 (Other adverse effects of drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
7.  **On ___, he developed worsening exertional dyspnea and was instructed to increase his lasix dose from 40 mg daily to 80 mg daily (taken as 40mg BID) for 3d. He took the medication for 4d.** 這進一步支持了充血性心力衰竭的診斷，並解釋了低血壓和暈厥前兆的原因。
8.  **Additionally, patient notes that he was previously taking digoxin, and was started on quinidine BID on ___. Patient was unclear on whether or not to continue digoxin, so he continued it through ___ and did not take it on ___.** 這表示患者正在服用地高辛和奎寧，但未明確說明是否為不良反應。由於患者未報告與這些藥物相關的不良事件，因此不編碼為不良反應。

逐步推理：
1.  **T10 and L5 compression fractures (new):** 這些是主要的診斷和手術原因。由於是壓縮性骨折，且未提及病理性骨折，應編碼為 M80.00 (Spontaneous compression fracture of vertebra, unspecified site)。由於是新發的，且未提及病理性，因此選擇 M80.00。
2.  **Plan for surgery (L5 kyphopasty):** 這是一個手術程序，但不是診斷。在 ICD-10 編碼中，手術本身不編碼為診斷，除非是術後併發症或需要跟蹤的狀態。
3.  **History of CAD s/p LCx PCI (BMS x3):** 這是一個重要的既往病史。冠狀動脈疾病 (CAD) 應編碼為 I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。支架置入術是過去的治療，不編碼為當前診斷。
4.  **ICM (EF 35%):** 這表示心臟功能不全。射血分數 35% 指出中度至重度心功能不全。應編碼為 I50.22 (Congestive heart failure, systolic, with reduced ejection fraction)。
5.  **LBBB:** 左束支傳導阻滯是心臟的電生理異常。應編碼為 I44.1 (Left bundle-branch block)。
6.  **pAF on Coumadin:** 慢性心房顫動，正在服用抗凝劑。應編碼為 I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)。
7.  **Moderate MR:** 二尖瓣中度反流。應編碼為 I34.1 (Mitral valve insufficiency)。
8.  **Mild AS:** 主動脈瓣輕度狹窄。應編碼為 I35.0 (Aortic valve stenosis)。
9.  **HTN:** 高血壓。應編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
10. **Hip fracture:** 髋部骨折是既往病史。應編碼為 S72.00XA (Unspecified fracture of unspecified femur, initial encounter for closed fracture)。
11. **UGIB ___ requiring MICU admission i/s/o INR 14:** 這是一個重要的既往病史，涉及胃腸道出血和凝血功能異常。胃腸道出血應編碼為 K65.5 (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage)。INR 14 指出凝血功能異常，應編碼為 D68.69 (Other specified coagulation defects)。
12. **COPD:** 慢性阻塞性肺病。應編碼為 J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified)。
13. **Allergies: Hydrochlorothiazide / Penicillins:** 這些是重要的過敏史。氫氯噻嗪過敏應編碼為 Z88.0 (Allergy to diuretics)。青黴素過敏應編碼為 Z88.3 (Allergy to penicillin)。
14. **Back pain:** 這是主要的主訴，但由於有壓縮性骨折的診斷，背痛是壓縮性骨折的症狀，因此不需要單獨編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Abnormal eye movements (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴為異常眼球運動，且病史中提到右眼偏斜和右眼視力模糊，並在檢查中懷疑為內耳性眩暈 (INO)。INO 是一種神經學症候群，通常由腦幹或小腦的病變引起，導致眼球運動異常。因此，最直接的診斷是內耳性眩暈，對應 ICD-10 編碼 H55.1。
2.  **Pituitary macroadenoma s/p resection via craniotomy and radiation complicated by intracranial hemorrhage in 2017:** 患者有垂體巨腺瘤病史，並曾接受開顱手術和放射治療，且有術後顱內出血的併發症。這表明存在垂體腺瘤的後遺症，應編碼為 D33.1 (垂體腺瘤)。
3.  **Hypopituitarism:** 患者有垂體功能減退症，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 E23.2 (原發性腺垂體功能減退症)。
4.  **Bilateral ACA ischemic strokes:** 患者有雙側前大腦動脈 (ACA) 經驗性中風病史。這是一個重要的慢性神經學疾病，應編碼為 I67.2 (多發性腦梗塞)。
5.  **Seizure disorder:** 患者有癲癇症，這是一個重要的慢性神經學疾病，應編碼為 G40.909 (未特指的癲癇)。
6.  **Diabetes insipidus:** 患者有尿崩症，這是一個重要的慢性內分泌疾病，應編碼為 E22.3 (尿崩症)。
7.  **Right eye blurry vision and scratchy feeling:** 患者主訴右眼視力模糊和異物感，這屬於視力障礙和眼部不適，應編碼為 H53.10 (未特指的視力障礙) 和 H10.00 (未特指的結膜異物感)。
8.  **Right eye deviation:** 患者有右眼偏斜，這屬於眼球運動障礙，應編碼為 H53.11 (眼球運動障礙)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Peripheral arterial disease with left ___ toe ulcer and rest pain**:
    *   **Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)**: I70.20 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities without gangrene) is the most specific code for PAD without gangrene.
    *   **Left ___ toe ulcer**: L97.510 (Ulcer of unspecified toe, left foot) is the appropriate code for a toe ulcer on the left foot.
    *   **Rest pain**: R20.2 (Pain in limb) is a general code for pain in a limb, which can be used to represent rest pain in the context of PAD.
2.  **History of Present Illness: Recurrent left foot symptoms. Occasionally complains of pain in the left foot. It is difficult to fully assess her symptoms because her dementia has progressed. I am unable to fully determine whether she is having foot pain specifically at night to suggest resting ischemia.**:
    *   **Dementia**: F03.90 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance) is a general code for dementia without specifying the type or severity.
3.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left lower extremity angiogram, angioplasty with additional stenting in the distal SFA below area with prior stents**:
    *   **Angioplasty with stenting**: This procedure is a treatment for PAD and is not a diagnosis itself. It does not require a separate ICD-10 code for the procedure itself, as the diagnosis (PAD) is already coded.

总结出最合理的編碼集合：
*   I70.20 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities without gangrene)

逐步推理：
1.  **Failure to thrive (Chief Complaint):** 這是一個症狀，通常會有潛在的病因。在病歷中，患者有進食減少、嘔吐、體重下降等症狀，且有嚴重的貧血、低血壓、黃疸、發燒等，這些都指向一個嚴重的全身性疾病。因此，R63.4 (Malnutrition) 是一個合理的編碼，用來表示營養不良。
2.  **Breast cancer on tamoxifen:** 這是一個重要的既往病史。R97.8 (Other specified adverse effects of drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 用來表示藥物的不良反應。然而，病歷中沒有明確指出Tamoxifen的不良反應，而是將其作為病史。因此，Z85.3 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast) 是更合適的編碼，表示乳腺癌的個人病史。
3.  **Recent diagnosis of hemochromatosis:** 這是一個明確的診斷。E83.10 (Hemochromatosis, unspecified) 用來表示血色素沉著症。
4.  **Progressive weakness, ataxia, fatigue, spongy feet, wheelchair bound, transfer to wheelchair:** 這些症狀描述了患者的主要功能障礙。R27.0 (Ataxia) 用來表示共濟失调。R53.1 (Fatigue) 用來表示疲勞。R29.6 (Weakness) 用來表示虛弱。R29.8 (Other specified symptoms and signs) 用來表示其他未明確的症狀，如「spongy feet」。
5.  **MRI of the brain to evaluate for mets that was reportedly negative:** 這表明曾懷疑有轉移性病變，但結果為陰性。Z85.89 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm) 用來表示其他惡性腫瘤的個人病史。
6.  **B12 deficiency:** 這是一個明確的診斷。D51.9 (Pernicious anemia) 用來表示惡性貧血，這通常與維生素B12缺乏相關。
7.  **Ferritin elevated to 3000 with concern for hemochromatosis:** 這進一步支持了E83.10 (Hemochromatosis, unspecified) 的診斷。
8.  **Decreased oral intake, multiple episodes of non bloody non bilious emesis over the past 3 weeks:** 這些是導致營養不良和虛弱的直接原因。R11.10 (Nausea without vomiting) 用來表示噁心。R11.11 (Vomiting without nausea) 用來表示嘔吐。
9.  **Chills:** 這是一個症狀。R78.8 (Other specified signs and symptoms) 用來表示其他未明確的症狀。
10. **Cough productive of phlegm:** 這是一個症狀。R05.2 (Cough) 用來表示咳嗽。
11. **Intermittent constipation and diarrhea:** 這些是消化系統症狀。K59.00 (Constipation, unspecified) 用來表示便秘。K59.80 (Diarrhea, unspecified) 用來表示腹瀉。
12. **Hair thinning:** 這是一個症狀。R51.8 (Other specified hair disorders) 用來表示其他頭髮疾病。
13. **Heart rate is normally >100:** 這是一個體徵。R00.0 (Tachycardia) 用來表示心動過速。
14. **Hypotensive 68/45, HR 145, appeared unwell, patient felt dizzy, febrile to 101.4 in the ED:** 這些是急性症狀。R57.0 (Hypotension) 用來表示低血壓。R03.0 (Fever) 用來表示發燒。R42.1 (Dizziness) 用來表示眩暈。
15. **Scleral icterus:** 這是一個體徵。R17.0 (Icterus) 用來表示黃疸。
16. **Brown guaiac negative stool:** 這表明沒有消化道出血。K57.89 (Other specified functional gastrointestinal disorders) 用來表示其他未明確的功能性胃腸道疾病。

1.  **Chest pain, elevated troponins, and history of CAD s/p stent x4:** 這些是心肌梗死的強烈指標。患者有胸痛、肌鈣蛋白升高，且有冠狀動脈疾病史，這符合非 ST 段抬高型心肌梗死 (NSTEMI) 的診斷。因此，編碼 I21.4 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction) 是最合適的。
2.  **Crescendo angina over the past several weeks to months:** 這表示患者有心絞痛，且是導致心肌梗死的潛在原因。因此，編碼 I20.0 (Angina pectoris (angina equivalent)) 是必要的。
3.  **History of CAD s/p stent x4:** 這表示患者有冠狀動脈疾病史，且已進行了四次支架置入。這是一個重要的慢性病史，應編碼 I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Gi Bleed, Transfer**: 患者因胃腸道出血 (GIB) 轉院，且病歷中明確提到「maroon-colored guaiac-positive stool in his ostomy bag」，這表明是下消化道出血。因此，K62.0 (Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage) 是主要診斷。
2.  **Colon cancer (s/p resection and ostomy in ___, GIB (most recent ___)**: 患者有結腸癌病史，且最近一次 GIB 發生在結腸癌手術後。這表明 GIB 是由結腸癌引起的。因此，K55.21 (Malignant neoplasm of colon with secondary hemorrhage) 是適當的編碼。
3.  **CHF with EF 25% s/p VF arrest ___ (no ICD in place)**: 患者有心臟衰竭病史，射血分數 25%，且曾有心室顫動 (VF) 停搏史，目前沒有植入式心臟除顫器 (ICD)。這表明是慢性心臟衰竭。因此，I50.22 (Congestive heart failure, systolic) 是適當的編碼。
4.  **Multiple DVTs (including while on Coumadin and with life-threatening limb ischemia, now on Eliquis)**: 患者有多次深靜脈血栓病史，包括在服用華法林期間，且曾有威脅生命肢體缺血，目前服用利伐沙班。這表明是深靜脈血栓形成。因此，I82.9 (Deep vein thrombosis, unspecified) 是適當的編碼。
5.  **Progressive feeling of tiredness over the last two months, as well as dyspnea on exertion after walking ___ years**: 患者有進展性疲勞和勞力性呼吸困難，這與心臟衰竭症狀相符。因此，R06.02 (Dyspnea) 和 R53.1 (Fatigue) 是適當的編碼。
6.  **Hematocrit dropped from 33-25**: 患者血紅細胞比容下降，這與胃腸道出血和貧血相關。因此，D62 (Anemia in chronic disease) 是適當的編碼。
7.  **Transfused 1U PRBC at OSH**: 患者接受了1單位紅血球輸注，這表明有貧血。因此，D62 (Anemia in chronic disease) 也涵蓋了貧血。
8.  **DNR/DNI**: 患者確認了不插管和不心肺復甦的指示。因此，Z61.1 (Do not resuscitate (DNR) status) 是適當的編碼。
9.  **Aspirin allergy**: 患者有阿司匹林過敏史。因此，Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin) 是適當的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **L ICA aneurysm (left internal carotid artery aneurysm):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是進行血管內栓塞手術的對象。ICD-10 編碼 I67.2 指的是腦動脈瘤，未指明部位，但由於病歷中明確指出是左側頸內動脈，因此更精確的編碼是 I67.21 (Left internal carotid artery aneurysm)。
2.  **Pipeline embolization of left ICA paraclinoid aneurysm:** 這是一種治療動脈瘤的介入性手術。ICD-10 編碼 Z99.89 指的是其他術後狀態，適用於手術後的恢復期。由於這是近期進行的治療，且患者仍在恢復中，因此 Z99.89 是合適的編碼。
3.  **Basilar aneurysm (基底動脈瘤):** 病歷中提到患者曾有基底動脈瘤，並在 ___ 進行了線圈栓塞治療。雖然目前的就診是針對頸內動脈瘤，但基底動脈瘤是其病史的一部分，且與其多發性動脈瘤的病史相關。因此，I67.22 (Basilar artery aneurysm) 應作為既往病史編碼。
4.  **History of lung cancer (肺癌病史):** 病歷中提到患者有肺癌病史，這與其基底動脈瘤的就診背景相關。因此，Z85.31 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung) 應作為既往病史編碼。
5.  **Smoking history (吸煙史):** 病歷中提到患者有吸煙史，這與其多發性動脈瘤的病史相關。因此，Z87.891 (Personal history of tobacco use) 應作為既往病史編碼。
6.  **Multiplicity of aneurysms (多發性動脈瘤):** 這是一個臨床描述，表明患者有多個動脈瘤。雖然 I67.2 已經涵蓋了動脈瘤本身，但 Z86.72 (Personal history of multiple aneurysms) 可以作為一個附加的既往病史編碼，以強調其多發性特徵。
7.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions (無已知過敏史/不良藥物反應):** 這是一個否定性資訊，通常不需要編碼，除非有特定的過敏史需要記錄。在本例中，沒有具體的過敏史，因此不需要編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
I67.21 (Left internal carotid artery aneurysm), Z99.89 (Other postprocedural state), I67.22 (Basilar artery aneurysm), Z85.31 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung), Z87.891 (Personal history of tobacco use), Z86.72 (Personal history of multiple aneurysms)

7.  **Encephalopathy, poor PO intake, increased lower extremity weakness**：這些是急性症狀，與失智症的急性惡化或腦病變相關。R41.82 已涵蓋急性腦病變，R42.10 (Anorexia) 覆蓋食慾不振，R27.0 (Weakness) 覆蓋全身性虛弱。
8.  **Visual hallucinations at baseline, increased frequency over the past few days**：基線幻覺是失智症的一部分，但近期頻率增加可能與急性腦病變或藥物影響相關。R41.82 已涵蓋急性腦病變，R29.6 (Hallucinations) 覆蓋幻覺。
9.  **Tried to jump out of the car today while driving to the ED**：這是一個自傷行為，與急性意識狀態改變和幻覺相關。R41.82 已涵蓋急性腦病變，R45.811 (Attempted self-harm) 覆蓋自傷嘗試。

逐步推理：
1.  **Adenosquamous carcinoma of gallbladder (膽囊腺鱗癌)**: 這是病人的主要診斷。ICD-10 編碼 C24.0 代表膽囊的惡性腫瘤，而 C24.0 本身是膽囊癌的總稱，不區分組織學類型。雖然病史中提到是腺鱗癌，但 ICD-10 沒有更細的子碼來區分腺鱗癌，因此 C24.0 是最合適的選擇。
2.  **Fatigue (疲勞)**: 這是病人的主訴之一，且持續存在。ICD-10 編碼 R53.83 代表其他類型的疲勞。
3.  **Fever (發燒)**: 這是病人的主訴之一，且持續存在。ICD-10 編碼 R50.9 代表未指明的發燒。
4.  **Malaise (全身不適)**: 這是病人的主訴之一，且持續存在。ICD-10 編碼 R53.81 代表全身不適。
5.  **Decreased appetite (食慾減退)**: 這是病人的主訴之一。ICD-10 編碼 R63.0 代表食慾減退。
6.  **Weight loss (體重減輕)**: 這是病人的主訴之一。ICD-10 編碼 R63.4 代表體重減輕。
7.  **Penicillins allergy (青黴素過敏)**: 這是病人的既往病史。ICD-10 編碼 Z91.011 代表青黴素類藥物過敏。
8.  **Previously healthy (先前健康)**: 這是一個描述性短語，通常不編碼，除非有特定的健康狀態需要編碼。在這種情況下，沒有其他健康狀態被提及，因此不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **G1 (Gravida 1)**: 這表示患者是第一次懷孕。雖然這不是一個診斷，但它是產科病歷中重要的背景資訊，通常會在產科診斷編碼中反映。在 ICD-10 中，Z3A.00 用於表示懷孕 0-12 周，Z3A.10 用於 13-27 周，Z3A.20 用於 28-39 周，Z3A.30 用於 40-43 周，Z3A.40 用於 44-46 周，Z3A.50 用於 47-49 周，Z3A.60 用於 50-52 周。患者目前是 32+4 周，因此 Z3A.20 是最合適的編碼。
2.  **cHTN (chronic hypertension)**: 患者有慢性高血壓病史，且目前血壓為 160/100，這屬於妊娠期高血壓疾病。在 ICD-10 中，妊娠期高血壓疾病通常編碼為 O10.00 (Pregnancy-induced hypertension, unspecified, without proteinuria)。由於患者有慢性高血壓病史，且目前血壓升高，O10.00 是最合適的編碼。
3.  **Labetalol at 11w**: 患者正在服用 Labetalol 來控制高血壓。這表示患者正在接受高血壓的藥物治療。在 ICD-10 中，Z91.01 (Long term (current) use of antihypertensive drugs) 用於表示長期使用降壓藥物。
4.  **BP 160/100 at ___ visit today**: 患者目前的血壓為 160/100，這屬於高血壓危象。在 ICD-10 中，高血壓危象通常編碼為 I16.0 (Hypertensive crisis)。
5.  **Pt denies HA, visual changes**: 患者否認頭痛和視力變化，這排除了子癇前期的症狀。
6.  **Occasionally has RUQ pain, but not currently - usually bothersome only at night**: 患者偶有右上腹痛，但目前沒有。這描述了膽囊炎的症狀，但由於患者否認目前有疼痛，且沒有進一步的診斷（如膽囊炎或膽結石），因此不編碼。
7.  **Denies CP/SOB**: 患者否認胸痛和呼吸困難，這排除了心臟或呼吸系統的急性問題。
8.  **Denies CTX, VB or LOF**: 患者否認陰道出血或流產，這排除了這些問題。
9.  **+AFM**: 患者有胎動。這表示胎兒存活，通常不需要編碼，除非有胎動減少或停止的問題。
10. **c. section (cesarean section)**: 患者將進行剖腹產。這是一個手術程序，通常在病例中作為主要手術或侵入性程序列出，而不是診斷編碼。因此，不編碼為 ICD-10 診斷碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: GI bleed** - 患者主訴為胃腸道出血，病歷中描述為「bright red blood per rectum」和「maroon colored stools」，這指向下消化道出血。因此，K62.5 (Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage) 是一個主要診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: chronic hyponatremia** - 患者有慢性低鈉血症病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。E87.1 (Hyponatremia) 是正確的編碼。
3.  **History of Present Illness: symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM** - 患者有症狀性心搏過緩，並已植入心臟起搏器。I44.8 (Other specified cardiac arrhythmias) 用於症狀性心搏過緩，Z95.81 (Presence of cardiac pacemaker) 表示心臟起搏器的存在。
4.  **History of Present Illness: PAD s/p revascularization earlier this year** - 患者有周邊動脈疾病，並已進行血管重建手術。I70.21 (Atherosclerosis of lower extremity arteries with intermittent claudication) 用於周邊動脈疾病伴間歇性跛行，Z95.82 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft) 表示血管重建手術的存在。
5.  **History of Present Illness: right lower extremity cellulitis** - 患者在右下肢有蜂窩性組織炎。L03.111 (Cellulitis of right lower leg) 是正確的編碼。
6.  **History of Present Illness: CTA of the chest was suggestive of subsegmental pulmonary embolism** - 患者有肺栓塞。I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified) 是正確的編碼。
7.  **History of Present Illness: broad-spectrum antibiotics with clindamycin and meropenem due to allergies** - 患者因過敏而使用廣譜抗生素，這表明存在感染。R89.8 (Other abnormal findings of laboratory chemical studies) 用於描述實驗室檢查結果異常，但在此情境下，更直接的診斷是感染本身，因此 A41.9 (Unspecified sepsis) 可能更合適，但病歷中未明確提及敗血症，因此 R89.8 作為實驗室異常的結果更為恰當。
8.  **History of Present Illness: transfused 1U PRBCs** - 患者輸血，這是一個重要的治療措施，Z99.8 (Other specified transfusion status) 用於表示輸血狀態。
9.  **Allergies: Penicillins / Levaquin / adhesive tape / Band-Aid Clear Spots / Bactrim / Keflex / vancomycin / Bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite)** - 患者有多種過敏史。Z88.2 (Allergy to penicillin) 用於青黴素過敏，Z88.8 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 用於其他藥物過敏，Z88.9 (Allergy to unspecified drug, medicament and biological substance) 用於未指明的過敏。
10. **History of Present Illness: bipolar disease** - 患者有躁鬱症病史。F31.9 (Bipolar affective disorder, current episode unspecified) 是正確的編碼。
11. **History of Present Illness: febrile** - 患者發燒，R50.9 (Fever, unspecified) 是正確的編碼。
12. **History of Present Illness: lower abdominal pain, associated with nausea** - 患者有下腹痛和噁心，R10.11 (Abdominal pain, lower quadrant) 和 R11.0 (Nausea) 是正確的編碼。
13. **History of Present Illness: maroon stool that was heme positive** - 患者有血便，K62.5 已涵蓋此症狀。
14. **History of Present Illness: transfused 1U PRBCs** - 患者輸血，Z99.8 已涵蓋此治療措施。
15. **History of Present Illness: CTA of the chest was suggestive of subsegmental pulmonary embolism** - 患者有肺栓塞，I26.9 已涵蓋此診斷。
16. **History of Present Illness: broad-spectrum antibiotics with clindamycin and meropenem due to allergies** - 患者因過敏而使用廣譜抗生素，R89.8 已涵蓋此實驗室異常。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: neck and arm pain/dysesthesias**：這是患者就診的主要原因，但通常不是最終診斷，而是症狀。需要進一步鑑別其根本原因。
2.  **History of Present Illness: worsening neck and arm pain/dysesthesias**：症狀持續惡化，提示存在潛在的神經壓迫或退化性病變。
3.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ___ C5-C7**：手術部位是頸椎C5-C7，這通常與脊髓或神經根壓迫相關，例如頸椎間盤突出、脊髓病變或退化性脊椎病變。
4.  **Determined they would be a good candidate for ___ C5-C7**：手術決策是基於患者症狀和影像學檢查結果，進一步支持存在需要手術治療的頸部病變。
5.  **Review of the patients history and physical examination in the office, as well as radiographic studies**：影像學檢查結果是手術決策的關鍵，通常會顯示出退化性脊椎病變、椎間盤突出或脊髓病變等。

最合理的編碼集合：
*   **M47.16** (Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy)：頸椎退化性病變伴脊髓病變。這是一個常見的導致頸部疼痛、手臂疼痛和感覺異常的退化性脊椎病變，且是需要手術治療的指徵。
*   **G82.00** (Spastic paraplegia, unspecified)：脊髓性痲痺，未特指。這是一個描述脊髓病變導致的症狀，與頸椎退化性病變伴脊髓病變 (M47.16) 有密切關聯。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Pelvic mass, constipation** - 這些是主要症狀，但需要根據病史和診斷來編碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Metastatic melanoma, currently on pembrolizumab therapy** - 這明確指出患者有轉移性黑色素瘤，且正在接受免疫治療。這對編碼至關重要。
3.  **Melanoma since ___, initially identified on his left leg. He has since had excision of an in-transit lesion of the left leg in ___, and a wedge biopsy of metastases to the lungs in ___** - 這表明黑色素瘤最初出現在左腿，並已轉移到肺部和骨盆。因此，C43.5 (Melanoma of left leg) 和 C78.7 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung) 是必要的。
4.  **He was thereafter treated with ipilimumab, which was discontinued due to autoimmune thyroiditis and hypophysitis. He recently began treatment with pembrolimumab after finding progression of his disease with a pelvic mass.** - 這表明患者正在接受 pembrolizumab 治療，且由於疾病進展而需要手術。C97.9 (Malignant neoplasm of unspecified site) 用於表示轉移性黑色素瘤的未明確部位，而 Z51.11 (Encounter for antineoplastic therapy) 表示抗腫瘤治療的就診。
5.  **While on therapy, he began to experience constipation (since ___ and CT at that time demonstrated growth of the pelvic mass. He was planning to see Dr. ___ as an outpatient in consultation regarding this mass but was admitted in the interim with worsened constipation. Repeat CT on this admission again showed growth of the mass.** - 這表明患者因惡性腫瘤引起的便秘就診，且骨盆腫瘤在 CT 上顯示生長。K59.00 (Constipation, unspecified) 用於表示便秘，而 C79.5 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of pelvis) 用於表示骨盆的轉移性腫瘤。
6.  **Allergies: Celebrex** - 這表示患者對塞來昔布過敏，應編碼為 Z91.012 (Allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID)。
7.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pelvic mass resection and low anterior resection** - 這些是手術程序，通常在 ICD-10-PCS 中編碼，但由於問題僅要求 ICD-10 編碼，因此不在此處列出。

逐步推理：
1.  **Descending left colon cancer (主要診斷):**  C18.6 (Malignant neoplasm of descending colon)。這是病人的主要診斷，也是手術的原因。
2.  **Adenocarcinoma of the duodenum (既往病史):**  C20.9 (Malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of duodenum)。病史中提到患者曾接受 Whipple 手術治療十二指腸腺癌，這是一個重要的既往病史。
3.  **Adenocarcinoma (腫瘤類型):**  D00-D99 系列中，C18.6 已經明確了腫瘤的部位和性質，因此不需要額外編碼。
4.  **Genetic workup (基因檢查):**  Z85.89 (Family history of other specified genetic disorders)。病史中提到患者已進行了廣泛的基因檢查，但未發現特定的基因缺陷。這表明存在遺傳性疾病的家族史，因此編碼 Z85.89 是合適的。
5.  **Aspirin / NSAIDS / anticoagulants allergy (過敏史):**  Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin), Z91.012 (Allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。患者對阿司匹林、NSAIDs 和抗凝血劑過敏，這些都應編碼。
6.  **Laparoscopic left colectomy (主要手術):**  Z40.01 (Encounter for surgical aftercare of colon)。這是手術後的隨訪，因此編碼為 Z40.01。
7.  **Staging CT scan (分期 CT 扫描):**  Z85.89 (Family history of other specified genetic disorders) 已經涵蓋了分期檢查的目的，因此不需要額外編碼。
8.  **No evidence of metastatic disease (無轉移證據):**  這是一個陰性發現，通常不需要編碼，除非有特定的陰性結果需要記錄。
9.  **Surveillance colonoscopy (篩查性結腸鏡檢查):**  Z12.11 (Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of colon)。這是發現腫瘤的檢查，因此編碼為 Z12.11。

1.  **Cough (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴是咳嗽，這是一個症狀。在沒有明確診斷為慢性咳嗽或特定病因的情況下，R05.2 (Cough) 是最合適的編碼。
2.  **Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe (LUL):** 這是病歷中明確提到的診斷，且是主要的治療原因。C34.11 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, left bronchus or lung) 是左肺上葉鱗狀細胞癌的正確 ICD-10 編碼。
3.  **Extension of the mass into the 1st rib (initial concern):** 這是病歷中提到的腫瘤擴散的初步擔憂，儘管後續的 mediastinoscopy 未顯示第一肋骨或胸壁受累，但這仍然是腫瘤的擴散部位。C79.51 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone and bone marrow) 是骨頭的繼發性惡性腫瘤的正確編碼。
4.  **PET showed concern for nodal disease:** 這表明存在淋巴結轉移的擔憂。C78.6 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of mediastinum) 是中縱隔的繼發性惡性腫瘤的正確編碼。
5.  **Current smoker:** 患者是現用菸者，這是一個重要的風險因素。F17.210 (Nicotine dependence, current daily smoker) 是現用菸者的正確編碼。
6.  **H/o bladder cancer:** 患者有膀胱癌病史，這是一個重要的既往病史。Z85.51 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder) 是膀胱惡性腫瘤個人病史的正確編碼。
7.  **Interval CT Scan showed mild increase in the size of the tumor:** 這表明腫瘤在隨訪期間有所增大，這是一個重要的臨床發現。R86.0 (Finding of increased size of lesion) 是病變增大發現的正確編碼。
8.  **Mediastinoscopy:** 這是一個診斷性手術，用於評估腫瘤的擴散。Z49.1 (Encounter for diagnostic thoracoscopy) 是診斷性胸腔鏡檢查的正確編碼。
9.  **Left thoracotomy and left upper lobectomy:** 這是一個主要的外科手術。0BT00ZZ (Lobectomy of left lung, open approach) 是左肺葉切除術的正確編碼。
10. **Mediastinal lymph node dissection:** 這是一個主要的外科手術。06B00ZZ (Dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes, open approach) 是中縱隔淋巴結解剖的正確編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: mutism, L facial twitching** - 這些是主要症狀，但通常會被更精確的診斷所取代。
2.  **Past Medical History: fibromyalgia** - 慢性疼痛綜合症，編碼為 M79.6。
3.  **History of Present Illness: fall resulting in headache and speech difficulties** - 患者因跌倒導致頭痛和語言困難。頭痛是跌倒的直接結果，編碼為 R51.0 (Headache)。語言困難 (aphemia) 是神經系統症狀，編碼為 R47.0 (Aphasia)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: left lower face started twitching, this lasted several minutes and she subsequently noticed right-sided facial droop** - 左側面部抽搐和右側面部下垂是神經系統症狀，提示可能的中風或神經功能障礙。由於頭部CT和頸部CTA未發現異常，且患者在頭痛 cocktail 後症狀有所改善，這更可能是一種暫時性神經功能障礙，而非中風。因此，編碼為 R25.1 (Facial paresis)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: both of her hands were tremulous** - 手部震顫是神經系統症狀，編碼為 R25.8 (Other specified neurological symptoms)。
6.  **History of Present Illness: cough last week which she attributes to seasonal allergies** - 咳嗽是呼吸系統症狀，編碼為 R05.9 (Cough, unspecified)。
7.  **History of Present Illness: leukocytosis of 12** - 白血球增多是實驗室異常，編碼為 R72.8 (Other specified abnormal findings of blood count)。
8.  **Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins** - 藥物過敏史，編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin) 和 Z91.012 (Allergy to cephalosporin)。
9.  **History of Present Illness: fall onto her left side and hit her head. The fall appears mechanical in nature, she said the floor was slippery in the shower.** - 跌倒導致頭部受傷，編碼為 W19.XXXA (Unspecified fall, initial encounter) 作為外部原因，並編碼為 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence) 作為環境因素。
10. **History of Present Illness: headache cocktail at the outside hospital which improved to headache and improved her speech.** - 這表明頭痛 cocktail 有效，但頭痛和語言困難仍存在，因此 R51.0 和 R47.0 仍需保留。

7.  **Home health assistant:** 這是一個環境因素，可能與跌倒或意外有關，但病史中沒有提到跌倒或意外。因此，不需要編碼。

3.  **History of Present Illness: Exploratory laparotomy, extensive LOA, ileocolectomy with new ileocolic anastomosis formation, and incicisional hernia repair** - 這些是手術史，表明患者有小腸切除和吻合術的病史，以及腹壁疝修復史。這些手術史本身不是診斷，但會影響當前的診斷和編碼。
4.  **History of Present Illness: Remote history of small bowel resection and ?right colectomy with ileocolic anastomosis** - 這進一步強化了小腸切除和吻合術的病史。
5.  **History of Present Illness: Another admission from ___ for a small bowel obstruction that resolved with conservative management** - 這表明患者有小腸梗阻的病史，且曾因小腸梗阻入院。
6.  **History of Present Illness: 6 episodes a day of brown diarrhea** - 這是當前的主要症狀之一，且與膿腫的形成有關。
7.  **History of Present Illness: Large right lower quadrant abscess that is 7.5 x 4 cm in size** - 這是當前的主要診斷。膿腫是感染的表現，因此 K35.81 (Abscess of other specified parts of small intestine) 是一個合理的編碼。此外，膿腫的形成可能與腹瀉和腹痛有關，因此 K52.81 (Other specified functional gastrointestinal disorders) 也可以考慮，但 K35.81 更具體地描述了膿腫本身。
8.  **History of Present Illness: Ertapenem for a large right lower quadrant abscess** - 這表明膿腫是感染性的，因此 K35.81 是正確的編碼。
9.  **Allergies: Penicillins** - 這是一個重要的過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin).
10. **History of Present Illness: Mild abdominal tenderness** - 這是當前的症狀，但通常會被更明確的診斷所取代。
11. **History of Present Illness: Tolerating a diet and still passing gas** - 這表明患者目前的腸道功能尚可，但不能排除小腸梗阻的後遺症。
12. **History of Present Illness: Denies fevers or chills** - 這排除了某些感染性疾病的症狀。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   K35.81 (Abscess of other specified parts of small intestine) - 右下腹膿腫是當前的主要診斷。
*   K56.6 (Small intestinal obstruction, unspecified) - 小腸梗阻的病史和當前症狀。
*   Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin) - 青黴素過敏史。

逐步推理：
1.  **Complicated medical history including ___ polyposis-HHT overlap syndrome:** 這是一個複雜的遺傳性綜合徵，涉及多個器官系統。由於沒有更詳細的描述，最合理的編碼是 Z86.79 (Other specified personal history of other diseases and disorders) 來表示個人病史。
2.  **Adenocarcinoma s/p Whipple:** 這表示患者曾接受過 Whipple 手術治療腺癌。R09.89 (Other specified symptoms and signs following surgery) 用於表示手術後的其他症狀和體徵。
3.  **DVT/PE on apixaban:** 患者有深靜脈血栓和肺栓塞病史，並正在服用抗凝血劑。I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified) 用於肺栓塞，Z79.01 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants) 用於抗凝血劑的長期使用。
4.  **Chronic protein-losing enteropathy on chronic TPN:** 慢性蛋白質丟失性腸病和長期靜脈營養支持。K52.89 (Other specified intestinal diseases) 用於腸道疾病，Z76.01 (Long-term (current) use of enteral nutrition) 用於長期腸內營養。
5.  **Chronic anemia:** 慢性貧血。D64.9 (Anemia, unspecified)。
6.  **Recurrent bacteremia:** 反覆性菌血症。B95.9 (Unspecified organism as cause of diseases classified elsewhere) 用於未明確病原體的菌血症。
7.  **Fevers and rigors:** 發燒和寒戰。R50.9 (Fever, unspecified) 和 R68.8 (Other specified signs and symptoms)。
8.  **Allergies: dust,dogs,cats,horses / Dilaudid:** 對塵埃、狗、貓、馬和 Dilaudid 的過敏史。Z91.011 (Allergy to animal dander), Z91.012 (Allergy to animal hair), Z91.013 (Allergy to animal fur), Z91.014 (Allergy to animal feathers), Z91.019 (Allergy to other animal products) 用於對動物過敏，Z91.81 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 用於對 Dilaudid 的過敏。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Aneurysm** - 患者的主要主訴是動脈瘤，且後續的 MRA 確認了腦動脈瘤的存在。因此，I67.8 (Other cerebral aneurysm) 是主要診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: acute onset of left-sided hearing loss** - 患者有急性左耳聽力喪失，且後續的聽力測試顯示左耳聽力顯著喪失。這是一個重要的症狀，應編碼為 H91.13 (Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, left ear)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: previous similar episode on the right side** - 患者有右耳聽力喪失的病史，這表明有雙側的聽力問題。因此，H91.12 (Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, right ear) 也應編碼。
4.  **History of Present Illness: MRI of the brain was obtained to evaluate the internal auditory canal for an acoustic neuroma** - 雖然後續的影像學檢查未發現聽神經瘤，但這是一個重要的評估原因，應編碼為 R29.2 (Unspecified neurological symptom)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: possible enhancement in the ophthalmic segment of the left internal carotid artery** - 這是一個影像學發現，後續的 MRA 確認了腦動脈瘤，因此這個發現本身不需要單獨編碼。
6.  **History of Present Illness: hearing has improved after just three days of prednisone therapy** - 這表明聽力喪失是急性且可逆的，支持了 H91.13 和 H91.12 的編碼。
7.  **History of Present Illness: no neurological complaints. She denies headaches, weakness, numbness, tingling, diplopia or other concerning neurological findings.** - 患者否認其他神經學症狀，因此不需要編碼其他症狀。
8.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pipeline embo left ICA** - 這是一個手術程序，應編碼為 Z99.89 (Other specified surgical aftercare) 以表示術後照護。
9.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions** - 患者無已知過敏史，因此不需要編碼過敏。
10. **Attending: ___** - 這不是診斷或症狀，因此不需要編碼。

</think>
<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Patellar fracture after a fall at home (R knee):**  This is the primary reason for admission. The fracture is described as transverse, inferior, with minimal displacement, and non-operative management was recommended. The ICD-10 code for a displaced patellar fracture is S82.811A (Displaced fracture of right patella, initial encounter for closed fracture). Since the fracture is non-operative, this is the appropriate code.
2.  **Fever to 101:**  The patient was admitted to oncology for further evaluation of the fever. The fever is a significant symptom that led to admission. The ICD-10 code for fever of unspecified origin is R50.9.
3.  **Metastatic esophageal cancer s/p esophageal stenting, C2D1 ___ on ___:**  This is a chronic condition and the underlying reason for the patient's overall health status. The ICD-10 code for malignant neoplasm of the esophagus is C15.9 (Malignant neoplasm of esophagus, unspecified). Since it's metastatic, we also need to code the site of the metastasis. The patient has a metastatic lesion in the right patella, which is the reason for the patellar fracture. The ICD-10 code for malignant neoplasm of the patella is C40.8 (Malignant neoplasm of other specified sites of bone).
4.  **Hx of metastatic esophageal cancer s/p esophageal stenting:**  The patient has a history of esophageal stenting, which is a significant past procedure. The ICD-10 code for a history of esophageal stent is Z99.89 (Other specified personal history of other conditions and circumstances).
5.  **Weakness since his ___ cycle of chemotherapy:**  The patient reports generalized weakness, which is a significant symptom. The ICD-10 code for weakness is R53.1 (Weakness).
6.  **Struggles w/ constipation last was ___ days ago:**  The patient reports constipation, which is a significant symptom. The ICD-10 code for constipation is K59.00 (Constipation, unspecified).
7.  **Chest pain, worse w/ eating, taking pudding, liquids and rice:**  The patient reports chest pain, which is a significant symptom. The ICD-10 code for chest pain is R07.9 (Chest pain, unspecified).
8.  **Palliative XRT to metastatic lesion in R patella:**  The patient has received palliative radiation therapy for the metastatic lesion in the right patella. The ICD-10 code for palliative radiotherapy is Z51.11 (Encounter for palliative radiotherapy).
9.  **Oxycodone, Dilaudid, Oxycontin:**  These are medications the patient is taking. The ICD-10 code for the use of analgesics is Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of analgesics).
10. **History of falls:**  The patient has a history of falls, which is a significant risk factor. The ICD-10 code for history of falls is Z91.81 (History of fall).
11. **Living in ___ floor:**  The patient lives in a multi-story building, which is a risk factor for falls. The ICD-10 code for living in a multi-story building is Y92.019 (Other specified place of occurrence of external cause).
12. **Intermittent subjective fevers at home since last chemo:**  The patient has a history of intermittent fevers, which is a significant symptom. The ICD-10 code for fever of unspecified origin is R50.9.

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Dyspnea, hypoxia, and worsening shortness of breath:**  These are the primary presenting symptoms. Given the context of COPD and the recent exacerbation, the most specific code is **J44.1 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation)**. This code captures the exacerbation of COPD, which is the underlying cause of the dyspnea and hypoxia.
2.  **COPD:**  The patient has a history of COPD, which is a chronic condition. This is captured by **J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified)**.
3.  **Cough, productive of sputum (whitish phlegm), and mild wheezing:**  These are symptoms of the COPD exacerbation and are included in the J44.1 code.
4.  **Orthopnea and PND:**  These are symptoms of heart failure. Given the patient's history of CAD, HTN, and CKD, and the presence of BLE edema, the most likely diagnosis is **I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified)**.
5.  **BLE edema:**  This is a symptom of heart failure and is included in the I50.9 code.
6.  **URI symptoms (sore throat and rhinorrhea):**  These are acute symptoms that may be contributing to the exacerbation of COPD. They are captured by **J00 (Acute upper respiratory infections)**.
7.  **CAD (Coronary Artery Disease):**  This is a chronic condition. The most specific code is **I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)**.
8.  **HTN (Hypertension):**  This is a chronic condition. The most specific code is **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**.
9.  **CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident):**  This is a chronic condition. The most specific code is **I69.89 (Other late effects of cerebrovascular disease)**.
10. **PVD (Peripheral Vascular Disease):**  This is a chronic condition. The most specific code is **I70.20 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities without gangrene)**.
11. **Afib (Atrial Fibrillation):**  This is a chronic condition. The most specific code is **I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)**.
12. **CKD stage III:**  This is a chronic condition. The most specific code is **N18.3 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3)**.
13. **DM type II:**  This is a chronic condition. The most specific code is **E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)**.
14. **Warfarin use:**  This is a medication. The most specific code is **Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)**.
15. **Torsemide use:**  This is a medication. The most specific code is **Z79.4 (Long term (current) use of diuretics)**.
16. **Advair and albuterol inhaler use:**  These are medications. The most specific code is **Z79.89 (Other long term (current) use of other drugs and biological substances)**.
17. **Recent admission for COPD exacerbation:**  This is a history of a recent event. The most specific code is **Z86.72 (Personal history of other chronic lower respiratory disease)**.

</think>

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Left shoulder skin redness (主要主訴)**：這是患者就診的主要原因，且後續診斷為左臂蜂窩性組織炎。因此，L03.111 (Cellulitis of left shoulder) 是最直接的編碼。
2.  **Left arm cellulitis (診斷)**：明確診斷為蜂窩性組織炎，且位於左臂。L03.111 (Cellulitis of left shoulder) 已涵蓋左肩，但左臂的蜂窩性組織炎可能需要更精確的編碼。然而，L03.111 已經是左肩的蜂窩性組織炎，而左臂的蜂窩性組織炎可能被視為左肩蜂窩性組織炎的擴展或更嚴重的表現。在沒有進一步明確部位（如左上臂、左前臂）的情況下，L03.111 仍是最合理的選擇。
3.  **Worsening cellulitis despite outpatient antibiotics (病史描述)**：這表明蜂窩性組織炎是急性且正在惡化的，因此 L03.111 (Cellulitis of left shoulder) 是正確的急性蜂窩性組織炎編碼。
4.  **Status post Left shoulder arthroscopy, biceps tenodesis, subacromial decompression (手術)**：這些是手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
5.  **Penicillins / latex (過敏史)**：這些是患者的過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin) 和 Z91.818 (Allergy to other specified substances)。
6.  **History of Present Illness: ... presenting ~1 week post-op from a left shoulder arthroscopy with subacromial decompression and biceps tenodesis (病史)**：這表明患者有肩部的慢性或術後狀態，但沒有明確的慢性疾病診斷。因此，不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **R hip pain (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，但由於有明確的骨折診斷，這通常會被骨折診斷所涵蓋，因此不需要單獨編碼。
2.  **Right intertrochanteric femur fracture (History of Present Illness):** 這是患者就診的核心問題。根據 ICD-10 編碼，股骨粗隆間骨折的代碼是 S72.16。由於是右側，需要加上 7 來表示右側，因此正確的代碼是 S72.167。
3.  **s/p mechanical ground level fall (History of Present Illness):** 這是導致骨折的外部原因。機械性地面跌倒的 ICD-10 編碼是 W16.0XXA，表示首次發生的機械性地面跌倒。由於是導致骨折的直接原因，需要編碼。
4.  **otherwise healthy (History of Present Illness):** 這表示患者沒有其他已知的慢性疾病或共病，因此不需要編碼其他診斷。

逐步推理：
1.  **Back pain (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴是背部疼痛，這是一個症狀。由於病史中提到是 T9 椎體的病變，且有放射治療，因此背部疼痛是 T9 病變的症狀，而不是獨立的診斷。因此，不單獨編碼 R20 (Back pain)。
2.  **T9 lesion (History of Present Illness):** 病史中明確提到 T9 椎體的病變，且有放射治療。這表明存在一個脊椎的病變，最合理的診斷是脊椎的惡性腫瘤。由於沒有進一步的具體類型（如骨肉瘤、轉移性腫瘤等），使用 M899.0 (Malignant neoplasm of vertebra, unspecified) 作為脊椎惡性腫瘤的未特指類型。
3.  **Radiation to T9 lesion (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個治療程序，不是診斷。因此，不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
4.  **Muscle relaxants allergy (Allergies):** 患者對肌肉鬆弛劑過敏，這是一個重要的病史資訊。應編碼為 Z91.012 (Allergy to muscle relaxants)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: buttock pain** - 這是症狀，但病史中明確指出是「right buttock cellulitis」，因此應優先編碼診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: right buttock cellulitis** - 這是主要診斷。由於患者有「necrotizing soft tissue infection」的擔憂，且「subcutaneous emphysema」被提及，這指向了更嚴重的感染類型。因此，最合適的編碼是 **L03.111 (Cellulitis of right buttock with necrotizing fasciitis)**。
3.  **History of Present Illness: attempted to open the area with a scalpel at home** - 這是一個自傷行為，導致了感染的加重或複雜化。應編碼為 **Y87.89 (Other specified adverse effect of other specified intentional self-harm)**。
4.  **History of Present Illness: history of axillary abscesses which he has self-treated with incision and drainage** - 這是一個慢性病史，表示患者有反覆的膿腫問題。應編碼為 **L03.119 (Cellulitis of other specified site with abscess)**。
5.  **History of Present Illness: remote history of a buttock abscess versus pilonidal cyst ___ years ago that was managed with incision and drainage in an ED/urgent care setting** - 這是一個過去的病史，表示患者有既往的膿腫或肛裂囊問題。應編碼為 **L03.119 (Cellulitis of other specified site with abscess)**。
6.  **Allergies: clindamycin** - 這是患者的過敏史，應編碼為 **Z91.011 (Allergy to clindamycin)**。
7.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Incision and drainage of left buttock abscess** - 這是一個手術程序，但病史中描述的是「right buttock cellulitis」，而手術是針對「left buttock abscess」。這可能是一個矛盾，但根據病史描述，主要的診斷和手術是針對右側。因此，手術本身不應編碼為診斷，而是作為手術程序記錄。

逐步推理：
1.  **RUL Lung Nodule (Right Upper Lobe Lung Nodule):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，且PET掃描顯示為FDG-avid，提示惡性可能性。因此，最合理的編碼是 R91.81 (Abnormal findings on imaging of the lung, unspecified) 來表示肺部異常發現，並使用 C34.11 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, right bronchus or lung) 來表示右上葉肺癌。
2.  **Chest Pain:** 患者因胸痛就診，且CCTA排除了心臟、動脈瘤和胃腸道原因。因此，編碼 R07.9 (Unspecified chest pain) 是合適的。
3.  **Atrial Fibrillation (on eliquis):** 患者有心房顫動病史，且正在服用Eliquis。編碼 I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation) 用於心房顫動本身，Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants) 用於抗凝血劑的長期使用。
4.  **CAD s/p stent placement:** 患者有冠狀動脈疾病病史，且已放置支架。編碼 I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 用於冠狀動脈疾病，Z95.5 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft) 用於支架的存在。
5.  **BPH s/p TURP:** 患者有良性前列腺增生病史，且已進行經尿道前列腺切除術。編碼 N40.1 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia) 用於良性前列腺增生，Z90.4 (Presence of other artificial urinary sphincter) 用於手術後的狀態。
6.  **Right thoracotomy, right upper lobectomy:** 這是主要的外科手術。編碼 0BT00ZZ (Lobectomy of right upper lobe, open approach) 用於右上葉切除術，0W990ZZ (Insertion of chest tube, open approach) 用於胸腔引流管放置。
7.  **Right pleural chest tube placement:** 這是手術的一部分，編碼 0W990ZZ 已涵蓋。
8.  **Left PICC placement:** 這是手術的一部分，編碼 36555 (Insertion of central venous catheter) 用於中心靜脈導管放置。
9.  **Fiberoptic ENT exam:** 這是手術的一部分，編碼 Z01.818 (Encounter for other specified special examinations) 用於其他特殊檢查。
10. **Former smoker:** 患者有吸煙史，編碼 Z87.89 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) 用於其他個人疾病史。
11. **Non-exertional chest pain, musculoskeletal in nature:** 這是胸痛的描述，編碼 R07.9 已涵蓋。
12. **Unresponsive to nitroglycerin:** 這是胸痛的描述，編碼 R07.9 已涵蓋。

逐步推理：
1.  **Unintentional Overdose (Chief Complaint):** 患者因「非自願性過量服用」而就診，這是一個主要的診斷。在 ICD-10 中，這通常會編碼為 T46.0X5A (Accidental (unintentional) poisoning by paracetamol, undetermined intent, initial encounter)。由於是「非自願性」，且「意圖未明」，因此選擇 T46.0X5A。
2.  **14,500 mg Tylenol ingestion:** 這是導致中毒的具體藥物。T46.0X5A 已經涵蓋了對乙醯胺基酚 (Paracetamol) 的中毒，因此不需要額外編碼。
3.  **Abdominal Pain:** 患者主訴腹痛，這是中毒的症狀。在 ICD-10 中，腹痛通常編碼為 R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified)。
4.  **Nausea:** 患者有噁心，這是中毒的症狀。在 ICD-10 中，噁心通常編碼為 R117 (Nausea)。
5.  **No Known Past Medical History:** 患者沒有已知的既往病史，因此不需要編碼任何慢性疾病。
6.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼任何相關的 ICD-10 編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **HFrEF (EF 14%)**: 這是一個心臟衰竭的診斷，且射出分數低於 40%。I425 是心臟衰竭，未指明為急性或慢性，但由於患者有慢性病史，且本次就診是因症狀惡化，因此 I504 (慢性心臟衰竭伴急性失代償) 更為合適。
2.  **Atrial fibrillation (not on AC)**: 這是心房顫動，且未使用抗凝血劑。I489 是心房顫動，未指明為急性或慢性，但由於是慢性病史，I489 是最合適的。
3.  **CKD (~Cr 4)**: 這是慢性腎臟病，肌酐值約為 4，表示腎功能嚴重受損。N185 是慢性腎臟病，第 4 期 (G4)。
4.  **History of PEA arrest in setting of aspiration in ___**: 這是心臟停跳的病史，且與誤吸有關。R990 是心臟停跳的後遺症。
5.  **Recent admission ___ with hypoxia and tachypnea, and E coli UTI sepsis**: 這是最近的就診記錄，顯示有低氧血症、呼吸急促、大腸桿菌泌尿道感染和敗血症。R0602 是低氧血症，R0601 是呼吸急促，N390 是泌尿道感染，A4151 是大腸桿菌引起的敗血症。
6.  **Dyspnea and tachypnea**: 這是本次就診的主要主訴。R0602 是低氧血症，R0601 是呼吸急促。
7.  **Bilateral pleural effusions**: 這是雙側胸腔積液。J90 是胸腔積液，未指明為急性或慢性。
8.  **Potential pneumonia**: 這是潛在的肺炎。J189 是未指明的肺炎。
9.  **Aspiration risk**: 這是誤吸風險。R990 是心臟停跳的後遺症，也與誤吸風險相關。
10. **Speech and swallow evaluation due to aspiration risk**: 這是吞嚥困難的評估。R1310 是吞嚥困難。
11. **Evaluation by speech and swallow because there was concern for aspiration risk**: 這是吞嚥困難的評估。R1310 是吞嚥困難。
12. **Nursing home, he was going to have it taken out but they kept in after recent concerns for aspiration in case he needed it in the future**: 這是胃造瘻管的存在。Z938 是胃造瘻管的存在。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pain and heaviness since 8pm last night, unrelenting and slightly worsening, not exertional, present at rest, same as prior MIs:** 這描述了心絞痛的特徵，特別是與既往心肌梗死相似。因此，I25.10 (Angina pectoris, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼。
2.  **Tachycardic and markedly hypertensive:** 這表示存在高血壓危象。I16.0 (Hypertensive crisis) 是一個合適的編碼。
3.  **Positive D-dimer, concern for PE:** 這表示存在肺栓塞的風險。R07.89 (Other chest pain) 可以用來描述胸痛，但由於有肺栓塞的疑慮，R07.89 不是最佳選擇。然而，最終的 TEE 和 V/Q scan 結果未明確顯示肺栓塞，因此不能直接編碼 I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified)。R07.89 仍可作為胸痛的補充。
4.  **Concern for aortic dissection:** 這表示存在主動脈夾層的風險。I71.4 (Aortic dissection, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼，即使最終檢查未發現，但這是入院時的重要考慮。
5.  **Right leg pain and right hip pain, car accident in ___, never had right hip imaged:** 這描述了右腿和右髖部的疼痛，與既往車禍相關。M25.56 (Other specified pain in joint) 是一個合適的編碼。
6.  **Creatinine 3.0 (up from 2.5 baseline):** 這表示腎功能不全。N18.6 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5) 是一個合適的編碼。
7.  **Prior MIs:** 這表示有心肌梗死的病史。I25.2 (Old myocardial infarction) 是一個合適的編碼。
8.  **Heparin gtt started:** 這表示使用了抗凝劑。Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants) 是一個合適的編碼。
9.  **Esmolol for BP control:** 這表示使用了降壓藥。Z79.02 (Long term (current) use of antihypertensive drugs) 是一個合適的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Bilateral leg pain and swelling with drainage, redness, and inability to walk:** 這些症狀描述了雙腿的嚴重感染。由於患者有糖尿病史，且有創傷史（L膝關節化膿性關節炎和金黃色葡萄球菌菌血症），這些症狀最符合糖尿病足部感染。因此，編碼為 **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic foot syndrome with ulceration and infection)**。
2.  **Large amounts of drainage from wounds on both legs:** 這進一步支持了糖尿病足部感染的診斷，並強調了潰瘍和感染的存在。
3.  **Subjective fevers and chills for the past year, more daily for the past month:** 這些是全身性感染的症狀，與糖尿病足部感染的全身性表現一致。
4.  **Orthostatic symptoms, poor eating habits, chronic fatigue, naps frequently throughout the day:** 這些是糖尿病的慢性併發症，表明患者有糖尿病的全身性影響。
5.  **Chronic constipation, last BM was 6 days ago, saw ""a fair amount"" of blood come out:** 這描述了慢性便秘和便血，這在糖尿病患者中是常見的併發症。因此，編碼為 **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic foot syndrome with ulceration and infection)** 和 **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified)**。
6.  **New substernal chest pain for the past few months, occurring almost daily:** 這描述了心絞痛，是冠狀動脈疾病的一種表現。因此，編碼為 **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)** 和 **R071 (Angina pectoris)**。
7.  **Chronic dyspnea on exertion that has progressively worsened over the last few years:** 這描述了呼吸困難，是心臟或肺部疾病的症狀。由於患者有冠狀動脈疾病，這可能與心臟功能不全有關。因此，編碼為 **R0602 (Dyspnea)**。
8.  **Itchy bumps on his trunk and arms, unsure how long it's been present but thinks it may be from mites from parakeets he has:** 這描述了皮膚瘙癢，可能是由跳蚤或塵蟎引起的。因此，編碼為 **L350 (Pruritus)**。
9.  **History of HTN (Hypertension):** 這是患者的慢性病史。因此，編碼為 **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**。
10. **History of obesity:** 這是患者的慢性病史。因此，編碼為 **E669 (Obesity, unspecified)**。
11. **History of L knee septic arthritis and group A streptococcal bacteremia in the setting of hardware related complications:** 這些是患者的既往病史，但目前的就診主要是針對糖尿病足部感染。因此，這些病史可能不需要編碼，除非它們是當前就診的直接原因。
12. **History of mild cognitive delay:** 這是患者的慢性病史。因此，編碼為 **F79 (Unspecified intellectual disability)**。
13. **Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 沒有需要編碼的過敏史。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic foot syndrome with ulceration and infection)**: 糖尿病足部感染，是患者就診的主要原因。
*   **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified)**: 慢性便秘。
*   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)**: 冠狀動脈疾病。
*   **R071 (Angina pectoris)**: 心絞痛。
*   **R0602 (Dyspnea)**: 呼吸困難。
*   **L350 (Pruritus)**: 皮膚瘙癢。
*   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**: 高血壓。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: left arm weakness** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要進一步了解其病因。
2.  **History of Present Illness:***Neurology ED Code Stroke and Admission Note*** - 這是一個關鍵線索，表明患者因中風就診並入院。這直接指向中風的診斷。
3.  **Neurology ED Code Stroke and Admission Note** - 這句話明確指出患者因中風就診並入院，因此中風是主要的診斷。
4.  **Left arm weakness** - 這是中風的症狀，而不是獨立的診斷。在 ICD-10 中，症狀通常不單獨編碼，除非是主要診斷或需要進一步評估的症狀。
5.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions** - 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼相關的 ICD-10 編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease)**: 患者有終末期腎臟病史，且目前仍需血液透析。這應編碼為 N18.6 (End-stage renal disease)。
2.  **Hemodialysis**: 患者目前仍需血液透析，這是一個重要的治療方式，應編碼為 Z99.2 (Dependence on renal dialysis)。
3.  **Left deceased donor renal transplant**: 患者接受了左側捐贈者腎臟移植，這是一個重要的既往手術史，應編碼為 Z94.0 (Kidney transplant status)。
4.  **Neoureterocystostomy with double-J stent placed at time of transplant**: 患者接受了輸尿管膀胱吻合術並放置了雙J導管，這是一個重要的既往手術史，應編碼為 Z93.5 (Presence of urinary catheter)。
5.  **Alcoholic cirrhosis**: 患者有酒精性肝硬化病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 K70.30 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver without ascites)。
6.  **Liver transplant**: 患者有肝臟移植病史，這是一個重要的既往手術史，應編碼為 Z94.4 (Liver transplant status)。
7.  **AV loop graft placed in his left forearm**: 患者有左前臂的動脈靜脈回路移植物，這是一個重要的血管狀態，應編碼為 Z95.81 (Presence of arteriovenous shunt)。
8.  **Allergies: codeine / iodine / oxycodone / morphine**: 患者對嗎啡、可待因、氧可酮和碘有過敏史，這些都應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to morphine), Z91.012 (Allergy to codeine), Z91.013 (Allergy to oxycodone), 和 Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
9.  **Off insulin for >2 months**: 患者已超過2個月未使用胰島素，這表明他可能患有糖尿病，但病歷中未明確提及糖尿病診斷。因此，這一點不足以編碼為糖尿病，除非有進一步的證據支持。

逐步推理：
1.  **Left hip pain**: 這是患者就診的主要症狀，且後續進行了左側全髖關節置換術。因此，最直接的診斷是左側髖關節炎，對應 ICD-10 編碼 M16.11 (Unilateral primary osteoarthritis of left hip)。
2.  **Uncontrolled diabetes**: 患者有「未控制的糖尿病」病史，這是一個重要的共病，需要編碼。由於未明確指出是1型或2型，且未提及併發症，最合理的選擇是 E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。
3.  **Environmental allergies**: 患者有環境過敏史，這是一個重要的個人病史，需要編碼。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z88.8 (Allergy status to other specified agents)。

逐步推理：
1.  **N/V/D and abdominal pain x1 week**: 這些是主要的主訴和症狀。由於患者有胃食道逆流病史，且嘔吐和腹痛持續，且在嘔吐後仍持續，這指向胃食道逆流的惡化或併發症。因此，R1010 (Vomiting) 和 R1011 (Nausea) 是合理的。腹痛 R100 (Abdominal pain) 也應編碼。
2.  **Progressive n/v/d and inability to tolerate PO**: 這表明患者因症狀嚴重而無法進食，因此應編碼 R117 (Inability to tolerate food)。
3.  **Bowel irregularity since SBO one month ago**: 這表明患者有持續的腸道功能障礙，這與她的病史 SBO (小腸阻塞) 有關。因此，K560 (Postoperative ileus) 是合理的，表示手術後的腸道功能障礙。
4.  **Passing gas and last BM was this AM, which was diarrhea and feels like she can't control her bowels**: 這描述了腹瀉和排便失禁。因此，K520 (Diarrhea) 和 R158 (Incontinence) 是合理的。
5.  **Hx of NSTEMI w/ PCI with DES to LAD c/b ISR with thrombus in LAD with repeat stent**: 這表明患者有冠狀動脈疾病，包括支架植入和再狹窄。因此，I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 和 Z955 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft) 是合理的。ISR (支架內再狹窄) 通常被編碼為 I2510，因為它屬於動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病的範疇。
6.  **HTN**: 高血壓，編碼 I10。
7.  **HLD**: 高脂血症，編碼 E785。
8.  **DM2**: 2型糖尿病，編碼 E119。
9.  **Obesity**: 肥胖，編碼 E669。
10. **SBO s/p ex-lap and lysis of adhesions**: 小腸阻塞病史，已進行手術，因此編碼 K560 (Postoperative ileus) 和 Z9081 (History of other specified surgical procedure)。
11. **Unstable angina**: 不穩定型心絞痛，編碼 I201。
12. **Allergies**: 患者有多種藥物過敏史，應編碼為 Z9101 (Allergy to penicillin), Z9102 (Allergy to other antibiotic), Z9103 (Allergy to other drug), Z9104 (Allergy to other drug), Z9105 (Allergy to other drug), Z9106 (Allergy to other drug), Z9107 (Allergy to other drug), Z9108 (Allergy to other drug), Z9109 (Allergy to other drug)。這些編碼覆蓋了所有列出的過敏原。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: PV/SMV/Splenic vein thrombosis** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是導致其症狀（腹痛）的直接原因。因此，應編碼為 I81.10 (Portal vein thrombosis, unspecified)。雖然病歷中提到 SMV 和脾靜脈，但 I81.10 已涵蓋門靜脈及其主要分支的血栓。
2.  **History of Present Illness: HIV** - 患者有 HIV 病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 B20 (Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: Hepatitis B** - 患者有乙型肝炎病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 B18.1 (Chronic viral hepatitis B)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: Abdominal pain present since ___** - 腹痛是患者就診的主訴之一，且是血栓的症狀。應編碼為 R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: Pain worsened over the course of 3 days, is crampy in nature, and has spread from the lower abdomen to the central abdomen and back. The pain was exacerbated with eating.** - 這些描述進一步說明了腹痛的性質和位置，但 R109 已足夠涵蓋未特指的腹痛。
6.  **History of Present Illness: CT abdomen on admission was notable for thrombosis of the portal vein extending to the SMV and splenic vein.** - 這再次強化了 I81.10 的診斷。
7.  **History of Present Illness: He was started on systemic heparin.** - 這是一個治療措施，不是診斷。
8.  **History of Present Illness: ___ was consulted and took the patient today for transjugular transhepatic placement of lysis catheter into the portal vein. He was intubated for the procedure with plans to return to ___ for lysis check and possible thrombectomy ___.** - 這些是治療程序，不是診斷。

</think>

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Pink-tinged emesis (Chief Complaint):**  This is the primary reason for the visit.  The patient vomited twice with pink-tinged vomitus, which is a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).  Since the patient denies melena or hematochezia, and the vomitus is pink-tinged, this suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding.  The most appropriate code for this is **K92.11** (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, upper gastrointestinal tract).
2.  **Nausea:**  The patient reports feeling nauseous during his cardiology appointment and continues to feel nauseous upon arrival to the floor.  This is a symptom.  The appropriate code is **R11.0** (Nausea).
3.  **CAD s/p CABG last year:**  This is a significant past medical history.  The patient has coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).  The appropriate code for CAD is **I25.10** (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris).  The CABG is a procedure, not a diagnosis, so it doesn't require a separate ICD-10 code.
4.  **Child's A NASH/HBV cirrhosis with 3 cords of grade 1 varices in ___:**  This is a complex set of diagnoses.  The patient has cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatitis B virus (HBV).  The cirrhosis is the primary diagnosis.  The appropriate code for cirrhosis of the liver is **K74.60** (Cirrhosis of liver, unspecified).  The underlying causes of the cirrhosis are NASH and HBV.  NASH is coded as **K75.810** (Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis without cirrhosis).  HBV is coded as **B18.1** (Hepatitis B, chronic).  The presence of esophageal varices is a complication of cirrhosis.  The appropriate code for esophageal varices is **K76.60** (Esophageal varices, unspecified).
5.  **DMII:**  The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The appropriate code is **E11.9** (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications).
6.  **Allergies: Lipitor / OxyContin / lisinopril:**  These are drug allergies.  The appropriate code for each is **Z88.0** (Allergy to drug, unspecified) for each medication.  Since there are three medications, this code will be repeated three times.
7.  **No changes in bowel habits, denies f/c, CP/SOB:**  These are negative findings and do not require coding.

逐步推理：
1.  **Abdominal pain (Chief Complaint):** 這是主要症狀，但通常會有更具體的診斷。在病史中，患者描述了 RLQ (右下腹) 腹痛，並伴有其他症狀，這提示了急性闌尾炎的可能。
2.  **Crampy RLQ abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, non-bilious emesis, fevers, chills, malaise:** 這些症狀集合高度提示急性闌尾炎。闌尾炎的典型表現包括右下腹痛、發燒、噁心、嘔吐、腹瀉等。
3.  **Last had a colonoscopy a few years ago and believes that it was normal:** 這排除了結腸炎等其他可能的診斷。
4.  **CT-guided drainage of right lower quadrant and pelvic collections:** 這是一個手術程序，表明存在需要引流的腹腔內積液。這通常與闌尾炎引起的膿腫或腹膜炎相關。
5.  **Acute appendicitis (K35.80):** 這是患者最合理的診斷，因為其症狀和檢查結果都指向急性闌尾炎。
6.  **Acute appendicitis with localized abscess (K35.81):** 由於進行了引流手術，這表明闌尾炎已經發展為局部膿腫。
7.  **Acute appendicitis with perforation (K35.82):** 闌尾炎的膿腫通常表示穿孔，因此這個編碼也適用。
8.  **Acute appendicitis with peritonitis (K35.83):** 膿腫和腹膜炎通常會同時存在，因此這個編碼也合理。
9.  **Acute appendicitis with other complications (K35.89):** 這個編碼可以涵蓋其他未明確說明的併發症，例如腹腔內積液。
10. **Abdominal pain (R109):** 作為主要症狀，即使有更明確的診斷，也應編碼。
11. **Nausea (R117):** 作為症狀，應編碼。
12. **Diarrhea (R197):** 作為症狀，應編碼。
13. **Non-bilious emesis (R111):** 作為症狀，應編碼。
14. **Fever (R509):** 作為症狀，應編碼。
15. **Chills (R688):** 作為症狀，應編碼。
16. **Malaise (R538):** 作為症狀，應編碼。
17. **History of colonoscopy (Z87811):** 這是一個既往病史，應編碼。
18. **CT-guided drainage of right lower quadrant and pelvic collections (Z48811):** 這是一個手術後的狀態，應編碼。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Parasitic uterine fibroids (主要診斷)**: 這是一個複合診斷，包含子宮肌瘤和寄生性肌瘤。子宮肌瘤的 ICD-10 編碼是 D25.9 (Benign neoplasm of uterus, unspecified)。寄生性肌瘤是子宮肌瘤的一種特殊類型，通常會影響其他器官，如肝臟。由於病歷中提到「parasitic fibroid in the right quadrant above the uterus abutting the inferior aspect of the liver」，且「decision was made to proceed with a joint case with the Transplant team given concern that the parasitic fibroid may involve the liver」，這表明寄生性肌瘤已擴散到肝臟。因此，應編碼 D25.9 (子宮良性腫瘤) 和 D17.81 (肝臟良性腫瘤)。
2.  **Robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy in 2018 (既往手術史)**: 這是一個過去的診斷，通常不編碼為主要診斷，除非是當前就診的直接原因。在這種情況下，它提供了病史背景，但不是本次就診的主要原因。
3.  **Biopsy of a right upper quadrant mass, consistent with a leiomyoma (既往診斷)**: 這是一個過去的診斷，與 D25.9 (子宮良性腫瘤) 重複，因此不需要單獨編碼。
4.  **Pelvic ultrasound in 2020, showing a 9.5 cm anteverted uterus, 3.4 cm exophytic subserosal fibroid (既往診斷)**: 這也支持 D25.9 (子宮良性腫瘤) 的診斷。
5.  **Irregular bleeding (症狀)**: 這是子宮肌瘤的常見症狀，通常包含在 D25.9 的診斷中，因此不需要單獨編碼。
6.  **Definitive surgical management via removal of her uterus (主要手術)**: 這是一個治療措施，而不是診斷。
7.  **Allergies (過敏史)**: 這些是重要的患者資訊，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to aminoglycosides), Z91.012 (Allergy to antipsychotics), Z91.013 (Allergy to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), Z91.014 (Allergy to calcium channel blockers), Z91.019 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
8.  **History of hypertension (既往病史)**: 這是一個慢性疾病，應編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
9.  **History of osteoporosis (既往病史)**: 這是一個慢性疾病，應編碼為 M81.0 (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture)。
10. **History of ataxia (既往病史)**: 這是一個神經系統疾病，應編碼為 R27.0 (Ataxia)。
11. **History of recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls (既往病史)**: 這是一個骨科病史，應編碼為 M80.00 (Acute osteoporotic vertebral fracture without pathologic fracture, without mention of current pathological fracture)。

1.  **C6 of EPOCH (EPOCH regimen)**: 這是患者入院的主要原因，表示這是化療的第六週期。雖然 EPOCH 是一種治療方案，但其本身不是一個診斷，而是治療行為。因此，不直接對應 ICD-10 編碼。
2.  **Richter Transformation to DLBCL**: 這是一個重要的診斷，表示慢性淋巴細胞白血病 (CLL) 已經轉變為大B細胞淋巴瘤 (DLBCL)。這是一個複合診斷，需要同時編碼 CLL 和 DLBCL。
    *   **CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia)**: 這是一個慢性血液系統疾病，對應 ICD-10 編碼 C9190 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell type, unspecified).
    *   **DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma)**: 這是一個侵襲性淋巴瘤，對應 ICD-10 編碼 C8310 (Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, unspecified).
3.  **History of CLL and Richter Transformation to DLBCL**: 這些是患者的既往病史，但由於患者目前正在接受治療，且這些是導致入院的主要原因，因此應作為主要診斷而非個人病史。
4.  **Del(13q)**: 這是 CLL 的一個染色體異常，屬於 CLL 的一個亞型，通常會影響預後和治療選擇。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z8681 (Personal history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia).
5.  **Rai Stage I**: 這是 CLL 的分期，用於描述疾病的嚴重程度。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z8581 (Personal history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, stage I).
6.  **Anemia, Thrombocytopenia, Splenomegaly, Extensive Adenopathy**: 這些是 CLL 的相關症狀和體徵，通常會在 CLL 的診斷中包含，因此不需要單獨編碼。
7.  **PET suggestive of progressive CLL**: 這表明 CLL 的進展，這已經包含在 CLL 的診斷中。
8.  **Bone biopsy on ___ subsequently demonstrating Richter Transformation to DLBCL**: 這進一步確認了 Richter Transformation to DLBCL 的診斷。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Altered mental status (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要進一步鑑別其根本原因。在病史中，MRI發現了左額葉的大型病變，這被認為是導致症狀的原因。因此，R41.81 (Other specified altered mental status) 可能是症狀的編碼，但更根本的原因是病變本身。
2.  **Large left frontal lesion (MRI finding):** 這是導致患者症狀的根本原因。病史中未明確說明病變的性質，但由於是神經外科會診並進行了腫瘤切除手術，最合理的假設是腦腫瘤。因此，C71.0 (Malignant neoplasm of frontal lobe of brain) 是最合適的編碼。
3.  **Forgetfulness, lightheaded, episodes of urinary incontinence, disheveled, half naked, disorganized home, inappropriate laughter, inability to manage finances:** 這些都是腦腫瘤引起的症狀和體徵。R41.81 (Other specified altered mental status) 可以涵蓋這些症狀，但由於有明確的病變存在，通常會優先編碼病變本身。
4.  **Diagnostic cerebral angiogram and Bifrontal craniotomy for tumor resection (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這些是診斷和治療程序，通常不編碼為診斷碼，除非有併發症或後遺症。病歷中未提及手術併發症，因此不需要額外編碼。
5.  **Healthy, no significant medical hx:** 這表明患者沒有其他重要的慢性疾病或共病，因此不需要編碼其他診斷。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   C71.0 (Malignant neoplasm of frontal lobe of brain) - 這是導致患者症狀的根本原因，也是進行手術的直接原因。
*   R41.81 (Other specified altered mental status) - 用於描述患者就診時的主訴和症狀集合，即使有明確的病變存在，也常作為症狀碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chest Pain, R flank pain**: 這些是主要的主訴，但病史中提到這些症狀是因為肺栓塞和腎臟梗塞引起的。因此，症狀本身可能不需要單獨編碼，除非是主要診斷或需要特別關注的症狀。
2.  **Heterozygous factor V Leiden deficiency**: 這是一個遺傳性凝血障礙，屬於慢性疾病。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 D68.62 (Factor V deficiency)。
3.  **Hypertension**: 這是患者的慢性病史。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
4.  **Multiple DVTs and PEs on apixaban s/p IVC filter removal**: 患者有多次深靜脈血栓和肺栓塞病史，目前正在服用阿哌沙班。這表明存在慢性血栓栓塞疾病。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 I82.9 (Other deep vein thrombosis, unspecified site) 和 I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified)。
5.  **Bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli**: 這是本次就診的主要診斷之一。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified)。
6.  **R renal infarcts**: 這是本次就診的另一個主要診斷。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 N17.9 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified)。
7.  **IVC filter removal**: 這是一個手術程序，但不是診斷。因此，不需要編碼。
8.  **Apixaban**: 這是患者正在服用的藥物，但不是診斷。因此，不需要編碼。
9.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions**: 這表示患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應。因此，不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Lymphoblastic crisis of CML s/p allo RIC MUD in molecular remission currently on nilotinib and low dose prednisone:** 這是一個重要的慢性病史，表明患者患有慢性髓性白血病 (CML)。CML 的 ICD-10 編碼是 C92.00 (Chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1 positive, in remission)。由於患者正在接受治療 (nilotinib 和 prednisone)，且有「lymphoblastic crisis」的病史，這表明 CML 有急性變異的風險，因此應編碼 C92.01 (Chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1 positive, in blast crisis)。
2.  **Elevated LFTs, fatigue, nausea, non-blood vomiting, right hip pain:** 這些是主要的就診原因和症狀。肝功能異常 (elevated LFTs) 是一個重要的診斷，其 ICD-10 編碼是 R18.9 (Abnormal liver function, unspecified)。疲勞 (fatigue) 編碼為 R53.83 (Fatigue)。噁心 (nausea) 編碼為 R11.0 (Nausea)。非血性嘔吐 (non-blood vomiting) 編碼為 R11.10 (Vomiting, unspecified)。右髖疼痛 (right hip pain) 編碼為 M25.57 (Pain in other specified parts of hip)。
3.  **Lichen-appearing oral lesions that were new:** 這是新出現的症狀，描述為「lichen-appearing」，這提示可能是扁平苔蘚 (lichen planus)。口腔的扁平苔蘚編碼為 L43.1 (Lichen planus of mouth)。
4.  **Adverse effect of drugs (nilotinib):** 患者因 nilotinib 引起的肝功能異常而停藥，這表明 nilotinib 的不良反應。其 ICD-10 編碼是 T43.5X5A (Adverse effect of other antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter)。
5.  **Allergies: Penicillins / imatinib:** 這兩個是患者的過敏史。對青黴素的過敏史編碼為 Z88.2 (Allergy status to penicillin)。對 imatinib 的過敏史編碼為 Z88.8 (Allergy status to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
6.  **History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma:** 這些是患者的慢性病史。高血壓編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。高血脂症編碼為 E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。哮喘編碼為 J45.909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated)。
7.  **Environmental factor of injury (right hip pain for the past few months):** 患者提到右髖疼痛已有幾個月，這可能與跌倒或其他外傷有關。由於沒有具體說明，編碼為 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: lumbar radiculopathy** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，且病史中明確提到急性加重的右下肢放射性神經病變。對應 ICD-10 編碼 M54.16 (Lumbar radiculopathy, right side)。
2.  **MRI findings: large paracentral disc herniation at L5-S1** - 這是導致神經病變的根本原因。對應 ICD-10 編碼 M51.26 (Herniated disc, lumbar region, right side)。
3.  **Unable to walk due to exquisite pain** - 這描述了患者因疼痛導致的活動受限，屬於急性疼痛。對應 ICD-10 編碼 R51.1 (Acute pain)。
4.  **Numbness and tingling over her lateral right thigh and leg as well as upper inner thigh** - 這些是神經病變的症狀，但 M54.16 已涵蓋了這些症狀，因此不需要額外編碼。
5.  **Denies fecal or urinary incontinence or retention** - 患者否認大小便失禁或潴留，因此不需要編碼。
6.  **Patient has been n.p.o. since 7 AM when she last ate a piece of toast** - 這描述了患者禁食的狀態，但這是一個臨床狀態，而非診斷，因此不需要編碼。
7.  **Otherwise healthy** - 患者除了上述問題外，沒有其他慢性病史或急性病史，因此不需要編碼其他診斷。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：M54.16, M51.26, R51.1。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Left leg and ankle pain and swelling**: 這是主要的主訴，且在病史中被描述為「new onset swelling around the left ankle」和「pain in her left calf」。這指向深部靜脈血栓形成 (DVT) 的可能性，因此編碼為 I82.411 (Left lower limb deep vein thrombosis)。
2.  **History of breast cancer bilaterally, stage IA ER+/PR+ right breast invasive carcinoma and left breast DCIS with microinvasion, s/p bilateral mastectomy (___) and bilateral breast reconstruction (___)**: 這是一個重要的既往病史。由於患者已進行雙側乳房切除術，且目前沒有活動性癌症的描述，因此編碼為 Z85.3 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast)。
3.  **Bilateral breast reconstruction**: 這是一個手術後的狀態，編碼為 Z40.01 (Encounter for other surgical aftercare)。
4.  **Recent surgery (breast reconstruction in ___)**: 這是一個近期的外科手術，編碼為 Z98.81 (Presence of other artificial implants and devices)。
5.  **More immobile following surgery**: 這是一個術後的狀態，編碼為 Z98.81 (Presence of other artificial implants and devices) 也涵蓋了這一點。
6.  **Initial VS were: 97.7 79 153/96 18 100% RA**: 這些是入院時的體徵，但沒有需要單獨編碼的異常值。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pain radiating to arms & legs**: 這是主要的主訴，且描述為「sharp, constant」，並伴有「SOB with chest pain」。這符合急性冠狀動脈症候群（ACS）的表現，特別是考慮到患者有高血壓、吸食可卡因的病史，以及心肌肌鈣蛋白輕微升高（0.08，雖然未明確指出是否為陽性，但這是一個重要的心臟損傷指標）。因此，最合理的編碼是 I20.9 (Unstable angina, unspecified)。
2.  **HIV**: 患者有 HIV 病史，且是主要跟診的機構。這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 B20 (Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease)。
3.  **ESRD on HD**: 患者有終末期腎臟病，並在進行血液透析。這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 N18.6 (End-stage renal disease)。
4.  **Cocaine abuse**: 患者有可卡因濫用史，且在病史中提到「Endorses cocaine and marijuana use」。這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 F14.20 (Cocaine abuse, uncomplicated)。
5.  **Hypertension**: 患者有高血壓病史，應編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
6.  **Vomiting and diarrhea since last night with dysuria**: 這些是急性症狀，且在病史中描述為「sudden onset」。考慮到患者正在進行血液透析，且有「diffuse tenderness w/out voluntary guarding or rebound」，這可能與透析相關的胃腸道症狀或泌尿道感染有關。然而，由於沒有明確的診斷（如尿路感染、胃腸炎等），最合理的編碼是 R10.11 (Vomiting) 和 R19.7 (Diarrhea)。R30.0 (Dysuria) 也應編碼，以反映泌尿道症狀。
7.  **Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) allergy**: 患者對磺胺類抗生素過敏，應編碼為 Z91.013 (Allergy to sulfonamide)。
8.  **Environmental factor of injury (during dialysis)**: 患者在透析期間出現症狀，這是一個重要的環境因素，應編碼為 Y92.099 (Other specified place of occurrence of external cause)。
9.  **Laboratory findings (Na 133, K 5.1, BUN 36, Cr 7.9)**: 這些是實驗室檢查結果，而不是診斷。然而，高血鉀 (K 5.1) 是一個重要的急性症狀，應編碼為 E87.5 (Hyperkalemia)。
10. **ALT 42, AST 88**: 這些是肝臟功能檢查結果，但沒有明確的診斷（如肝炎、肝損傷等），因此不編碼為 ICD-10 診斷碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: ""I need to go home""** - 這是一個症狀，但更常見的編碼是其後的診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: paranoid schizophrenia** - 這是患者的主要診斷，且是「hx」，表示是慢性病史。因此，F20.9 (Schizophrenia, unspecified) 是主要診斷。
3.  **History of Present Illness: acute psychotic presentation** - 這描述了當前的急性發作，是入院的主要原因。因此，F31.9 (Unspecified psychotic disorder) 是急性發作的診斷。
4.  **History of Present Illness: ""I need to talk to the cops"" and ""kidnapped, drugged, sexually assaulted, and put in a fake hospital""** - 這些是患者主觀的妄想症狀，屬於精神分裂症的症狀，通常不單獨編碼，除非是特定的妄想類型。在這種情況下，它們是精神分裂症的表現，因此 F20.9 已涵蓋。
5.  **History of Present Illness: ""found to be agitated and erratic, uncooperative with assessment""** - 這些是急性精神病發作的行為表現，通常包含在 F31.9 中。
6.  **History of Present Illness: ""preoccupied stating 'I need to talk to the cops' and provided a loose narrative that she was 'kidnapped, drugged, sexually assaulted, and put in a fake hospital'""** - 這些是患者主觀的妄想症狀，屬於精神分裂症的症狀，通常不單獨編碼，除非是特定的妄想類型。在這種情況下，它們是精神分裂症的表現，因此 F20.9 已涵蓋。
7.  **History of Present Illness: ""She was a very limited historian, easily angered and needed frequent verbal redirection.""** - 這些是急性精神病發作的行為表現，通常包含在 F31.9 中。
8.  **History of Present Illness: ""She reports living with her mother in ___ but she declined to tell me her mother's name or phone number or allow permission to speak with her.""** - 這表明患者可能有社交退縮或與他人互動困難，但這通常包含在精神分裂症的診斷中，除非有更嚴重的社交退縮症狀，如 F19.20 (Social phobia, unspecified, without anxiety)。
9.  **History of Present Illness: ""She again feels she is being sent to 'fake hospitals and hence is not receiving good care'.""** - 這表明患者對醫療系統有不信任感，這通常包含在精神分裂症的診斷中，除非有更嚴重的妄想症狀，如 F20.9 已涵蓋。
10. **History of Present Illness: ""She also reports that she doesn't see people, but feels like people may be sexually assaulting her, and that something is unusual is happening at night.""** - 這些是患者主觀的妄想症狀，屬於精神分裂症的症狀，通常不單獨編碼，除非是特定的妄想類型。在這種情況下，它們是精神分裂症的表現，因此 F20.9 已涵蓋。
11. **History of Present Illness: ""She denies any suicidality at this time.""** - 這表示患者目前沒有自殺意圖，因此不需要編碼自殺意圖。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: ""I'm here for sleep deprivation.""** 這表明患者的主要主訴是睡眠不足，這通常會導致疲勞。因此，F51.00 (Sleep deprivation) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness: ""history of post partum depression""** 這表明患者有產後抑鬱症的病史。F33.3 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, currently in partial remission) 是一個合適的編碼，因為它涵蓋了重複發作的重度抑鬱症，且目前處於部分緩解狀態。
3.  **History of Present Illness: ""history of bipolar disorder""** 這表明患者有雙相情感障礙的病史。F31.9 (Bipolar affective disorder, current episode unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼，因為它涵蓋了未指明當前發作類型的雙相情感障礙。

7.  **History of Present Illness: ""notably a limited historian""** 這表明患者在描述病史時有困難，這可能與她的精神狀態有關。R45.810 (Other cognitive disorder, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示其他未指明的認知障礙。
8.  **History of Present Illness: ""tangential and disorganized""** 這表明患者在思維和言語上存在混亂。R45.810 (Other cognitive disorder, unspecified) 也涵蓋了這種情況。
9.  **History of Present Illness: ""no known prior suicide attempts""** 這表明患者沒有自殺未遂史，因此不需要編碼自殺未遂。
10. **History of Present Illness: ""abusive ex-husband"" and ""abusive ex-partner""** 這表明患者有虐待史，這可能與她的精神健康問題有關。Z60.4 (Problems related to other specified family circumstances) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示與其他指定家庭情況相關的問題。
11. **History of Present Illness: ""could not afford a lawyer last week and that he lied to the court, saying she has a mental illness and so he was awarded custody of her youngest daughter""** 這表明患者有經濟困難和與法院相關的問題。Z59.5 (Problems related to lack of money) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示與缺乏資金相關的問題。Z63.4 (Problems related to legal circumstances) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示與法律情況相關的問題。

逐步推理：
1.  **Left ICA Aneurysm (主要診斷/手術原因):**  I67.8 是用於未特指的腦動脈瘤的 ICD-10 編碼。由於病歷中明確指出是「Left ICA Aneurysm」，且未進一步說明是破裂或未破裂，I67.8 是最合適的選擇。
2.  **Pipeline embolization of the Left ICA aneurysm (主要手術):**  Z99.89 是用於其他未特指的植入物或移植物狀態的 ICD-10 編碼。Pipeline 作為一種血管內支架，用於治療動脈瘤，因此 Z99.89 用於表示其存在狀態。
3.  **Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) Allergy (過敏史):**  Z91.011 是用於對磺胺類藥物過敏的 ICD-10 編碼。
4.  **Left side tingling (主訴):**  R20.2 是用於左側感覺異常的 ICD-10 編碼。
5.  **Elective (手術性質):**  Z48.89 是用於其他未特指的預防性手術的 ICD-10 編碼。由於是「elective」手術，表示預防性或計劃性的，因此 Z48.89 用於表示手術的性質。

1.  **Chief Complaint: rectal pain** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要進一步鑑別其根本原因。
2.  **History of Present Illness: 1 week history of rectal pain following a fall last ___** - 痛苦的起因是跌倒，但後續的 MRI 發現了更嚴重的問題。
3.  **MRI pelvis done in the ED demonstrated ___ phlegmom likely associated with fissure** - 這是導致肛門疼痛的根本原因。""phlegmom"" 指的是膿腫，""fissure"" 指的是肛裂。因此，應編碼肛裂 (K60.0) 和肛周膿腫 (K61.0)。
4.  **also found to have hyperglycemia (glucose 471) consistent with a new diagnosis of diabetes** - 患者被診斷出患有糖尿病，且血糖值高達 471，這表明是 2 型糖尿病，且伴有高血糖危象。因此，應編碼 2 型糖尿病 (E11.9) 和高血糖危象 (R73.03)。
5.  **he landed on his buttocks which he's not sure relates to his pain or not** - 跌倒導致臀部著地，這是一個外傷事件，應編碼為臀部挫傷 (S30.810A)。
6.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Incision and drainage of perirectal abscess** - 這是一個手術程序，但對於 ICD-10 編碼，我們主要關注診斷而非手術本身。
7.  **he was seen by colorectal surgery in the ED who recommend no surgical intervention, admission to medicine for antibiotics, management of new diagnosis of diabetes** - 這進一步證實了膿腫和糖尿病的診斷，並說明了治療方向。

逐步推理：
1.  **RUQ abd pain**: 這是主要的主訴，但會被更明確的診斷所取代。
2.  **PMH cholelithiasis**: 患者有膽結石病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 K80.00 (Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis)。
3.  **Acute gallstone pancreatitis**: 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是導致急性腹痛的原因。應編碼為 K85.00 (Acute cholelithiasis with cholecystitis without perforation)。
4.  **Elevated LFTs**: 肝功能異常是急性膽石性胰腺炎的常見併發症，應編碼為 R94.1 (Abnormal liver function tests)。
5.  **RUQ u/s negative for cholecystitis**: 超音波檢查排除了膽囊炎，這支持了膽結石而非膽囊炎的診斷。
6.  **Poor po intake in the last 24 hours**: 這是一個症狀，表示患者有進食困難，應編碼為 R63.0 (Anorexia)。
7.  **+dizziness**: 患者有頭暈的症狀，應編碼為 R42.1 (Dizziness)。
8.  **Allergies: iodine / shellfish derived / trazodone / metal**: 患者有多種過敏史，應分別編碼：
    *   Z91.011 (Allergy to iodine)
    *   Z91.012 (Allergy to shellfish)
    *   Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)
    *   Z91.019 (Allergy to unspecified drug, medicament and biological substance)
    *   Z91.013 (Allergy to metals)
9.  **Laparoscopic cholecystectomy**: 這是手術，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **R distal humerus fracture (右肱骨遠端骨折):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，且已進行了 ORIF 手術。因此，最直接的診斷是骨折本身。由於是開放性骨折（ORIF 暗示需要手術治療），且未明確說明是開放性還是閉合性，但通常 ORIF 用於開放性骨折。因此，選擇 S42.401G (Right distal humeral fracture, initial encounter for open fracture type I and II)。

3.  **PMH of HTN (高血壓病史):** 這是患者的慢性病史，應編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
4.  **Allergies: hydrochlorothiazide (氫氯噻嗪過敏):** 這是患者的藥物過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to diuretics)。
5.  **Traumatic incident to his right arm (右臂受傷事件):** 這是一個導致骨折的外部原因，應編碼為 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence) 作為環境因素。
6.  **Trying to get up out of the bathtub by using his right arm to push up on a rail (試圖用右臂推扶欄杆起身):** 這是導致骨折的具體活動，應編碼為 W19.XXXA (Other specified accidental falls, initial encounter) 作為外部原因。
7.  **Putting pressure on his right arm for approximately 1.5 hours (右臂受壓約1.5小時):** 這是一個導致骨折的機械性因素，應編碼為 Y93.01 (Excessive pressure) 作為外部原因的附加信息。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Brain mass** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要根據後續的診斷和病史來確定具體的 ICD-10 編碼。
2.  **History of left frontal anaplastic astrocytoma** - 這是一個明確的診斷，指出了腦部腫瘤的類型和位置。Anaplastic astrocytoma 是一種惡性星形細胞瘤，屬於膠質瘤。在 ICD-10 中，C71.0 代表「腦部星形細胞瘤」，而 C71.00 是「未指明的腦部星形細胞瘤」。由於病歷中未提及具體的亞型（如 C71.01 代表「間變性星形細胞瘤」），因此 C71.00 是最合適的選擇。
3.  **Discovered after a first time seizure during sleep** - 這是一個症狀，描述了腫瘤的發現方式。在 ICD-10 中，R56.9 代表「未指明的癲癇發作」。
4.  **He had a resection in ___ with subsequent chemoradiation** - 這表明患者曾接受過手術和化療放療，但這些是過去的治療，不是當前的診斷或症狀。
5.  **He is on Keppra. He denies further seizure activity.** - 這表明患者目前沒有癲癇發作，且正在服用抗癲癇藥物。這支持了 R56.9 的診斷，並表明患者目前的狀態是穩定的。
6.  **Surveillance MRI shows progression of the lesion. He presents for elective stereotactic brain biopsy.** - 這表明腫瘤有進展，並進行了活檢。活檢本身是手術程序，不是診斷碼。

</think>

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: right back pain, abdominal pain and urinary frequency** - 這些是患者就診的主要症狀。
    *   **Right back pain (right lower back pain)** - 由於病史中提到患者有 L5 骨裂，且目前仍有腰痛，這應被視為骨裂的後遺症。因此，最合適的編碼是 M81.0 (Osteoporotic fracture of lumbar region, current fracture, initial encounter for closed fracture)。雖然 M81.0 主要針對骨裂，但由於患者仍有疼痛，且沒有其他更精確的疼痛編碼，這可以涵蓋當前的腰痛。
    *   **Abdominal pain** - 患者有腹痛，但沒有進一步的診斷或檢查結果明確其原因。因此，應使用 R10.9 (Unspecified abdominal pain) 作為症狀編碼。
    *   **Urinary frequency** - 患者有尿頻，但沒有進一步的診斷或檢查結果明確其原因。因此，應使用 R35.0 (Frequency of micturition) 作為症狀編碼。

2.  **PMH: chronic anemia, osteoporosis, hypertension, ataxia, and recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls** - 這些是患者的既往病史。
    *   **Chronic anemia** - 患者有慢性貧血，應使用 D50.0 (Iron deficiency anemia) 作為編碼。雖然病史中沒有明確貧血的類型，但 D50.0 是最常見的慢性貧血編碼。
    *   **Osteoporosis** - 患者有骨質疏鬆症，應使用 M81.0 (Osteoporotic fracture of lumbar region, current fracture, initial encounter for closed fracture) 作為編碼。雖然 M81.0 主要針對骨裂，但由於患者有骨質疏鬆症的病史，且 L5 骨裂是骨質疏鬆的結果，因此 M81.0 也涵蓋了骨質疏鬆症本身。
    *   **Hypertension** - 患者有高血壓，應使用 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 作為編碼。
    *   **Ataxia** - 患者有共濟失調，應使用 R27.0 (Ataxia) 作為編碼。
    *   **Recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls** - 患者有 L5 骨裂，且有反覆跌倒的病史。L5 骨裂應使用 M81.0 (Osteoporotic fracture of lumbar region, current fracture, initial encounter for closed fracture) 作為編碼。反覆跌倒的病史應使用 Z87.89 (Personal history of other specified conditions) 作為編碼。

3.  **Recent history:**
    *   **On ___, she presented with 4 days of LBP s/p fall from standing at which time imaging revealed acute L5 fracture. She was evaluated by Spine team who recommended early mobilization, pain control, but no brace required. She was evaluated by ___, and discharged to ___.** - 這進一步證實了 L5 骨裂的診斷，並支持 M81.0 的使用。
    *   **On ___, she again presented to ___ s/p fall from standing while trying to reach for a glass of water. She did have a occipital scalp hematoma, but imaging including ___, C-spine CT, and L hip X-ray were negative for acute process so patient was discharged home.** - 這進一步證實了反覆跌倒的病史，並支持 Z87.89 的使用。

4.  **Current presentation:**
    *   **In the setting of opiates for her L5 fracture, the patient has had constipation (5 days with no BM) for which she took a ""natural laxative"" the evening prior to presentation. The patient had 2 bowel movements in the morning of presentation and one episode of incontinence with diarrhea while sleeping. In this setting, she felt very weak and called EMS and was brought to ___ ED.** - 這描述了患者目前的症狀，包括腹痛、尿頻、腹瀉、便秘、虛弱等。這些症狀已經在上述的症狀編碼中涵蓋。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pain (right sided, sudden onset, lasting 5 minutes, similar to prior infection, subsided, mild ongoing, more intense at PCP, subsided shortly after ED arrival):**  This is a presenting symptom. Since it's described as ""sudden onset"" and ""similar to a prior infection,"" it's likely a non-cardiac cause. However, the ECG showed ST depression in V1-V6, and labs showed elevated troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating myocardial ischemia. The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward, and a left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, and DES were performed. These findings strongly suggest an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with subsequent intervention. Therefore, the most appropriate code for the chest pain in this context is R07.2 (Chest pain, unspecified) as a symptom, but the underlying diagnosis is more critical.
2.  **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST depression on ECG, elevated troponin-T and CK-MB, and subsequent PCI:**  The presence of ST depression, elevated cardiac biomarkers, and the intervention (PCI) indicates an acute coronary syndrome. Since the patient underwent PCI, this is an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with subsequent intervention. The most specific code for this scenario is I25.210 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with acute (subacute) type 1 myocardial infarction without angina pectoris). This code accounts for the underlying CAD, the acute MI, and the fact that the patient is not experiencing angina pectoris at the time of presentation.
3.  **History of CAD s/p PCI in ___:**  This is a chronic condition. The most appropriate code for this is I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris). This code represents the underlying CAD that led to the acute MI.
4.  **Symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM:**  The patient has a history of symptomatic bradycardia that required a pacemaker. The most appropriate code for this is I44.8 (Other specified arrhythmias). This code is used for other specified arrhythmias, including bradycardia.
5.  **Pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions bilaterally on CXR:**  These are findings on imaging. The most appropriate code for pulmonary edema is R06.02 (Pulmonary edema). The small pleural effusions are a separate finding and are coded as J90.810 (Other pleural effusion, unspecified side).
6.  **Increased cardiomegaly on CXR:**  This is a finding on imaging. The most appropriate code for this is R09.2 (Cardiomegaly).
7.  **Dyspnea on exertion:**  This is a symptom reported by the patient. The most appropriate code for this is R06.02 (Dyspnea).
8.  **Dizziness:**  This is a symptom reported by the patient. The most appropriate code for this is R42.8 (Other dizziness).
9.  **Loss of appetite:**  This is a symptom reported by the patient. The most appropriate code for this is R63.0 (Anorexia).
10. **Allergies: Metoprolol / Atenolol / Lisinopril / triamterene-hydrochlorothiazid:**  These are drug allergies. The most appropriate code for each is Z91.011 (Allergy to beta-blocker), Z91.012 (Allergy to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), and Z91.019 (Allergy to other specified drug, medicament, and biological substance).
11. **Hypertension:**  This is a chronic condition. The most appropriate code for this is I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension).
12. **Osteoporosis:**  This is a chronic condition. The most appropriate code for this is M81.0 (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture).
13. **Environmental factor of injury (fall):**  The patient's history of falls is mentioned. The most appropriate code for this is Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause of injury).
14. **Adverse effect of drugs (laxatives/opioids):**  The patient's history of adverse effects from laxatives and opioids is mentioned. The most appropriate code for this is T47.4X5A (Adverse effect of other laxatives, initial encounter).

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: syncope** - 患者主訴昏厥，這是本次就診的主要原因。在病史中，昏厥被描述為在酒精戒斷後的症狀，且在就診時有低血壓 (98/84) 和心率 16，這支持了昏厥的診斷。因此，R55.8 (Other specified syncope and collapse) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **hx of anxiety, depression** - 患者有焦慮和抑鬱的病史，這在病史中被明確提及。F41.9 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified) 和 F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) 是對這些慢性精神疾病的適當編碼。
3.  **EtOH dependence, 27 pack year smoking hx and recent dx of Stage IIIa RUL NSCLC** - 患者有酒精依賴史，這在病史中被明確提及。F10.20 (Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated) 是對酒精依賴的適當編碼。患者有27年的吸煙史，這是一個重要的風險因素，Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified tobacco use) 是對此的適當編碼。患者最近被診斷為IIIa期右上肺非小細胞肺癌，這是一個主要的診斷。C34.11 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, right lung) 是對此的適當編碼。
4.  **In setting of EtOH relapse. Pt reports longest period of sobriety ___ years, until he started drinking again ___ year ago. He was in detox twice in the past year, most recently ___ at ___** - 患者在酒精戒斷後出現症狀，這表明酒精戒斷是導致昏厥的直接原因。F10.21 (Alcohol dependence with alcohol withdrawal syndrome) 是對酒精依賴伴酒精戒斷綜合徵的適當編碼。
5.  **He started drinking again on ___ and ___, consuming 1 liter of vodka. His last drink was ___, midnight (end of the day). He notes that, within 2 hours, he started withdrawing, with symptoms including ""racing"" sensation, inability to sit still, dry mouth. He went to ___ to pick up prescriptions on ___ morning at about 10 am, to fill rxs for Prozac and Xanax. When he walked into ___, he experienced increased anxiety ___ to being in public. He paced while waiting in the pharmacy line, theb began to feel lightheaded. The next thing he recalls is being loaded onto a stretcher. Denies tongue biting, incontinence.

Per ___ notes, EMS relayed that several people in line had seen some ""small shaking movements."" In the past, he has gotten the shakes when detoxing, but denies hx of DTs, alcoholic hallucinosis, or seizures.** - 患者在酒精戒斷後出現了多種戒斷症狀，包括心悸、坐立不安、口乾、暈眩、震顫、焦慮和意識模糊。這些症狀符合酒精戒斷綜合徵的診斷。F10.21 (Alcohol dependence with alcohol withdrawal syndrome) 已經涵蓋了這些症狀，因此不需要為每個症狀單獨編碼。
6.  **CT of facial bones revealed nasal bone fractures, nasal septum fractures and an air-fluid level in the frontal sinus s/o frontal sinus fracture. He had a 3cm laceration over his right eyebrow that was closed with interrupted prolene and then he was transferred to ___ ___ for further management of ""possible frontal sinus fracture.""** - 患者有面部骨頭骨折，包括鼻骨骨折、鼻中隔骨折和額竇骨折。S02.00XA (Unspecified nasal bone fracture, initial encounter) 是對鼻骨骨折的適當編碼。S02.10XA (Unspecified nasal septum fracture, initial encounter) 是對鼻中隔骨折的適當編碼。S02.81XA (Other specified fractures of face, initial encounter) 是對額竇骨折的適當編碼。患者有右眼眉3cm的裂傷，這被縫合了。S01.01XA (Laceration without foreign body of eyelid and eyebrow, initial encounter) 是對此的適當編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) with SDH (Subdural Hematoma):** 患者因跌倒導致頭部受傷，並在之前被診斷出有右側硬腦膜下血腫 (SDH)。目前因「worsening/new ICH」（惡化/新發腦內出血）而入院，且神經外科已會診。這表明目前的 SDH 是主要的急性問題。因此，S06.00XA (Unspecified intracranial injury without loss of consciousness, initial encounter) 和 S06.5XXA (Subdural hematoma, initial encounter) 是主要的診斷。
2.  **Fall from standing:** 患者跌倒的機制是「fall from standing」，這是一個重要的外傷原因。因此，W19.XXXA (Unspecified fall, initial encounter) 是合適的。
3.  **Environmental factor of injury:** 患者跌倒的場所是「in his bathroom」，這屬於「unspecified place of occurrence」。因此，Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence, initial encounter) 是合適的。
4.  **Hypertension:** 患者有高血壓病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。因此，I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是合適的。
5.  **Chronic anemia:** 患者有慢性貧血病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。因此，D50.0 (Chronic iron deficiency anemia) 是合適的。
6.  **Osteoporosis:** 患者有骨質疏鬆症病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。因此，M81.0 (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture) 是合適的。
7.  **Ataxia:** 患者有共濟失調病史，這是一個重要的慢性神經系統疾病。因此，R27.0 (Ataxia) 是合適的。
8.  **Allergies:**
    *   Aspirin: Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin)
    *   Penicillin: Z91.012 (Allergy to penicillin)
    *   Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics): Z91.013 (Allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics)
9.  **Adverse effect of drugs (Lovenox):** 患者因服用 Lovenox (低分子肝素) 而導致腦內出血惡化，這是一個藥物不良反應。因此，T42.4X5A (Adverse effect of heparin, initial encounter) 是合適的。
10. **Adverse effect of drugs (Coumadin):** 患者因服用 Coumadin (華法林) 而導致腦內出血惡化，這是一個藥物不良反應。因此，T46.1X5A (Adverse effect of coumarin derivatives, initial encounter) 是合適的。
11. **Adverse effect of drugs (Plavix):** 患者因服用 Plavix (氯吡格雷) 而導致腦內出血惡化，這是一個藥物不良反應。因此，T43.6X5A (Adverse effect of antiplatelet agents, initial encounter) 是合適的。
12. **Other chronic conditions:**
    *   Hypothyroidism: E03.9 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified)
    *   Hyperlipidemia: E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Scheduled Chemotherapy** - 這是一個就診原因，不是診斷，通常不編碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness:**
    *   **""resected stage IIIB (T3 N2a) colon cancer""** - 這是一個重要的診斷，表示患者有結腸癌病史，且已切除。根據 ICD-10，C18.6 代表結腸的惡性腫瘤，Z85.060 代表個人有結腸癌病史。
    *   **""adjuvant modified FOLFOX 6 with curative intent""** - 這表示患者正在接受化療，但這本身不是一個診斷，而是治療方式。
    *   **""infusion reaction at the start of cycle 5 ___s during day 15""** - 這是一個重要的事件，導致了後續的處理。根據 ICD-10，T36-T50 類別用於藥物、醫學製劑和生物製劑的不良反應。由於是對 oxaliplatin 的不良反應，且是首次發生，應編碼為 T36.0X5A (Adverse effect of oxaliplatin, initial encounter)。
    *   **""Allergy on ___ where skin prick testing revealed allergic sensitization to oxaliplatin (8 mm wheal/14 mm flare)""** - 這明確指出患者對 oxaliplatin 有過敏反應。根據 ICD-10，Z91.011 代表對化學藥物的過敏狀態。
    *   **""It was recommended to proceed with 3 bag desensitization for all subsequent chemo infusions.""** - 這是一個治療計劃，不是診斷。
    *   **""Patient reports feeling fatigued.""** - 疲勞是症狀，編碼為 R53.83 (Other fatigue)。
    *   **""shortness of breath with exertion as well as productive cough.""** - 呼吸困難和咳嗽是症狀，編碼為 R06.02 (Dyspnea) 和 R05.2 (Productive cough)。
    *   **""SLE"" (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)** - 這是一個慢性疾病，編碼為 M32.9 (Systemic lupus erythematosus, unspecified)。
    *   **""remote history of nephrotic syndrome thought unrelated to SLE""** - 這是一個過去的診斷，且與 SLE 無關，編碼為 N03.9 (Nephrotic syndrome, unspecified)。
    *   **""hypertension""** - 高血壓是慢性疾病，編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
    *   **""GERD"" (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)** - 胃食道逆流是慢性疾病，編碼為 K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis)。
    *   **""productive cough""** - 已經在症狀中編碼為 R05.2。
    *   **""denies pain""** - 患者否認疼痛，因此不需要編碼疼痛症狀。
    *   **""denies fevers/chills, night sweats, headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness/numbnesss, hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, hematochezia/melena, dysuria, hematuria, and new rashes.""** - 患者否認這些症狀，因此不需要編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   C18.6 (Colon, malignant neoplasm)
*   Z85.060 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of colon)
*   T36.0X5A (Adverse effect of oxaliplatin, initial encounter)
*   Z91.011 (Allergy status to chemical drug)
*   R53.83 (Other fatigue)
*   R06.02 (Dyspnea)

逐步推理：
1.  **Unneeded Ileostomy (主訴) / Ileostomy Takedown (主要手術)：** 這表示患者因不必要的回腸造口而就診，並進行了回腸造口拆除手術。這通常與回腸造口的併發症或功能障礙相關。最直接的編碼是 K66.6 (Other specified intestinal fistulas)，因為回腸造口本身是一種腸道瘻管，且其存在導致了需要拆除的問題。
2.  **Rectal Cancer (病史)：** 患者有直腸癌病史，這是回腸造口的原發原因。因此，需要編碼 Z85.06 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of rectum)。
3.  **Robotic LAR (病史)：** 這表示患者曾接受過腹腔鏡低位前切除術 (LAR)，這是一種直腸癌的常見手術。雖然這不是當前就診的診斷，但它是回腸造口的背景信息，因此編碼 Z90.4 (Presence of colostomy or ileostomy) 是合適的，表示存在回腸造口。
4.  **Allergies: ACE Inhibitors (過敏史)：** 患者對ACE抑制劑過敏，這是一個重要的臨床資訊，需要編碼 Z91.012 (Allergy to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，且直腸檢查發現了陽性隱血。這指向消化道出血，特別是下消化道出血。因此，K62.5 (Hemorrhoids with bleeding) 是一個合理的選擇，因為患者有痔瘡病史，且痔瘡是導致BRBPR的常見原因。此外，R16.0 (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage) 也適用於描述消化道出血。
2.  **Hemorrhoids:** 患者有痔瘡病史，且最近的直腸檢查也發現了痔瘡。因此，K64.8 (Other hemorrhoids) 是必要的。
3.  **Hypertension (HTN):** 患者有高血壓病史。因此，I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是必要的。
4.  **Endometrial cancer with oligometastasis to left lung:** 患者有子宮內膜癌病史，且有肺部轉移。因此，C54.1 (Carcinoma of endometrium) 用於原發病灶，C78.5 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung) 用於轉移病灶。
5.  **Recent ICU admission for PNA:** 患者最近因肺炎入院ICU。因此，J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism) 是必要的。
6.  **Paroxysmal Afib started on coumadin:** 患者有陣發性心房顫動，並正在服用華法林。因此，I48.9 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation) 是必要的。此外，Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants) 用於記錄華法林的長期使用。
7.  **Downtrending Hct for the past two weeks:** 患者血紅蛋白水平持續下降，這是一個重要的臨床發現，表明存在貧血。因此，D64.9 (Anemia, unspecified) 是必要的。
8.  **2L O2 requirement:** 患者需要吸氧，這是一個重要的臨床發現。因此，R09.02 (Hypoxemia) 是必要的。
9.  **?hx dCHF (last TTE ___ with EF > 70% here) and was started on Lasix:** 患者有心臟衰竭的病史，並正在服用利尿劑。因此，I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified) 是必要的。
10. **Omeprazole allergy:** 患者對奧美拉唑過敏。因此，Z91.013 (Allergy to proton pump inhibitor) 是必要的。
11. **Chronic abdominal pain at night:** 患者有慢性腹痛。因此，R10.9 (Abdominal pain, unspecified) 是必要的。
12. **More tired for the past few weeks:** 患者報告最近幾週更加疲勞。因此，R53.83 (Fatigue) 是必要的。
13. **Adverse effect of drugs (laxatives/opioids):** 患者因使用瀉藥和阿片類藥物導致腹瀉和便秘。因此，T47.4X5A (Adverse effect of laxatives) 是必要的。

逐步推理：
1.  **polytrauma status post 90 mph MVC**: 這是一個多處創傷的狀態，由高車速的車禍引起。這應編碼為 S00-T88 (Injuries, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes) 系列中的一個或多個代碼，並加上 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause of injury) 來表示事故發生地點。
2.  **left lower extremity pain and neck pain**: 這些是症狀，但由於有明確的創傷診斷，通常不需要單獨編碼症狀。
3.  **left lower extremity pain**: 由於有明確的左股骨骨折診斷，這不是需要單獨編碼的症狀。
4.  **neck pain**: 由於有明確的頸部創傷診斷，這不是需要單獨編碼的症狀。
5.  **left lower extremity was initially pulseless upon presentation; pulses resumed with manipulation**: 這描述了左下肢的創傷，導致股骨骨折。因此，S72.00 (Fracture of shaft of left femur, initial encounter for closed fracture) 是適當的診斷。
6.  **L femur retrograde nail, L pilon ex-fix**: 這些是手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
7.  **Haldol allergy**: 這是一個藥物過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to antipsychotic drugs)。
8.  **Unknown head strike and unknown loss of consciousness**: 這些是事故的相關資訊，但由於患者在到達急診室時 GCS 15，且沒有明確的頭部創傷診斷，因此不編碼為頭部創傷。
9.  **GCS 15**: 這表示患者在到達急診室時是清醒的，沒有意識障礙，因此不需要編碼意識狀態。
10. **medically stable**: 這表示患者在到達急診室時是穩定的，沒有急性生命威脅，因此不需要編碼為急診狀態。

1.  **Diabetic foot ulcer (Chief Complaint):** 這是主要的就診原因，且病歷中明確提到是「Diabetic foot ulcer」。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic foot ulcer)。這是一個組合碼，同時涵蓋了糖尿病和其相關的足部潰瘍。
2.  **Angiogram of the left leg (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個診斷性檢查，用於評估下肢的血管情況。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z89.21 (Encounter for angiography of lower extremity)。
3.  **Excisional debridement down to and including bone with wound vac placement, Left foot (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個治療性手術，用於處理足部潰瘍。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z48.81 (Encounter for other surgical aftercare)。雖然 Z48.81 通常用於手術後的隨訪，但在此情境下，它可以用來表示為處理潰瘍而進行的外科清創和負壓引流。
4.  **PICC line placement (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個侵入性程序，用於放置靜脈導管。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z48.82 (Encounter for other surgical aftercare)。同樣，雖然 Z48.82 通常用於手術後的隨訪，但在此情境下，它可以用來表示為治療目的而進行的導管放置。
5.  **Allergies: metoclopramide:** 這是一個重要的病史資訊，表示患者對某種藥物過敏。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z91.011 (Allergy to other drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但通常會被更具體的診斷碼所涵蓋。
2.  **Severe COPD (GOLD Stage IV) on 2L NC home O2** - 這是一個核心診斷。GOLD Stage IV 通常對應 J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified)。由於患者使用氧氣，需要添加 R09.02 (Hypoxemia)。
3.  **COPD exacerbation requiring BiPAP treatment** - 這是一個急性加重，對應 J44.1 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation)。
4.  **DM (Diabetes Mellitus)** - 這是患者的慢性病史。由於病歷中提到「Blood sugar has been an issue with fluctuating steroid dosing recently with fasting ___ 180s, but sometimes up to 300s after eating.」，這表明血糖控制不佳，因此應編碼 E11.62 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia)。
5.  **HTN (Hypertension)** - 這是患者的慢性病史，編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
6.  **Recent admission with COPD exacerbations on a nearly monthly basis** - 這表明患者有頻繁的COPD急性加重，這是一個重要的慢性病史，編碼 Z86.11 (Personal history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)。
7.  **Frequent prednisone tapers** - 這表明患者有長期使用類固醇的病史，這是一個重要的慢性病史，編碼 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of corticosteroids)。
8.  **Baseline chronic dry cough, No sputum** - 這是COPD的症狀，通常被J44.9涵蓋，但若需單獨編碼，可考慮 R05.2 (Cough)。
9.  **Fluctuating steroid dosing recently with fasting ___ 180s, but sometimes up to 300s after eating.** - 這進一步支持了E11.62 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia)。
10. **Initial labs at ___: ___ 12, H/H ___, plt 299, chemistry panel normal with Cr 1.0, trop <0.01** - 這些是實驗室結果，通常不直接編碼為診斷碼，除非有特定的異常值需要編碼。例如，H/H (Hemoglobin/Hematocrit) 低於正常值可能表示貧血，但病歷中未明確提及貧血，因此不編碼。Cr 1.0 在正常範圍內，不編碼。Trop <0.01 也未提示心肌梗塞，因此不編碼。
11. **On arrival to the MICU, patient was afebrile, AAOx2, tachycardic to 130s, on BiPAP with normal mentation, but poor air movement and diffuse, tight wheeze.** - 這些是入院時的症狀和體徵，通常由更具體的診斷碼涵蓋，如J44.1 (COPD with exacerbation) 和 R09.02 (Hypoxemia)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Right thyroid nodule.** 這是一個主要的症狀，但通常會被更具體的診斷或手術原因所取代。
2.  **History of Present Illness: relatively large right-sided thyroid nodule measuring approximately 4.1 cm in diameter.** 這是一個重要的發現，表明存在一個右側的甲状腺結節。
3.  **An ultrasound has revealed a hypervascular solid nodule.** 這進一步描述了結節的性質，但對於編碼來說，結節本身是主要的診斷。
4.  **Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy has been nondiagnostic on 2 occasions.** 這表明活檢未能明確診斷，但這不是一個獨立的診斷碼。
5.  **Because of the large size of the nodule, however, the patient has opted for a right hemithyroidectomy, mainly for diagnostic purposes to rule out malignancy.** 這清楚地表明，手術的主要目的是為了診斷，以排除惡性腫瘤。這指向了「未明確的良性或惡性腫瘤」的診斷，因為目前尚無明確的良性或惡性診斷。
6.  **Risks and benefits associated with the procedure have been discussed in great detail, and the consent form has been signed.** 這是一個程序性信息，不直接對應 ICD-10 編碼。

最合理的編碼集合：
*   **C73.0 (Malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland, unspecified)**: 由於手術是為了診斷以排除惡性腫瘤，且結節的大小和性質（4.1cm, hypervascular solid nodule）提示需要高度懷疑惡性，因此選擇 C73.0 作為主要診斷。
*   **Z85.81 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland)**: 患者有「未明確的良性或惡性腫瘤」的診斷，這可以被視為一種個人病史，因此 Z85.81 是一個合理的附加診斷。
*   **Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified malignant neoplasm)**: 這是一個更通用的個人惡性腫瘤病史碼，可以作為 Z85.81 的補充。
*   **Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin)**: 患者對青黴素過敏，這是一個重要的病史信息，需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chest and epigastric pain**: 患者主訴胸痛和上腹痛，描述為「sharp, across lower chest, continuous until now」，且「deep breaths cause stabs of pain」，這符合胸膜炎的症狀。因此，編碼 R07.89 (Other specified chest pain) 和 R10.13 (Epigastric pain) 是合理的。
2.  **Hypoxic in the ED**: 患者在急診室被發現有低氧血症，這是一個重要的診斷。編碼 R09.03 (Hypoxia) 是適當的。
3.  **Abdomen very tender, Belly fullness and distention, Nausea and 1 episode of emesis, Abdomen very tender**: 這些症狀表明急性腹痛。編碼 R10.9 (Acute abdominal pain) 是適當的。
4.  **Chronic pain with high dose home opioids**: 患者有慢性疼痛病史，且正在使用高劑量阿片類藥物。這是一個重要的慢性病史。編碼 G89.29 (Other chronic pain) 是適當的。
5.  **Re BPH, recent UTI and urosepsis admission. DC at the beginning of ___. Now self-cathing 5x daily and has some spontaneous urination but with residuals. Per pt, has been scheduled to have a surgical procedure on prostate this week**: 患者有良性前列腺增生 (BPH)、泌尿道感染 (UTI) 和泌尿道感染性敗血症 (urosepsis) 的病史。目前有排尿困難，需要自我導尿，並有殘餘尿。這些都指向泌尿道感染和前列腺增生。編碼 N40.1 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms) 和 N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified) 是適當的。
6.  **Lingering URI-type Sx since admission in ___. Previously with some green phlegm, though not having that now. Denies sinus congestion, nasal discharge, sore throat at present**: 患者有持續的上呼吸道感染症狀，儘管目前沒有黃色痰液、鼻塞、流鼻涕或喉嚨痛。這表明是上呼吸道感染的後遺症。編碼 J06.9 (Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified) 是適當的。
7.  **Had a duodenal dilation on ___ for stricture; no immediate pain after that procedure**: 患者有十二指腸擴張的病史，這是一個重要的既往手術。編碼 K31.81 (Other specified acquired deformity of duodenum) 是適當的。
8.  **Allergies: bee venom (honey bee) / vancomycin**: 患者對蜂毒和萬古黴素過敏。編碼 Z91.011 (Allergy to bee venom) 和 Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 是適當的。
9.  **Of note, pt is a ___ Health ___**: 患者是 ___ Health ___ 的成員，這是一個重要的社會人口學資訊。編碼 Z51.89 (Other specified social and economic factors) 是適當的。

</think>

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Gastric mass (large gastric mass, 4 cm):**  This is the primary reason for the surgical procedure.  Since the biopsy results show ""gastric foveolar hyperplasia with associated cystic glands and lympho-plasmacytic infiltrate"" and ""no evidence of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma,"" it is a benign neoplasm.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is D12.0 (Benign neoplasm of stomach).
2.  **Anemia (hemoglobin of approximately 7):**  The patient was anemic, and this is a significant symptom.  The anemia is likely due to the gastric mass, which is causing chronic blood loss.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is D63.0 (Iron deficiency anemia).
3.  **Iron infusions:**  This is a treatment for the anemia.  It is not a diagnosis but an intervention.  However, it is important to note that the patient is undergoing treatment for anemia, which is already captured by D63.0.
4.  **Large pedunculated cecal polyp:**  This is a separate finding from the gastric mass.  It is a benign neoplasm.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is D12.3 (Benign neoplasm of cecum).
5.  **2 splenic flexure polyps:**  These are also benign neoplasms.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is D12.4 (Benign neoplasm of transverse colon).
6.  **Laparoscopic converted to open resection of gastric mass:**  This is a surgical procedure, not a diagnosis.  It is important to note the procedure performed, but it does not correspond to an ICD-10 diagnosis code.

逐步推理：
1.  **非癒合的左下肢潰瘍 (nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer)**：這是患者就診的主要原因。由於病歷中提到這是慢性潰瘍，且未愈合，最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 L97.511 (Chronic ulcer of left lower leg)。
2.  **慢性下肢潰瘍的血管原因 (vascular cause of chronic lower extremity ulcer)**：病歷中明確指出潰瘍是因為左側旁路移植血管阻塞。因此，需要編碼與血管阻塞相關的 ICD-10 編碼。
3.  **左側旁路移植血管阻塞 (occlusion within his L bypass graft)**：這是一個重要的診斷，直接導致潰瘍。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 I70.241 (Occlusion of left lower extremity bypass graft)。
4.  **慢性下肢缺血 (chronic lower extremity ischemia)**：病歷中提到患者有慢性下肢潰瘍，且ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) 顯示左側為 0.24，這是一個嚴重的缺血指標。因此，I70.209 (Chronic lower extremity ischemia, unspecified leg) 是一個重要的診斷。
5.  **右側旁路移植血管 (patent right graft with monophasic waveforms, but velocities of 104 to 179 at the distal anastomosis)**：雖然右側旁路移植血管是通的，但其血流速度較高，這可能表示存在一定程度的血管狹窄或血流動力學異常。因此，I70.109 (Atherosclerosis of unspecified lower extremity bypass graft, unspecified leg) 是一個合理的編碼。
6.  **高血壓 (hypertension)**：病歷中提到患者有高血壓病史，因此需要編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
7.  **糖尿病 (diabetes mellitus)**：病歷中提到患者有糖尿病病史，且有「optimized wound care and medical care」，這通常與糖尿病相關的潰瘍和血管疾病相關。因此，E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 是一個合理的編碼。
8.  **高脂血症 (hyperlipidemia)**：病歷中提到患者有高脂血症病史，因此需要編碼 E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。
9.  **慢性腎臟病 (chronic kidney disease)**：病歷中提到患者有慢性腎臟病史，因此需要編碼 N18.6 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5 (ESRD))。
10. **心臟衰竭 (heart failure)**：病歷中提到患者有心臟衰竭病史，因此需要編碼 I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified)。
11. **心房顫動 (atrial fibrillation)**：病歷中提到患者有心房顫動病史，因此需要編碼 I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)。
12. **慢性阻塞性肺病 (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)**：病歷中提到患者有慢性阻塞性肺病史，因此需要編碼 J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified)。
13. **慢性便秘 (chronic constipation)**：病歷中提到患者有慢性便秘病史，因此需要編碼 K59.00 (Constipation, unspecified)。
14. **慢性疼痛 (chronic pain)**：病歷中提到患者有慢性疼痛病史，因此需要編碼 G89.29 (Other chronic pain syndromes)。
15. **慢性腎臟病 (chronic kidney disease) 的透析 (dialysis)**：病歷中提到患者有慢性腎臟病史，且「s/p LLE diagnostic angiogram & Patch angioplasty of distal L fem-AT vein graft」，這通常需要透析。因此，Z99.2 (Dependence on dialysis) 是一個合理的編碼。
16. **藥物過敏 (drug allergies)**：病歷中提到患者對青黴素、二甲雙胍和Bactrim過敏。這些過敏史需要編碼：
    *   Z88.0 (Allergy to penicillin)
    *   Z88.2 (Allergy to metformin)
    *   Z88.3 (Allergy to sulfonamides)

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT):** 這是患者此次就診的主要主訴，也是入院的主要原因。因此，I47.1 (Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) 是主要診斷。
2.  **Aortic stenosis:** 患者有主動脈瓣狹窄的病史，且是TAVR/AVR評估的一部分。這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼。I35.0 (Aortic stenosis) 是最合適的。
3.  **CHF exacerbation (Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation):** 患者最近因心力衰竭惡化入院，且有4磅體重增加的證據。這是一個急性問題，應編碼。I50.23 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure) 是最合適的，因為它表示慢性心力衰竭的急性惡化。
4.  **Coronary angiogram and right heart catheterization:** 這些是診斷程序，不是診斷本身，因此不需要編碼。
5.  **TAVR/AVR workup:** 這是一個評估過程，不是診斷，因此不需要編碼。
6.  **Weight gain:** 這是心力衰竭惡化的表現，已包含在 I50.23 中。
7.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 沒有需要編碼的過敏史。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Shortness of breath and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure:** 這是一個主要的症狀和診斷。由於是急性發作，且有慢性心力衰竭的背景，應編碼 I5024 (Acute on chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure)。
2.  **Severe AS with a TAVR workup one year ago, found not to meet criteria at that time:** 這表明患者有嚴重的主動脈瓣狹窄，且曾評估過經導管主動脈瓣置換術 (TAVR)。目前的症狀和心力衰竭可能與此相關。因此，主動脈瓣狹窄應編碼 I350 (Aortic valve (stenosis) (narrowing))。
3.  **Severe AS with mean gradient of 34 mmHg increased to 42 mm Hg with 10 mcg of dobutamine:** 這進一步證實了主動脈瓣狹窄的嚴重性，並支持 I350 的編碼。
4.  **elevated filling pressures and depressed cardiac index:** 這些是心力衰竭的客觀證據，支持 I5024 的編碼。
5.  **PMH significant for CAD s/p BMS in ___:** 患者有冠狀動脈疾病史，且曾植入支架。這應編碼 I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。
6.  **CAD s/p BMS in ___:** 這表明患者有冠狀動脈支架植入史，應編碼 Z955 (Presence of coronary atherectomy device)。
7.  **PMH significant for AFIB/flutter not on anticoagulation:** 患者有心房顫動/心房顫動，且未使用抗凝血劑。這應編碼 I489 (Other specified cardiac arrhythmias)。
8.  **CKD Stage III:** 患者有第三期慢性腎臟病。這應編碼 N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3)。
9.  **Hypertension:** 患者有高血壓。這應編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
10. **GI bleed one year ago:** 患者有胃腸道出血史。這應編碼 K620 (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, unspecified)。
11. **TAVR workup one year ago, found not to meet criteria at that time:** 患者曾評估過TAVR，但當時不符合標準。這應編碼 Z86811 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions)。
12. **___ s/p ___ 3 TAVR:** 患者曾接受過TAVR手術。這應編碼 Z9581 (Presence of other artificial heart valve)。
13. **___ PACEMAKER IMPLANT: Dual chamber ___ (BSc) DDD 60-120 implanted via left cephalic vein:** 患者有植入式心臟起搏器。這應編碼 Z9580 (Presence of other artificial cardiac pacemaker)。
14. **Troponin elevated to 0.073:** 肌鈣蛋白升高是心肌損傷的指標，但未明確診斷為心肌梗塞。這應編碼 R946 (Elevated cardiac troponin)。
15. **BNP was elevated at 7000:** BNP升高是心力衰竭的指標，支持 I5024 的編碼。

9.  **02 80% on RA:** ICD-10 編碼 R09.02 (Hypoxemia)。這是低血氧症的症狀。
10. **PNA (Pneumonia):** ICD-10 編碼 J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism)。這是患者曾被懷疑的診斷，儘管後續證據不支持，但仍需記錄。
11. **Atelectasis:** ICD-10 編碼 J98.81 (Other specified respiratory disorders)。這是胸部 X 光顯示的併發症。
12. **Refusing medications, including torsemide in her nursing home:** ICD-10 編碼 Z91.11 (Noncompliance with drug therapy)。這是患者不遵從藥物治療的行為。
13. **Right VATS pericardial window, right pleural drain placement by Thoracic Surgery (right chest tube removed ___):** ICD-10 編碼 0W900ZZ (Drainage of pericardium, open approach) 和 0W903ZZ (Drainage of pleural cavity, open approach)。這些是手術程序的編碼。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Altered Mental Status (AMS):** 患者表現出意識狀態改變，包括在黑暗中坐著並告訴家人她需要去透析（儘管已經完成透析），以及在夜間醒來使用廁所時開始洗澡並告訴丈夫她要去上班。這些行為異常表明存在意識混亂。因此，R41.81 (Disorientation) 是一個合適的編碼。
2.  **Weakness:** 患者報告有虛弱感，且丈夫提到她有幾次不穩定並需要協助到車上。這表明存在虛弱症狀。因此，R53.1 (Weakness) 是一個合適的編碼。
3.  **Dysuria x 2 days:** 患者因尿路感染 (UTI) 有2天的排尿困難。這是一個症狀，因此，N39.0 (Dysuria) 是一個合適的編碼。
4.  **UTI treated with Bactrim:** 患者因尿路感染被給予Bactrim，且症狀有所緩解。這表明存在尿路感染。因此，N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified) 是一個合適的編碼。
5.  **ESRD on HD T/ThSa:** 患者有終末期腎臟病，並在週三、週五、週日進行血液透析。這是一個慢性疾病。因此，N18.6 (End-stage renal disease) 是一個合適的編碼。
6.  **Schizophrenia:** 患者有精神分裂症病史。這是一個慢性精神疾病。因此，F20.9 (Schizophrenia, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼。
7.  **Allergies:** 患者有多種藥物過敏史，包括Haldol、Klonopin、Ativan、Risperdal、Zyprexa、Seroquel、Penicillins、Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)、Chlorpromazine、Trifluoperazine。這些過敏史應被編碼。因此，Z91.011 (Allergy to antipsychotic drugs)、Z91.012 (Allergy to anxiolytic drugs)、Z91.013 (Allergy to anticonvulsants)、Z91.014 (Allergy to antibiotics)、Z91.015 (Allergy to sulfonamide drugs) 是合適的編碼。
8.  **Hypotension (104/52):** 患者的收縮壓為104，舒張壓為52，這表明低血壓。因此，R03.0 (Hypotension) 是一個合適的編碼。
9.  **Fever (100.8):** 患者的體溫為100.8°F，這表明發燒。因此，R50.9 (Fever, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼。
10. **Tachycardia (102):** 患者的心跳為102次/分鐘，這表明心跳過速。因此，R00.2 (Tachycardia) 是一個合適的編碼。
11. **Tachypnea (18):** 患者的呼吸頻率為18次/分鐘，這表明呼吸急促。因此，R06.02 (Tachypnea) 是一個合適的編碼。
12. **Hypoxemia (97% RA):** 患者的血氧飽和度為97%，這表明輕度低氧血症。因此，R09.02 (Hypoxemia) 是一個合適的編碼。
