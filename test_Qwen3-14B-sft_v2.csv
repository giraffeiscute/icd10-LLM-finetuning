<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Agitation and psychosis (Chief Complaint):** 患者因躁動和精神病入院，且病史中提到「recurrent admission to the hospital for psychosis」，這表明精神病是主要的診斷。因此，F20.9 (Schizophrenia, unspecified) 是一個合理的選擇，儘管病史中提到「bipolar vs. schizoaffective disorder」，但當前症狀更符合精神病的表現。
2.  **History of bipolar vs. schizoaffective disorder:** 這是一個重要的既往病史，即使當前症狀更符合精神病，也應記錄。F31.9 (Bipolar affective disorder, current episode unspecified) 可以用來表示雙極障礙的既往史。
3.  **CAD s/p RCA stent (___):** 患者有冠狀動脈疾病史，並接受了右冠狀動脈支架植入術。I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 用於描述冠狀動脈疾病，而Z95.5 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft) 用於表示支架的存在。
4.  **DM type II:** 患者有第二型糖尿病史。E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 用於表示糖尿病。
5.  **Substance acute:** 患者有急性物質使用史。F19.90 (Other substance abuse, uncomplicated) 用於表示其他物質濫用。
6.  **Off her medications:** 患者目前未服藥，這是一個重要的臨床資訊，可能影響其症狀。Z91.11 (Noncompliance with medical treatment) 用於表示未遵從醫囑。
7.  **Brother died 2 days ago:** 患者兄弟去世是近期的壓力事件，可能與其精神症狀有關。Z63.4 (Bereavement) 用於表示喪親。
8.  **Allergies: Haldol / Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics):** 患者對Haldol、青黴素和磺胺類抗生素過敏。Z88.0 (Allergy to antipsychotic drugs) 用於表示對抗精神病藥物的過敏，Z88.3 (Allergy to penicillin) 用於表示對青黴素的過敏，Z88.4 (Allergy to sulfonamide drugs) 用於表示對磺胺類藥物的過敏。
9.  **Homeless shelter:** 患者居住在無家可歸者收容所，這是一個重要的社會人口學資訊。Z59.0 (Homelessness) 用於表示無家可歸。
10. **Labile glucose management (FICU admission):** 患者曾因血糖不穩定入院，這表明糖尿病控制不佳。Z79.4 (Long term (current) use of insulin) 用於表示長期使用胰島素，Z89.2 (Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus) 用於表示糖尿病控制不佳。
11. **Naked screaming and yelling at people:** 患者在街上赤裸裸地尖叫並對人喊叫，這是一種行為異常。R45.810 (Other specified abnormal behavior) 用於表示其他指定的異常行為。
12. **Did not want to talk, but denied chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain:** 患者不願談話，但否認胸痛、呼吸困難或腹痛，這表明她目前沒有急性症狀，但存在精神狀態改變。R41.82 (Unspecified disturbance of consciousness) 用於表示未指定的意識障礙。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Oxaliplatin desensitization** - 這是一個就診原因，不是診斷，通常不編碼。
2.  **H/o metastatic colorectal cancer on CapeOx (___)** - 這表明患者有轉移性結直腸癌，且正在接受化療。轉移性結直腸癌的 ICD-10 編碼是 C18.9 (未指明的結腸癌) 和 C19.9 (未指明的直腸癌)。由於是轉移性，需要添加 C78.5 (其他消化系統器官的轉移)。此外，患者正在接受化療，這是一個重要的治療狀態，編碼 Z51.11 (化療)。
3.  **HTN (Hypertension)** - 高血壓的 ICD-10 編碼是 I10 (原發性高血壓)。
4.  **Depression** - 抑鬱症的 ICD-10 編碼是 F33.9 (未指明的重性抑鬱發作)。
5.  **Allergies: Penicillins / Tylenol Cold-Flu Severe Night / lisinopril / oxaliplatin** - 這些是過敏史。Penicillins (青黴素) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.0 (青黴素過敏史)。Tylenol Cold-Flu Severe Night (泰諾感冒藥) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.2 (非青黴素抗生素過敏史)。Lisinopril (利辛普利) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.3 (ACE 抑制劑過敏史)。Oxaliplatin (奧沙利鉑) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.6 (化療藥物過敏史)。
6.  **On ___ C2D1 FOLFOX, the patient developed oxaliplatin during infusion. At that time, he experienced chills and rigors. He then developed pain in his back and chest, as well as itching. He was noted to be flushed and was treated with 25 mg of Benadryl, 50 mg of hydrocortisone, 20 mg of Pepcid, and 10 mg of Decadron. His symptoms then resolved over the course of 30 minutes. Blood cultures at that time were negative.** - 這描述了患者對奧沙利鉑的過敏反應。由於患者已進行過皮膚測試並確診為過敏，且目前是為了進行脫敏治療而就診，因此這是一個過敏反應的歷史，而不是當前的急性事件。因此，不編碼急性過敏反應，而是編碼過敏史 Z88.6。
7.  **Allergy recommend all future oxaliplatin infusions be administered using a 12-step/3 bag desensitization inpatient protocol.** - 這表明患者需要進行脫敏治療，這是一個重要的治療計劃，編碼 Z51.11 (化療) 已經涵蓋了化療本身，而脫敏治療是化療的一部分。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: wound dehiscence** (主要主訴：傷口裂開)：這是一個急性問題，對應 ICD-10 編碼 **Z90.511** (Dehiscence of surgical wound of head, neck, and trunk)。由於是頸部後路脊柱手術的傷口裂開，因此選擇 Z90.511。
2.  **History of Present Illness: cervical spondylosis and stenosis** (病史：頸椎退化性關節炎和脊髓腔狹窄)：這是導致手術的基礎疾病，對應 ICD-10 編碼 **M47.16** (Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: status post posterior laminectomy C3 C4 C5 C6-C7 and laminectomy at T1, fusion C3-T1** (病史：頸部後路椎板切除術 C3 C4 C5 C6-C7 和 T1 椎板切除術，C3-T1 融合術)：這是手術的描述，對應 ICD-10 編碼 **Z90.511** (Dehiscence of surgical wound of head, neck, and trunk) 已經涵蓋了傷口裂開的後果，而手術本身作為過去的程序，通常不編碼為診斷，除非有後遺症或併發症需要持續管理。
4.  **History of Present Illness: wound dehiscence** (病史：傷口裂開)：這已經在 Z90.511 中涵蓋。
5.  **History of Present Illness: no worsening neck pain, fever, weakness, numbness or tingling, in fact, states that his hand numbness has been improving post-op. Denies bowel or bladder dysfunction.** (病史：無頸部疼痛惡化、發燒、無力、麻木或刺痛，事實上，他表示他的手部麻木症狀在手術後有所改善。否認大小便功能障礙。)：這些是對症狀的否定，通常不編碼為診斷，除非有明確的症狀需要處理。
6.  **Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions** (過敏史：無已知過敏史/不良藥物反應)：無需編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   **M47.16** (Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy)：頸椎退化性關節炎伴脊髓病變，是手術的基礎疾病。

1.  **Chief Complaint: Word finding difficulty, recurrent left frontal brain lesion** - 這表明患者有語言困難和腦部病變的症狀。

3.  **Recent follow up MRI showed a new area of contrast-enhancement at the margins of the radiation field with associated edema. It is unclear whether this is radiation necrosis or recurrent/new metastatic disease.** - 這表明存在腦部病變，但尚未明確是放射性壞死還是復發/新發的轉移。由於患者接受了活組織檢查，且病史中提到「recurrent left frontal brain lesion」，最合理的假設是復發或新發的轉移。因此，C79.31 (Brain metastases from malignant neoplasm of lung) 是最合適的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: trauma with fall** - 患者因跌倒導致創傷就醫，這是一個重要的主訴。雖然病史中沒有詳細描述跌倒的具體原因，但這是一個導致當前症狀的直接原因。因此，應編碼為 Y92.09 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause of injury) 來表示跌倒的環境因素。
2.  **History of Present Illness: prolonged down time with loss of motion of his R ankle** - 患者主訴右腳踝活動受限，這是主要的症狀。由於病史中提到這是因為「cramping sensation in his foot and lower leg」，這表明是肌肉痙攣導致的活動受限。因此，應編碼為 M25.511 (Muscle cramp, right leg)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: strange sensation in his foot with the inability to move the foot or ankle** - 患者描述右腳有異常感覺，且無法活動腳踝。這進一步支持了肌肉痙攣的診斷，並強調了右腿的症狀。因此，M25.511 仍然是合適的編碼。
4.  **History of Present Illness: some finger parasthesias** - 患者主訴右手指有異常感覺。這是一個神經系統症狀，應編碼為 R20.2 (Parasthesia)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: diffuse parasthesias in the R hand** - 患者描述右手中有異常感覺。這進一步支持了 R20.2 的診斷。
6.  **History of Present Illness: active IV cocaine user** - 患者是活躍的靜脈注射可卡因使用者。這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼為 F14.20 (Cocaine dependence, uncomplicated)。
7.  **History of Present Illness: cocaine binge yesterday** - 患者在跌倒前一天有可卡因暴食。這是一個導致當前症狀的直接原因，應編碼為 T40.1X5A (Poisoning by cocaine, initial encounter)。
8.  **History of Present Illness: CK is 35,000** - 患者的肌酸酐激酶 (CK) 水平顯著升高，這通常與肌肉損傷或痙攣相關。這是一個重要的實驗室檢查結果，應編碼為 R74.0 (Elevated creatine kinase)。
9.  **History of Present Illness: pain is ""not that bad"" and feels like a cramping sensation in his foot and lower leg** - 患者描述疼痛不嚴重，但感覺像腳和小腿的痙攣。這進一步支持了 M25.511 的診斷。

*   T40.1X5A (Poisoning by cocaine, initial encounter) - 可卡因使用導致的中毒，是當前症狀的直接原因。
*   Y92.09 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause of injury) - 跌倒的環境因素。
*   M25.511 (Muscle cramp, right leg) - 右腿肌肉痙攣，導致活動受限和疼痛。

逐步推理：
1.  **G4P0212 (Gravida 4, Para 0212):** 這表示患者是第四次懷孕，之前有兩次流產、一次早產和一次足月生產。這對編碼有幫助，但本身不是一個診斷碼。

3.  **planned physical-exam indicated cerclage (計劃的體格檢查指示縫紉術):** 這表明患者有需要縫紉術的風險，通常與早產風險相關。
4.  **anatomic survey and f/u cervical length (解剖學檢查和隨訪子宮頸長度):** 這表明患者正在接受子宮頸長度的監測，這通常是為了評估早產風險。
5.  **Cervix 1.5 cm in length with funneling (子宮頸長度 1.5 公分，伴有漏斗形):** 這是一個重要的發現，表明子宮頸短且有漏斗形，這會增加早產風險。對應 ICD-10 編碼 O42.9 (未指明原因的子宮頸功能不全)。
6.  **on speculum exam was visually 1 cm dilated (陰道鏡檢查時可見 1 公分擴張):** 這表明子宮頸有一定程度的擴張，這也是早產風險的徵兆。
7.  **Last week on her ultrasound the cervix was 2-3 cm in length (上周的超聲波檢查顯示子宮頸長度為 2-3 公分):** 這進一步支持了子宮頸短的診斷。
8.  **Reports mild intermittent cramping today; denies contractions. No VB, LOF or change in vaginal discharge. Normal FM x 2. (報告今天有輕度間歇性絞痛；否認宮縮。沒有陰道出血、陰道流液或陰道分泌物的變化。胎心正常 x 2。):** 這些是症狀和檢查結果，但沒有指向特定的診斷碼，除了胎心正常 (Z3A.00)。
9.  **Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Aspirin (過敏史: 青黴素 / 磺胺類藥物 / 阿司匹林):** 這些是重要的患者信息，應編碼為 Z91.011 (青黴素過敏)、Z91.012 (磺胺類藥物過敏) 和 Z91.018 (其他藥物過敏)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath (SOB)** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但通常會有更具體的診斷或原因。在病史中，患者提到有「two pillow orthopnea」，這表明存在呼吸困難，特別是躺下時。因此，I50.81 (Other forms of congestive heart failure) 可能適用，因為這通常會導致呼吸困難。
2.  **History of aortic insufficiency followed by serial echocardiogram. His most recent echocardiogram showed moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation now with a significantly depressed LV function and dilated left ventricle.** - 這描述了主動脈瓣和二尖瓣的嚴重反流，以及左心室功能嚴重下降和擴張。這些是心臟瓣膜病變和心力衰竭的明確診斷。
    *   **I35.0 (Aortic valve insufficiency)** - 主動脈瓣反流。
    *   **I34.0 (Mitral valve insufficiency)** - 二尖瓣反流。
    *   **I50.81 (Other forms of congestive heart failure)** - 由於左心室功能嚴重下降和擴張，這表明存在心力衰竭。
    *   **I51.9 (Unspecified heart failure)** - 作為心力衰竭的補充，特別是當 I50.81 未完全涵蓋所有症狀時。
3.  **Moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation now with a significantly depressed LV function and dilated left ventricle.** - 這進一步強化了心臟瓣膜病變和心力衰竭的診斷。
4.  **He has spent the last month in ___. Since we last saw him, he has completed his dental work in preparation for cardiac surgery. He was is scheduled to return to his dentist for final clearance this ___.** - 這表明患者即將接受心臟手術，即主動脈瓣和二尖瓣的修復/置換。這些是即將進行的程序，而不是診斷。
5.  **Over the past few weeks he has had two pillow orthopnea. He was admitted and worked up and ruled out for aortitis and PE. He was diuresed for pleural effusion.** - 這表明患者有呼吸困難，且曾因胸腔積液而接受利尿劑治療。這支持了心力衰竭的診斷。

逐步推理：
1.  **Large left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with midline shift 4 mm:** 這是患者此次就診的主要原因，也是導致其意識狀態改變和頭痛的直接原因。這是一個急性腦出血，且有中線偏移，屬於嚴重的腦出血。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 I61.21 (Intraparenchymal hemorrhage of left cerebral hemisphere) 和 R29.19 (Other symptoms and signs involving consciousness)。
2.  **Altered mental status:** 這是患者就診的主訴之一，也是腦出血的症狀。雖然 I61.21 已經涵蓋了腦出血本身，但 R29.19 可以用來描述意識狀態的改變。
3.  **Right pronator drift, decreased sensation to light touch in the right upper extremity and lower extremity:** 這些是腦出血後的神經學體徵，表明存在神經功能缺損。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 R27.0 (Ataxia) 和 R29.19 (Other symptoms and signs involving consciousness)。
4.  **Intubated for airway protection:** 這是一個重要的治療措施，表明患者需要呼吸支持。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z99.11 (Artificial airway in situ)。
5.  **Transferred from an outside hospital:** 這是一個轉院的背景信息，對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.0 (Patient transferred from another hospital)。
6.  **History of studying ___ at ___:** 這是一個背景信息，沒有對當前診斷或治療產生直接影響，因此不需要編碼。
7.  **Elevated white count to 13.5:** 這是一個實驗室檢查結果，但沒有明確的診斷意義，因此不需要編碼。
8.  **Potassium of 3.5:** 這是一個實驗室檢查結果，但沒有明確的診斷意義，因此不需要編碼。
9.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 這是一個重要的病史信息，對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
10. **Cerebral angiogram ___:** 這是一個診斷性檢查，對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z18.0 (Encounter for cerebral angiography)。
11. **Given 1 g of Keppra as well as 100 mg of mannitol:** 這些是治療措施，不是診斷，因此不需要編碼。
12. **Started on propofol drip as well as fentanyl boluses:** 這些是治療措施，不是診斷，因此不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath.** 這是一個症狀，但病史中提供了更明確的診斷，因此可能不需要單獨編碼。
2.  **hx non-infarct related CMP (EF ___, ICD for primary prevention):** 這表示患者有非心肌梗死相關的充血性心力衰竭，且射血分數為 ___，並植入了 ICD 用於原發性預防。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I5024 (Congestive heart failure, systolic, with reduced ejection fraction) 和 I252 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。ICD 植入是治療手段，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
3.  **hx metastatic papillary thyroid cancer:** 這表示患者有轉移性乳頭狀甲狀腺癌。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 C73 (Malignant neoplasm of thyroid)。
4.  **recent discovery of lung nodules (unclear if primary lung or metastatic endocrine cancer):** 這表示患者最近發現肺部結節，但尚未明確是原發性肺癌還是轉移性內分泌癌。由於尚未確診，這應編碼為 R918 (Unspecified abnormal findings of the respiratory system)。
5.  **recent admission ___ for VT ablation which was unsuccessful:** 這表示患者最近因心室性心搏過速 (VT) 就診，但消融術未成功。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I471 (Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia)。
6.  **presents with hypotension and presyncope in setting of increased diuretic doses:** 這表示患者因利尿劑劑量增加而出現低血壓和暈厥前兆。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I959 (Other adverse effects of drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
7.  **On ___, he developed worsening exertional dyspnea and was instructed to increase his lasix dose from 40 mg daily to 80 mg daily (taken as 40mg BID) for 3d. He took the medication for 4d.** 這進一步支持了充血性心力衰竭的診斷，並解釋了低血壓和暈厥前兆的原因。
8.  **Additionally, patient notes that he was previously taking digoxin, and was started on quinidine BID on ___. Patient was unclear on whether or not to continue digoxin, so he continued it through ___ and did not take it on ___.** 這表示患者有使用洋地黃和奎寧的病史，但未明確表示是當前用藥。由於這些是治療手段，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
9.  **Allergies: Prevacid / ciprofloxacin / Vicodin / Percocet / dopamine:** 這些是患者的過敏史，應編碼為 Z91011 (Allergy to drug, unspecified)。

逐步推理：
1.  **急性胰臟炎 (Acute Pancreatitis):** 患者因食用 pecan pie 後出現腹痛、噁心、嘔吐，並在 ED 檢查中發現血清脂肪酶升高 (457) 和 CT 显示胰頭周圍有輕度炎症變化，這些都是急性胰臟炎的明確診斷。因此，編碼 K85.90 (急性未特指的胰臟炎，未併發症) 是最合適的。
2.  **腹痛 (Abdominal Pain):** 患者主訴腹痛，且這是急性胰臟炎的常見症狀。雖然胰臟炎本身已涵蓋了腹痛，但 K85.90 本身也包含腹痛的症狀，因此不需要額外編碼 R109。
3.  **噁心和嘔吐 (Nausea and Vomiting):** 患者主訴噁心和嘔吐，且這些是急性胰臟炎的常見症狀。K85.90 已涵蓋這些症狀，因此不需要額外編碼 R117 (噁心) 和 R111 (嘔吐)。
4.  **高血壓 (Hypertension):** 患者有高血壓病史，且這是慢性疾病。編碼 I10 (原發性高血壓) 是正確的。
5.  **高脂血症 (Hyperlipidemia):** 患者有高脂血症病史，且這是慢性疾病。編碼 E785 (高脂血症) 是正確的。
6.  **胰臟炎的併發症 (Complications of Pancreatitis):** 患者有腹脹 (abdominal fullness) 和上腹壓痛 (epigastric tenderness when pushed)。這些是急性胰臟炎的併發症，應編碼 K86.0 (急性胰臟炎併發症)。
7.  **頭痛 (Headache):** 患者報告有輕度頭痛。編碼 R510 (頭痛) 是正確的。
8.  **脂肪肝 (Steatosis):** 患者在 RUQ 超音波檢查中發現脂肪肝。編碼 K7600 (非酒精性脂肪肝) 是正確的。
9.  **左側附件囊性結構 (Left Adnexal Cystic Structure):** 患者在 CT 檢查中發現 5.3 cm 左側附件囊性結構，且描述為簡單囊性結構。這是一個良性發現，應編碼 N83.2 (卵巢囊腫)。
10. **低鈉血症 (Hyponatremia):** 患者在 ED 檢查中發現血鈉 132，這屬於輕度低鈉血症。編碼 E87.1 (低鈉血症) 是正確的。
11.  **輕度低血壓 (Mild Hypotension):** 患者在 ED 檢查中血壓為 130/70，這在正常範圍內。然而，患者在轉院前的血壓為 153/96，這屬於輕度高血壓。由於患者有高血壓病史，且轉院前的血壓升高，這可以視為高血壓的急性加重，因此編碼 I10 已涵蓋，不需要額外編碼。
12.  **輕度高血糖 (Mild Hyperglycemia):** 患者病歷中未提及血糖值或糖尿病病史，因此不編碼。
13.  **輕度高乳酸血症 (Mild Hyperlactatemia):** 患者在 ED 檢查中乳酸為 2.2，這屬於輕度升高。編碼 R7581 (乳酸升高) 是正確的。
14.  **輕度肝功能異常 (Mild Liver Function Abnormalities):** 患者在 ED 檢查中 AST 65 和 ALT 54，這屬於輕度肝功能異常。編碼 R7409 (其他肝功能檢查異常) 是正確的。
15.  **輕度白血球增多 (Mild Leukocytosis):** 患者在 ED 檢查中白血球為 12.5，這屬於輕度白血球增多。編碼 R7989 (其他白血球計數異常) 是正確的。

逐步推理：
1.  **T10 and L5 compression fractures (new):** 這些是主要的診斷和手術原因。由於是壓縮性骨折，且未提及病理性骨折，應編碼為 M80.00 (Spontaneous compression fracture of vertebra, unspecified site)。由於是新發的，且未提及病理性，因此選擇 M80.00。
2.  **Plan for surgery (L5 kyphopasty):** 這是一個手術程序，但不是診斷。在 ICD-10 編碼中，手術本身不編碼為診斷，除非是術後併發症或需要跟蹤的狀態。
3.  **History of CAD s/p LCx PCI (BMS x3):** 這是一個慢性病史。冠狀動脈疾病 (CAD) 應編碼為 I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。支架置入是過去的治療，不編碼為當前診斷。
4.  **ICM (EF 35%):** 這表示心臟功能不全。射血分數 35% 指出中度至重度心臟功能不全。應編碼為 I50.22 (Congestive heart failure, systolic, with reduced ejection fraction)。
5.  **LBBB:** 左束支傳導阻滯是心臟的電生理異常。應編碼為 I44.1 (Left bundle-branch block)。
6.  **pAF on Coumadin:** 慢性心房顫動，正在服用抗凝劑。應編碼為 I48.91 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) 和 Z79.01 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants)。
7.  **Moderate MR:** 二尖瓣中度反流。應編碼為 I34.1 (Mitral valve insufficiency)。
8.  **Mild AS:** 主動脈瓣輕度狹窄。應編碼為 I35.0 (Aortic valve stenosis)。
9.  **HTN:** 高血壓。應編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
10. **Hip fracture:** 髋部骨折是既往病史。應編碼為 S72.00XA (Unspecified fracture of unspecified femur, initial encounter for closed fracture)。
11. **UGIB ___ requiring MICU admission i/s/o INR 14:** 這是一個重要的既往病史，涉及胃腸道出血和凝血功能異常。胃腸道出血應編碼為 K65.5 (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage)。INR 14 指出凝血功能異常，應編碼為 D68.69 (Other specified coagulation defects)。
12. **COPD:** 慢性阻塞性肺病。應編碼為 J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified)。
13. **Hydrochlorothiazide allergy:** 這是一個重要的過敏史。應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to diuretics)。
14. **Penicillins allergy:** 這是一個重要的過敏史。應編碼為 Z91.012 (Allergy to penicillins)。
15. **Back pain:** 這是主要的主訴，但由於有壓縮性骨折作為明確的診斷，背痛通常不單獨編碼，除非是主要的症狀或疼痛管理的重點。

4.  **Weakness, ataxia, fatigue, progressive weakness in lower extremities, feeling like her feet feel spongy, wheelchair bound, only able to transfer to wheelchair, MRI of the brain to evaluate for mets (reported negative):** 這些症狀和檢查結果指向神經系統功能障礙。R27.0 (Ataxia) 用於表示共濟失调。
5.  **B12 deficiency, had IM repletion x 6 weeks:** 患者有維生素B12缺乏症，且已進行了肌肉注射補充。D51.1 (Pernicious anemia) 用於表示惡性貧血，這是一種B12缺乏的嚴重形式。
6.  **Ferritin elevated to 3000 with concern for hemochromatosis:** 患者有鐵蛋白升高，這與血色素沉著症的診斷一致，已由D89.8涵蓋。
7.  **Decreased oral intake, multiple episodes of non bloody non bilious emesis over the past 3 weeks, intermittent constipation and diarrhea, hair thinning:** 這些症狀表明患者有進食障礙和消化系統問題。R63.4 (Malnutrition) 已涵蓋營養不良，R11.10 (Nausea without vomiting) 用於表示噁心，R19.7 (Other specified symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen) 用於表示其他指定的消化系統症狀和腹部症狀。
8.  **Hypotension, appeared unwell, felt dizzy, hypotensive 68/45, HR 145, febrile to 101.4 in the ED:** 這些症狀表明患者有低血壓和發燒。R03.0 (Hypotension) 用於表示低血壓，R50.9 (Fever, unspecified) 用於表示發燒。
9.  **Scleral icterus, brown guaiac negative stool, fast exam negative:** 這些症狀表明患者有黃疸。R17.0 (Jaundice) 用於表示黃疸。

逐步推理：
1.  **posterior fossa dural AVM (後顱窩硬腦膜動靜脈畸形)**：這是病人的主要診斷，也是手術的原因。對應 ICD-10 編碼 I60.81 (Other cerebral arteriovenous malformations)。
2.  **headache (頭痛)**：這是病人的主訴之一，且是促使進行影像學檢查的原因。對應 ICD-10 編碼 R51.0 (Headache)。
3.  **MRI/MRA showed a full cavernous sinus suspicious for a dural AVM (MRI/MRA 顯示充滿岩上竇，懷疑是硬腦膜動靜脈畸形)**：這是一個影像學發現，支持了 AVM 的診斷，但本身不是一個獨立的診斷。通常不單獨編碼。
4.  **cerebral angiogram which confirmed diagnosis (腦血管造影確認診斷)**：這是一個診斷程序，不是一個診斷本身。
5.  **left hemifacial spasm (左側半面痙攣)**：這是病人的既往病史，且是其就診的另一個原因。對應 ICD-10 編碼 G57.0 (Hemifacial spasm)。
6.  **followed in the ___ clinic for left hemifacial spasm for about ___ year (在 ___ 門診跟進左側半面痙攣約 ___ 年)**：這進一步強化了 G57.0 的診斷。
7.  **no family history of aneurysm (無動脈瘤家族史)**：這是一個負面的家族史，通常不編碼，除非有特定的遺傳性動脈瘤疾病。
8.  **nonsmoker (非吸煙者)**：這是一個負面的個人史，通常不編碼，除非有特定的吸煙相關疾病。
9.  **no Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions (無已知過敏史/不良藥物反應)**：這是一個負面的個人史，通常不編碼，除非有特定的過敏或不良反應。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pain, elevated troponins, and history of CAD s/p stent x4:** 這些是心肌梗死的強烈指標。患者有胸痛、肌鈣蛋白升高，且有冠狀動脈疾病史。因此，I21.4 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction) 是最合適的編碼。
2.  **Crescendo angina over the past several weeks to months:** 這表示患者有心絞痛，且是導致心肌梗死的潛在原因。I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 用於描述冠狀動脈疾病，而 R07.0 (Angina pectoris) 用於描述心絞痛。
3.  **Minor fender-bender because he misjudged the distance to the next car:** 這是一個交通意外，且是患者近期的事件。V17.1 (Unspecified motor vehicle traffic accident) 用於描述未指定的機動車交通事故。
4.  **Intermittent ""fogginess"" and difficulty with speech:** 這表明患者有輕度的認知或語言障礙。R47.89 (Other specified symptoms and signs involving cognitive functions and awareness) 用於描述其他指定的認知功能和意識症狀。
5.  **He is a lawyer and states that this is out of character for him:** 這進一步支持了認知功能障礙的診斷。
6.  **Intermittent difficulty articulating words, they sound slightly garbled to him:** 這表明患者有輕度的語言障礙。R47.89 也涵蓋了語言障礙。
7.  **He reported that in the past it is radiated down his left arm but tonight it was just in the ___ his chest was relatively mild at about 3 out of 10. He reported his pain is worse with inspiration and is not positional or exertional. He had nausea with this pain and lightheadedness:** 這些是心肌梗死的症狀，已由 I21.4 涵蓋。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Coughing up blood (咯血)**：患者主訴咯血，且病史中多次提到咯血，是本次就診的主要原因。因此，R04.2 (Hemoptysis) 是主要診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: h/o bronchiectasis (支氣管擴張症)**：患者有支氣管擴張症病史，且CTA顯示雙側下葉和右中葉支氣管擴張症，是咯血的基礎疾病。因此，J47.1 (Bronchiectasis with (acute) exacerbation) 是重要的慢性疾病診斷。
3.  **History of Present Illness: hemoptysis s/p LUL bronchial artery embolization (咯血，曾接受左上葉支氣管動脈栓塞術)**：患者曾因咯血接受支氣管動脈栓塞術，且目前仍在考慮再次栓塞。因此，Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified surgical procedures) 是相關的個人手術史。
4.  **History of Present Illness: MGUS (單株免疫球蛋白病)**：患者有MGUS病史，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，D47.3 (Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) 是相關診斷。
5.  **History of Present Illness: intracranial hemorrhage (顱內出血)**：患者有顱內出血病史，是重要的既往病史。因此，I69.89 (Other specified after effects of cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage) 是相關診斷。
6.  **History of Present Illness: HTN (高血壓)**：患者有高血壓病史，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是相關診斷。
7.  **History of Present Illness: HLD (高脂血症)**：患者有高脂血症病史，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified) 是相關診斷。
8.  **History of Present Illness: prediabetes (糖尿病前期)**：患者有糖尿病前期病史，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，R73.03 (Prediabetes) 是相關診斷。
9.  **History of Present Illness: GERD (胃食道逆流)**：患者有胃食道逆流病史，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis) 是相關診斷。
10. **History of Present Illness: Stage 3 CKD (第三期慢性腎臟病)**：患者有第三期慢性腎臟病，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，N18.3 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3) 是相關診斷。
11. **History of Present Illness: conservatively managed renal mass (保守治療的腎臟腫塊)**：患者有保守治療的腎臟腫塊，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，R92.2 (Unspecified abnormal finding on renal imaging) 是相關診斷。
12. **History of Present Illness: hyperparathyroidism (副甲狀腺功能亢進)**：患者有副甲狀腺功能亢進病史，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，E21.0 (Hyperparathyroidism, unspecified) 是相關診斷。
13. **History of Present Illness: hypothyroidism (甲狀腺功能減退)**：患者有甲狀腺功能減退病史，是需要記錄的慢性疾病。因此，E03.9 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified) 是相關診斷。
14. **History of Present Illness: Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Penicillins / calcium**：患者對磺胺類抗生素、青黴素和鈣過敏，是重要的過敏史。因此，Z91.011 (Allergy to sulfonamide), Z91.012 (Allergy to penicillin), Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 是相關診斷。
15. **History of Present Illness: CTA was notable for b/l lower and RML bronchiectasis + mucus plugging with atelectasis without PE. Bronchoscopy in ___ was notable for small amt of purulent secretions in RML, small thrombus in LLL + large occlusive thrombu in lingula without active bleeding.**：CTA和支氣管鏡檢查結果顯示支氣管擴張症、黏液栓塞、肺不張、小血栓，這些是支氣管擴張症的急性加重表現。因此，J47.1 (Bronchiectasis with (acute) exacerbation) 已經涵蓋了這些發現。
16. **History of Present Illness: She received Levaquin 750mg q48h in ___ (allergic to PCN) and was fond to have 2 more episodes of hemoptysis (1 tbsp. each of bright red blood).**：患者因咯血接受左氧氟沙星治療，且有青黴素過敏史。因此，Z91.012 (Allergy to penicillin) 已經涵蓋了青黴素過敏史，而左氧氟沙星的使用是治療的一部分，不需單獨編碼。
17. **History of Present Illness: Given IV contrast allergy, poor renal fxn, they did not perform CT chest w/contrast.**：患者因對靜脈造影劑過敏和腎功能差，未進行CT胸腔造影。因此，Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 已經涵蓋了對靜脈造影劑的過敏史。
18. **History of Present Illness: She has not had any further episodes of hemoptysis since coming to ___ ___.**：患者自入院後未再出現咯血，表明咯血已得到控制，因此R04.2 (Hemoptysis) 是主要診斷，而J47.1 (Bronchiectasis with (acute) exacerbation) 是基礎疾病。
19. **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ___ Bronchoscopy**：患者接受了支氣管鏡檢查，是本次就診的重要手術。因此，Z49.81 (Encounter for bronchoscopy) 是相關診斷。
20. **History of Present Illness: pt is amenable to bronchoscopy, but refuses embolization, as it caused some lower abdominal swelling the last time this had been performed.**：患者拒絕再次進行栓塞術，是重要的患者偏好。因此，Z56.5 (Patient's refusal of medical care) 是相關診斷。

逐步推理：
1.  **""Things were falling apart"" / ""extremely depressed"" / ""depressed mood"" / ""depression"" / ""continued depression"" / ""depressed mood, poor sleep, anhedonia, poor motivation, fatigue, poor concentration, and hopelessness""**：這些是重度憂鬱症 (Major Depressive Disorder) 的典型症狀。因此，編碼 F33.2 (Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder, Current Episode Moderate) 是最合適的，表示目前處於中度發作的重複性重度憂鬱症。
2.  **""diagnosis of MDD and PTSD"" / ""nightmares and flashbacks related to the abuse"" / ""rape in the past"" / ""sexual trauma"" / ""worrying about her ex-partner, worrying if if she made the right decision by ending the relationship, and worrying about her reputation""**：這些描述了創傷後壓力症候群 (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) 的症狀，包括創傷回憶、焦慮和對安全的擔憂。因此，編碼 F43.10 (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Unspecified) 是最合適的。
3.  **""suicidal ideation"" / ""thoughts of suicide"" / ""worried what she will do if things continue to be this bad""**：這些是自殺意念的明確描述。因此，編碼 R45.810 (Suicidal ideation) 是必要的。
4.  **""history of sexual trauma"" / ""rape in the past from another male individual"" / ""sexual, and emotional abuse""**：這些是創傷事件的歷史，屬於創傷後壓力症候群的診斷基礎，但本身不是一個獨立的診斷編碼。
5.  **""recent admission to Deac 4 with diagnosis of MDD and PTSD""**：這強化了 MDD 和 PTSD 的診斷，並表明這是當前的問題。
6.  **""seasonal""**：這是患者的過敏史，編碼 Z91.013 (Allergy to pollen)。
7.  **""worrying about her ex-partner"" / ""worrying if if she made the right decision by ending the relationship"" / ""worrying about her reputation""**：這些是焦慮的表現，但由於 PTSD 已經涵蓋了創傷相關的焦慮，因此不需要額外編碼焦慮症。
8.  **""went to the police station today to further report her ex-partner's behavior""**：這是一個事件描述，不構成診斷編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Gi Bleed, Transfer**: 患者因胃腸道出血 (GIB) 轉院，且病歷中明確提到「maroon-colored guaiac-positive stool in his ostomy bag」，這表明是消化道出血。因此，K62.5 (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage) 是主要診斷。
2.  **Colon cancer (s/p resection and ostomy in ___, GIB (most recent ___)**: 患者有結腸癌病史，且最近一次胃腸道出血與結腸癌相關。因此，Z85.06 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of colon) 是重要的既往病史。
3.  **CHF with EF 25% s/p VF arrest ___ (no ICD in place)**: 患者有心臟衰竭病史，射血分數 25%，且曾有心室顫動 (VF) 停搏史，目前無植入式心臟除顫器 (ICD)。因此，I50.22 (Congestive heart failure, systolic) 和 I49.81 (Other cardiac arrhythmias) 是主要的慢性疾病。
4.  **multiple DVTs (including while on Coumadin and with life-threatening limb ischemia, now on Eliquis)**: 患者有多次深靜脈血栓病史，包括在服用華法林期間，且曾有嚴重的肢體缺血，目前服用利伐沙班 (Eliquis)。因此，I82.9 (Unspecified deep vein thrombosis) 和 Z86.711 (Personal history of deep vein thrombosis) 是重要的既往病史和慢性疾病。
5.  **Progressive feeling of tiredness over the last two months, as well as dyspnea on exertion after walking ___ years**: 患者有進展性的疲勞和勞力性呼吸困難，這與心臟衰竭的症狀相符，因此 R06.02 (Dyspnea) 和 R53.1 (Fatigue) 是相關的症狀。
6.  **Hematocrit dropped from 33-25**: 血紅細胞比容下降，這與胃腸道出血導致的貧血相關。因此，D62 (Anemia in chronic disease) 是貧血的診斷。
7.  **Transfused 1U PRBC at OSH**: 患者接受了1單位的紅血球輸注，這表明有貧血需要輸血。因此，Z99.2 (Transfusion reaction) 是輸血的相關診斷。
8.  **DNR/DNI**: 患者確認了不插管和不心肺復甦的指示，因此 Z61.89 (Other specified patient's refusal of medical treatment) 是重要的患者意願。
9.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions**: 患者無已知過敏史，因此 Z91.011 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 不適用。

逐步推理：
1.  **L ICA aneurysm (left internal carotid artery aneurysm):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是進行血管內栓塞手術的對象。ICD-10 編碼 I67.2 指的是腦動脈瘤，未指明部位。由於病歷中明確指出是左側頸內動脈 (L ICA) 的動脈瘤，最精確的編碼是 I67.21 (左頸內動脈動脈瘤)。
2.  **Pipeline embolization of left ICA paraclinoid aneurysm:** 這是一種治療動脈瘤的介入性手術。雖然 ICD-10 編碼中沒有專門針對 Pipeline 這種特定設備的編碼，但 I67.21 已經涵蓋了動脈瘤本身，而手術本身通常會在 ICD-10-PCS (Procedure Coding System) 中編碼，而不是 ICD-10-CM (診斷碼)。因此，這裡主要關注診斷碼。
3.  **Basilar aneurysm (基底動脈瘤):** 患者有基底動脈瘤的病史，且在 ___ 年已經進行了栓塞治療。病歷中提到 ""Angiogram ___ showed occluded basilar aneurysm""，表明基底動脈瘤已經被成功治療。因此，基底動脈瘤本身不再是當前的診斷，而是過去的病史。在 ICD-10 中，過去的已治療病史通常使用 Z86.79 (其他個人病史) 來表示。
4.  **Lung cancer (肺癌):** 患者有肺癌病史，且在基底動脈瘤的治療背景中被提及。病歷中沒有說明肺癌的當前狀態，因此假設為已治療或穩定。Z85.11 (肺癌個人病史) 是最合適的編碼。
5.  **Smoking history (吸煙史):** 患者有吸煙史，這在動脈瘤的治療決策中被提及為一個風險因素。Z87.891 (其他個人吸煙史) 是最合適的編碼。
6.  **Multiplicity of aneurysms (動脈瘤多發性):** 這是一個臨床描述，用於解釋治療選擇。在 ICD-10 中，這通常不作為獨立診斷編碼，而是作為其他診斷的附加信息。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   I67.21 (左頸內動脈動脈瘤) - 主要診斷，就診原因。
*   Z86.79 (其他個人病史) - 基底動脈瘤的個人病史。
*   Z85.11 (肺癌個人病史) - 肺癌的個人病史。
*   Z87.891 (其他個人吸煙史) - 吸煙史。

逐步推理：
1.  **Adenosquamous carcinoma of gallbladder (膽囊腺鱗癌)**: 這是病人的主要診斷。ICD-10 編碼 C24.0 代表膽囊的惡性腫瘤，而 C24.0 本身是膽囊癌的總稱，不區分組織學類型。雖然病史中提到是腺鱗癌，但 ICD-10 沒有更細的子碼來區分腺鱗癌，因此 C24.0 是最合適的選擇。
2.  **Fatigue (疲勞)**: 這是病人的主訴之一，且持續存在。ICD-10 編碼 R53.83 代表其他類型的疲勞。
3.  **Fever (發燒)**: 這是病人的主訴之一，且持續存在。ICD-10 編碼 R50.9 代表未指明的發燒。
4.  **Malaise (全身不適)**: 這是病人的主訴之一，且持續存在。ICD-10 編碼 R53.81 代表全身不適。
5.  **Decreased appetite (食慾減退)**: 這是病人的主訴之一。ICD-10 編碼 R63.0 代表食慾減退。
6.  **Weight loss (體重減輕)**: 這是病人的主訴之一。ICD-10 編碼 R63.4 代表體重減輕。
7.  **Penicillins allergy (青黴素過敏)**: 這是病人的既往病史。ICD-10 編碼 Z91.011 代表青黴素類藥物過敏。
8.  **Previously healthy (先前健康)**: 這是一個描述性短語，通常不編碼，除非有特定的健康狀態需要記錄。在此病例中，沒有其他健康狀態需要編碼，因此不添加額外的編碼。

2.  **History of Present Illness: Metastatic melanoma, currently on pembrolizumab therapy** - 這表明患者有轉移性黑色素瘤，且正在接受免疫治療。轉移性黑色素瘤的 ICD-10 編碼是 C80.0 (Melanoma of unspecified site, metastatic)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: Pelvic mass** - 這是一個重要的發現，且 CT 顯示其生長。由於這是黑色素瘤的轉移，應編碼為 C80.0 (Melanoma of unspecified site, metastatic)。然而，如果病歷中明確指出是「pelvic mass」且未指定為黑色素瘤轉移，則可能需要編碼 R19.8 (Other specified symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen)。但根據上下文，它更可能是黑色素瘤的轉移。
4.  **History of Present Illness: Worsening constipation** - 這是主要症狀之一，且與治療相關。由於患者正在接受 pembrolizumab 治療，且有「natural laxative」使用史，這可能導致便秘。因此，應編碼 K59.00 (Constipation, unspecified)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: Pembrolizumab therapy** - 這是一種免疫檢查點抑制劑，用於治療黑色素瘤。其不良反應可能導致便秘。因此，應編碼 T45.1X5A (Adverse effect of other antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter)。
6.  **History of Present Illness: Adverse effect of drugs (laxatives/opioids)** - 這在病歷中被提及，但主要的不良反應是 pembrolizumab。因此，T45.1X5A 已涵蓋。
7.  **History of Present Illness: Aspirin allergy** - 患者有 Celebrex (Celecoxib) 過敏史，這是一種非甾體抗炎藥 (NSAID)。因此，應編碼 Z91.011 (Allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs))。
8.  **History of Present Illness: Metastases to the lungs** - 這在病史中被提及，是黑色素瘤的轉移，已包含在 C80.0 中。
9.  **History of Present Illness: Autoimmune thyroiditis and hypophysitis** - 這些是 ipilimumab 治療的不良反應，但患者目前正在接受 pembrolizumab 治療，且這些是過去的不良反應。因此，應編碼 Z86.79 (Personal history of other specified adverse effects and other specified drug reactions)。
10. **History of Present Illness: Environmental factor of injury** - 這在病歷中未提及，因此不需要編碼。
11. **History of Present Illness: Chronic anemia, osteoporosis, hypertension, ataxia** - 這些是過去的病史，但未在本次就診中被提及或影響本次就診。因此，不需要編碼。
12. **History of Present Illness: Recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls** - 這在病歷中未提及，因此不需要編碼。
13. **History of Present Illness: Occipital scalp hematoma** - 這在病歷中未提及，因此不需要編碼。
14. **History of Present Illness: L hip X-ray were negative for acute process** - 這在病歷中未提及，因此不需要編碼。
15. **History of Present Illness: Laxative use** - 這導致了便秘，因此 K59.00 已涵蓋。
16. **History of Present Illness: Incontinence with diarrhea while sleeping** - 這在病歷中被提及，且與治療相關。因此，應編碼 K52.1 (Toxic gastroenteritis and colitis)。
17. **History of Present Illness: No brace required** - 這在病歷中未提及，因此不需要編碼。
18. **History of Present Illness: Early mobilization, pain control** - 這在病歷中未提及，因此不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Descending left colon cancer (主要診斷):**  C18.6 (Malignant neoplasm of descending colon)。這是病人的主要診斷，也是手術的原因。
2.  **Adenocarcinoma of the duodenum (既往病史):**  C26.0 (Malignant neoplasm of duodenum)。病史中提到患者曾接受 Whipple 手術治療十二指腸腺癌，這是一個重要的既往病史。
3.  **Adenocarcinoma (腫瘤類型):**  D00-D48 系列是良性、原位癌和惡性腫瘤的 ICD-10 編碼。C18.6 已經涵蓋了惡性腫瘤，因此不需要額外編碼 D00-D48。
4.  **Genetic workup (基因檢查):**  Z85.89 (Family history of other specified genetic disorders)。病史中提到患者已進行了廣泛的基因檢查，但未發現特定基因缺陷。這表明存在遺傳性疾病的家族史。
5.  **Aspirin / NSAIDS / anticoagulants allergy (過敏史):**  Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin), Z91.012 (Allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。患者對阿司匹林、NSAIDs 和抗凝血劑過敏，這些都應編碼。
6.  **Laparoscopic left colectomy (主要手術):**  Z40.01 (Encounter for surgical aftercare of colon)。這是手術後的隨訪，用於編碼手術後的就診。
7.  **Staging CT scan (分期 CT 扫描):**  Z85.89 (Family history of other specified genetic disorders) 已經涵蓋了基因檢查，而 CT 扫描本身是診斷的一部分，通常不單獨編碼為 ICD-10 編碼，除非有特定的發現需要編碼。
8.  **No evidence of metastatic disease (無轉移證據):**  這是一個陰性發現，通常不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼，除非有特定的轉移部位需要編碼。

1.  **Cough (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴是咳嗽，這是一個症狀。在沒有明確診斷為慢性咳嗽或特定病因的情況下，R05.9 (Unspecified cough) 是最合適的編碼。
2.  **Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe (LUL):** 病歷中明確指出左肺上葉發現中度分化鱗狀細胞癌，且活檢證實。這是一個主要的診斷。C34.11 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, left bronchus or lung) 是左肺上葉惡性腫瘤的正確編碼。
3.  **Extension of the mass into the 1st rib (initial concern):** 儘管後續的胸腔鏡檢查未發現第一肋骨或胸壁受累，但這是導致手術的初始原因之一。這是一個重要的臨床發現，應編碼為M896.0 (Malignant neoplasm of bone, unspecified site)。
4.  **PET showed concern for nodal disease:** 病歷中提到PET掃描顯示有淋巴結病變的疑慮，且進行了縱隔淋巴結切除。這表明存在區域性淋巴結轉移。C76.8 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified sites) 用於表示轉移性惡性腫瘤，而C76.81 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of mediastinum) 更具體地描述了縱隔淋巴結轉移。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: mutism, L facial twitching** - 這些是主要症狀，但通常會被更精確的診斷所取代。
2.  **Past Medical History: fibromyalgia** - 這是一個慢性疾病，應編碼為 M79.7。
3.  **History of Present Illness: fall resulting in headache and speech difficulties** - 這是一個重要的事件，導致了後續的症狀和檢查。
4.  **Headache and nausea** - 這些是跌倒後的症狀，但由於後續的檢查結果（CT頭部和頸部未見異常，CTA頭頸部顯示血管通暢）以及患者最終的症狀（失語、面部下垂、手部震顫）表明這些症狀可能與更嚴重的神經學問題相關，因此可能不需要單獨編碼。
5.  **Left lower face started twitching, this lasted several minutes and she subsequently noticed right-sided facial droop** - 這些是神經學症狀，提示可能的中風或神經功能障礙。
6.  **Acute onset aphemia and was unable to talk** - 這是一個重要的神經學症狀，提示失語症。
7.  **Both of her hands were tremulous** - 這是一個神經學症狀，提示震顫。

逐步推理：
1.  **Fever (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴為發燒，且病史中明確提到「two weeks of fever」，因此應編碼為 R50.9 (Fever, unspecified)。
2.  **HTN (Hypertension):** 患者有高血壓病史，應編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
3.  **HLD (Hyperlipidemia):** 患者有高血脂病史，應編碼為 E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。
4.  **Iodine / Iodinated Contrast Media - IV Dye (Allergy):** 患者對含碘造影劑過敏，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to iodinated contrast media)。
5.  **Mushroom picking and possible tick exposure:** 患者提到在森林中採菇，雖然沒有提到蜱蟲叮咬，但這是一個潛在的風險因素，可能與某些感染（如萊姆病）相關。因此，應編碼為 Y92.019 (Other specified place of occurrence of external cause) 來表示「其他指定的外部原因發生地點」，並編碼為 W51.81XA (Other specified tick bite, initial encounter) 來表示「其他指定的蜱蟲叮咬，初次就診」。
6.  **No other specific symptoms or diagnoses mentioned:** 病史中未提及其他具體症狀或診斷，因此不需要編碼其他 ICD-10 編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Slurred speech and right arm weakness:** 這些是急性中風的典型症狀。患者在醒來後不久出現這些症狀，且在短時間內逐漸惡化，這符合急性中風的表現。因此，最合理的診斷是急性中風，未指明腦血管區域，未指明是否為首次發作。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 I63.9。

6.  **Home health assistant:** 患者由家庭健康助手照顧，這表明患者需要長期照護，這是一個重要的背景資訊，需要編碼。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z53.5。
7.  **Last well known time at 1100:** 患者在 11:00 之後才出現症狀，這表明症狀是突然發生的，而不是慢性或漸進性的。這支持了急性中風的診斷，而不是慢性中風或中風後遺症。
8.  **No mention of prior stroke:** 病歷中沒有提到患者有過中風病史，因此不需要編碼中風後遺症或複發性中風。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Diarrhea and abdominal pain** - 這些是主要症狀，但通常會被更明確的診斷所取代。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Complete obstruction at the site of his prior anastomosis** - 這是一個重要的既往病史，表明患者有小腸梗阻的病史。由於患者現在有腹痛和腹瀉，且有右下腹膿腫，這可能與小腸梗阻的後遺症或併發症有關。因此，K56.6 (Small intestinal obstruction, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
3.  **History of Present Illness: Exploratory laparotomy, extensive LOA, ileocolectomy with new ileocolic anastomosis formation, and incicisional hernia repair** - 這些是手術史，表明患者有小腸切除和吻合術的病史，以及腹壁疝修復史。這些手術史本身不是診斷，但會影響當前的診斷和編碼。

7.  **History of Present Illness: Given ertapenem for a large right lower quadrant abscess** - 這表明膿腫是感染性的，因此 K35.81 (Other specified abscesses of abdominal wall and peritoneum) 是正確的選擇。
8.  **History of Present Illness: Mild abdominal tenderness** - 這是膿腫的症狀，通常包含在 K35.81 中。
9.  **History of Present Illness: Remote history of small bowel resection and ?right colectomy with ileocolic anastomosis** - 這些是重要的既往病史，表明患者有小腸切除和吻合術的病史，以及可能的右結腸切除史。這些手術史本身不是診斷，但會影響當前的診斷和編碼。
10. **History of Present Illness: Remote history of incicisional hernia repair** - 這是重要的既往病史，表明患者有腹壁疝修復史。這與膿腫的形成可能相關，但通常不作為主要診斷。
11. **Allergies: Penicillins** - 這是重要的過敏史，需要編碼。Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin) 是正確的編碼。
12. **History of Present Illness: Tolerating a diet and still passing gas** - 這表明患者目前的腸道功能尚可，但不能排除腸道梗阻的風險。
13. **History of Present Illness: Denies fevers or chills** - 這排除了某些感染性疾病的症狀，但不能排除膿腫的感染性。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Aneurysm** - 患者的主要主訴是動脈瘤，且後續的 MRA 確認了腦動脈瘤的存在。因此，I67.8 (Other cerebral aneurysm) 是主要診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Acute onset of left-sided hearing loss** - 患者出現急性左耳聽力喪失，且後續的 MRI 和 MRA 顯示了聽神經瘤的可能。儘管聽力在服用類固醇後有所改善，但這仍是一個重要的症狀和診斷。H91.13 (Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss) 是對此症狀的編碼。
3.  **MRI of the brain was obtained to evaluate the internal auditory canal for an acoustic neuroma** - 這表明聽神經瘤是導致聽力喪失的潛在原因。雖然聽力有所改善，但聽神經瘤本身仍是一個重要的診斷。C72.1 (Acoustic neuroma) 是對此的編碼。
4.  **MRA showed findings concerning for an intracranial aneurysm** - 這進一步支持了 I67.8 的診斷。
5.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pipeline embo left ICA** - 這是一個手術程序，通常會在病例中提及，但對於 ICD-10 編碼，除非是入院的主要原因，否則通常不編碼為診斷。在這種情況下，動脈瘤是入院的主要原因，因此手術是治療措施，而不是診斷。
6.  **Prednisone therapy** - 類固醇治療是用於改善聽力的，這表明聽力喪失是急性且需要治療的，支持 H91.13 的急性性質。
7.  **No neurological complaints. She denies headaches, weakness, numbness, tingling, diplopia or other concerning neurological findings.** - 這表明除了聽力喪失和聽神經瘤外，沒有其他神經系統症狀或診斷。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   I67.8 (Other cerebral aneurysm) - 主要診斷，動脈瘤。
*   C72.1 (Acoustic neuroma) - 聽神經瘤，導致聽力喪失。
*   H91.13 (Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss) - 急性左耳聽力喪失。

</think>
<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Patellar fracture after a fall at home (right knee):**  This is the primary reason for admission. The fracture is described as transverse, inferior, with minimal displacement, and non-operative management was recommended. The ICD-10 code for a displaced patellar fracture is S82.811A (Displaced fracture of right patella, initial encounter for closed fracture). Since the fracture is non-operative, it's still considered a closed fracture.
2.  **Knee pain:**  This is a symptom directly related to the patellar fracture. The ICD-10 code for knee pain is M25.56 (Pain in right knee).
3. **Fever:**  The patient was admitted due to a fever of 101°F. The ICD-10 code for fever is R50.9 (Fever, unspecified).
4. **Metastatic esophageal cancer s/p esophageal stenting, C2D1 ___ on ___:**  This is a significant underlying condition. The ICD-10 code for malignant neoplasm of the esophagus is C15.9 (Malignant neoplasm of esophagus, unspecified). Since it's metastatic, we also need to code the site of the metastasis. The patient has a metastatic lesion in the right patella, which is a bone metastasis. The ICD-10 code for malignant neoplasm of the right patella is C40.21 (Malignant neoplasm of right patella).
5. **Hx of metastatic esophageal cancer s/p esophageal stenting:**  This indicates a history of cancer treatment. The ICD-10 code for personal history of malignant neoplasm is Z85.819 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm).
6. **Weakness since his ___ cycle of chemotherapy:**  This is a symptom related to the patient's cancer treatment. The ICD-10 code for weakness is R53.1 (Weakness).
7. **N/V, initiated chemotherapy during that admission as well as palliative XRT to metastatic lesion in R patella:**  These are past medical history and treatment details, not current diagnoses. They are not assigned ICD-10 codes for this admission.
8. **Palliative XRT to metastatic lesion in R patella:**  This is a treatment for the bone metastasis, not a diagnosis itself.
9. **He has been weak since his ___ cycle of chemotherapy. pt reports weakness is generalized not focal. He was trying to get up out of bed and fell forward onto R knee w/ sudden onset severe pain and some swelling.**  This indicates that the fall was due to weakness, which is a contributing factor to the fracture. The ICD-10 code for fall due to other specified cause is W19.XXXA (Other specified fall, initial encounter).
10. **Environmental factor of injury (fall at home):**  The ICD-10 code for the place of occurrence of the fall is Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause).
11. **He has been weak since his ___ cycle of chemotherapy. pt reports weakness is generalized not focal. He was trying to get up out of bed and fell forward onto R knee w/ sudden onset severe pain and some swelling.**  This indicates that the fall was due to weakness, which is a contributing factor to the fracture. The ICD-10 code for fall due to other specified cause is W19.XXXA (Other specified fall, initial encounter).
12. **He has been weak since his ___ cycle of chemotherapy. pt reports weakness is generalized not focal.

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Dyspnea, hypoxia, and worsening shortness of breath:**  These are the primary presenting symptoms. Given the context of COPD and the recent exacerbation, the most specific code is **J44.1 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation)**. This code captures both the underlying COPD and the acute worsening.
2.  **COPD:**  This is a chronic condition and is already included in J44.1.
3.  **Cough, productive of sputum (whitish phlegm), and mild wheezing:**  These are symptoms of the COPD exacerbation and are included in J44.1.
4.  **Orthopnea and PND:**  These are symptoms of heart failure. Given the patient's history of CAD, HTN, CVA, PVD, and CKD, and the presence of BLE edema, **I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified)** is appropriate.
5.  **BLE edema:**  This is a symptom of heart failure and is included in I50.9.
6.  **URI symptoms (sore throat and rhinorrhea):**  These are acute symptoms. **J00.0 (Common cold with rhinitis)** is appropriate for a common cold with rhinitis.
7.  **CAD (Coronary Artery Disease):**  This is a chronic condition. **I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)** is appropriate for atherosclerotic heart disease without angina.

逐步推理：
1.  **Left shoulder skin redness (主要主訴)**：這是患者就診的主要原因，且後續診斷為左臂蜂窩性組織炎。因此，L03.111 (Cellulitis of left shoulder) 是最直接的編碼。
2.  **Left arm cellulitis (診斷)**：明確診斷為蜂窩性組織炎，且位於左臂。L03.111 (Cellulitis of left shoulder) 已涵蓋左肩，但左臂的蜂窩性組織炎可能需要更精確的編碼。然而，L03.111 已經是左肩的蜂窩性組織炎，而左臂的蜂窩性組織炎可能被視為左肩蜂窩性組織炎的擴展，因此 L03.111 仍為最合適的編碼。
3.  **Worsening cellulitis despite outpatient antibiotics (病史描述)**：這描述了蜂窩性組織炎的嚴重程度和治療反應，但本身不是一個獨立的診斷，而是 L03.111 的臨床表現。
4.  **Status post Left shoulder arthroscopy, biceps tenodesis, subacromial decompression (手術)**：這些是手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
5.  **Penicillins / latex (過敏史)**：患者對青黴素和乳膠過敏。Z88.2 (Allergy status to penicillin) 和 Z91.011 (Allergy to latex) 是正確的編碼。
6.  **History of Present Illness: ... presenting ~1 week post-op from a left shoulder arthroscopy with subacromial decompression and biceps tenodesis (病史)**：這描述了患者就診的背景，但不是一個獨立的診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。

1.  **RUL Lung Nodule (Right Upper Lobe Lung Nodule):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，且PET掃描顯示為FDG-avid，提示惡性可能性。因此，最合理的編碼是 R91.81 (Other specified abnormal findings of the lung) 來表示肺部異常發現，並在病歷中強烈懷疑惡性，但尚未確診。如果後續確診為惡性，應改為 ICD-10-CM 的惡性腫瘤編碼。
2.  **FDG-avid (Fluorodeoxyglucose-avid):** 這是一個影像學特徵，表明病變具有高代謝活性，通常與惡性腫瘤相關。雖然這不是一個獨立的診斷，但它是支持肺部異常發現為惡性的關鍵證據。
3.  **Chest Pain:** 患者因胸痛就診，但後續檢查排除了心臟、動脈瘤和胃腸道原因。因此，胸痛本身不是主要診斷，而是導致進一步檢查的原因。
4.  **Former Smoker:** 這是一個重要的風險因素，與肺癌相關。編碼為 Z87.89 (Other specified personal history of malignant neoplasm)。
5.  **Atrial Fibrillation (on Eliquis):** 患者有心房顫動病史，正在服用Eliquis。編碼為 I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)。
6.  **CAD s/p stent placement (Coronary Artery Disease s/p stent placement):** 患者有冠狀動脈疾病病史，並已放置支架。編碼為 I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。
7.  **BPH s/p TURP (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia s/p Transurethral Resection of the Prostate):** 患者有良性前列腺增生病史，並已進行經尿道前列腺切除術。編碼為 N40.1 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms)。
8.  **Non-exertional chest pain, musculoskeletal in nature, unresponsive to nitroglycerin:** 這是一個症狀，但已通過檢查排除了其他原因。編碼為 R07.89 (Other chest pain)。
9.  **Right thoracotomy, right upper lobectomy:** 這是手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
10. **Right pleural chest tube placement:** 這是手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
11. **Left PICC placement:** 這是手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
12. **Fiberoptic ENT exam:** 這是檢查程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
13. **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 這表示患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不編碼。
14. **Adverse effect of drugs (laxatives/opioids):** 這不是病歷中提到的內容，因此不編碼。
15. **Environmental factor of injury (unspecified place of occurrence):** 這不是病歷中提到的內容，因此不編碼。
16. **Aspirin allergy:** 這不是病歷中提到的內容，因此不編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Unintentional Overdose (Chief Complaint):** 患者因「非自願性過量服用」而就診，這是一個主要的就診原因。在 ICD-10 中，這通常會編碼為 T46.0X5A (Accidental (unintentional) poisoning by paracetamol, undetermined intent, initial encounter)。由於是「非自願性」，且「意圖未明」，因此選擇 T46.0X5A。
2.  **14,500 mg Tylenol ingestion:** 這明確指出了是對乙醯胺基酚 (Paracetamol) 的中毒。T46.0X5A 已經涵蓋了對乙醯胺基酚的中毒，因此不需要額外編碼。
3.  **Abdominal Pain:** 患者報告有「腹部疼痛」，這是中毒的症狀。在 ICD-10 中，這通常編碼為 R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified)。
4.  **Nausea:** 患者報告有「噁心」，這是中毒的症狀。在 ICD-10 中，這通常編碼為 R117 (Nausea)。
5.  **No Known Past Medical History:** 患者沒有已知的既往病史，因此不需要編碼任何慢性疾病。
6.  **Admitted for monitoring and NAC administration:** 這描述了就診的處理方式，而不是診斷或症狀，因此不需編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   T46.0X5A (Accidental (unintentional) poisoning by paracetamol, undetermined intent, initial encounter)

3.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p right UE PICC line placement and removal.** 這表示患者曾放置並移除右上肢 PICC 線，這是一個手術程序，但通常不作為主要診斷編碼，除非有併發症。
4.  **Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions.** 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼。
5.  **Adverse effect of drugs (IL-2 and Pembrolizumab):** 由於患者正在接受 IL-2 和 Pembrolizumab 治療，且這是入院的主要原因，因此需要編碼與這些藥物相關的不良事件。雖然病歷中沒有具體描述不良事件，但入院進行治療通常暗示存在需要管理的不良反應或副作用。因此，編碼 T46.1X5A (Adverse effect of interleukin-2, initial encounter) 和 T46.8X5A (Adverse effect of other antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter) 是合理的。

逐步推理：
1.  **HFrEF (EF 14%)**: 這是一個心臟衰竭的診斷，且射出分數低於 40%。I425 是心臟衰竭，未指明為急性或慢性，但由於患者有慢性病史，且本次就診是因症狀惡化，因此 I504 (慢性心臟衰竭伴急性失代償) 更為合適。
2.  **Atrial fibrillation (not on AC)**: 這是心房顫動，且未使用抗凝血劑。I489 是心房顫動，未指明為急性或慢性，但由於是慢性病史，I489 是合適的。
3.  **CKD (~Cr 4)**: 這是慢性腎臟病，肌酐值約為 4，表示腎功能嚴重受損。N185 是慢性腎臟病，第 4 期。
4.  **History of PEA arrest in setting of aspiration in ___**: 這是心臟驟停的病史，且與吸入性肺炎有關。I228 是心臟驟停，未指明原因，但由於與吸入性肺炎相關，I228 是合適的。
5.  **Recent admission ___ with hypoxia and tachypnea, and E coli UTI sepsis**: 這是近期的就診記錄，但目前是病史，不是本次就診的診斷。然而，E. coli 尿路感染和敗血症是導致本次就診的急性問題。
    *   **E coli UTI sepsis**: 這是敗血症，由大腸桿菌尿路感染引起。A415 是敗血症，由大腸桿菌引起。N390 是尿路感染，未指明部位。
6.  **Dyspnea and tachypnea**: 這是本次就診的主要主訴，是症狀。R060 是呼吸困難，R0612 是呼吸急促。
7.  **Bilateral pleural effusions**: 這是雙側胸腔積液。J90 是胸腔積液，未指明為急性或慢性。
8.  **Potential pneumonia**: 這是潛在的肺炎。J189 是肺炎，未指明病原體。
9.  **Aspiration risk**: 這是吞嚥困難的風險。R1310 是吞嚥困難。
10. **Speech and swallow evaluation**: 這是吞嚥困難的評估。Z7984 是吞嚥困難的長期 (慢性) 用藥或治療。

1.  **Chest pain and heaviness since 8pm last night, unrelenting and slightly worsening, not exertional, present at rest, same as prior MIs:** 這描述了心絞痛的特徵，特別是與既往心肌梗死相似。因此，I25.10 (Angina pectoris, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼。
2.  **Tachycardic and markedly hypertensive:** 這表示存在高血壓危象。I16.0 (Hypertensive crisis) 是一個合適的編碼。
3.  **Positive D-dimer, concern for PE:** 這表示存在肺栓塞的風險。R07.0 (Chest pain) 用於描述胸痛症狀，而 I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified) 用於肺栓塞本身。
4.  **Worsening chest pressure that became ___ in intensity, up-trending troponin, concern for aortic dissection:** 這表示存在主動脈剝離的風險。I71.0 (Aortic dissection, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼。

6.  **Creatinine 3.0 (up from 2.5 baseline):** 這表示腎功能不全。N18.6 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5) 是一個合適的編碼。
7.  **Prior MIs:** 這表示有心肌梗死的病史。I25.2 (Old myocardial infarction) 是一個合適的編碼。
8.  **Admitted to medicine for V/Q scan:** 這表示需要進一步的診斷檢查，但本身不是一個診斷。Z76.89 (Other specified health care factor influencing health status) 可以用於表示需要進一步的診斷檢查。

逐步推理：
1.  **TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) 作為主要手術：** 這是一個介入性心臟手術，用於治療嚴重主動脈瓣狹窄。雖然 ICD-10 沒有專門針對 TAVR 的 ICD-10 編碼，但其主要目的是治療主動脈瓣狹窄，因此主動脈瓣狹窄的診斷編碼是核心。
2.  **Severe aortic stenosis (嚴重主動脈瓣狹窄)：** 這是 TAVR 的主要原因，也是患者的主要慢性疾病。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 I35.0。
3.  **Dissection of L common femoral artery s/p bovine patch repair (左股總動脈剝離，已進行牛皮補片修復)：** 這是手術期間發生的併發症，導致患者需要血管外科手術修復。剝離本身是急性事件，對應 ICD-10 編碼 I71.4 (Acute arterial occlusion and embolism of other arteries)。修復手術 (bovine patch) 是治療措施，不作為診斷編碼。
4.  **Hypotension (低血壓)：** 這是術後轉送至 CCU 的主要原因，表示術後出現的急性症狀。對應 ICD-10 編碼 R05.9 (Hypotension, unspecified)。
5.  **pAF (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 間歇性心房顫動)：** 這是患者的慢性心臟疾病。對應 ICD-10 編碼 I48.0 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation)。
6.  **PE (pulmonary embolism, 肺栓塞)：** 這是患者的慢性心臟疾病。對應 ICD-10 編碼 I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified)。
7.  **Apixiban (阿哌沙班)：** 這是患者正在服用的抗凝血劑，用於預防血栓。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)。
8.  **Schizophrenia (精神分裂症)：** 這是患者的慢性精神疾病。對應 ICD-10 編碼 F20.9 (Schizophrenia, unspecified)。
9.  **Severe COPD on home oxygen (嚴重慢性阻塞性肺病，需居家氧氣治療)：** 這是患者的慢性呼吸系統疾病。對應 ICD-10 編碼 J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified)。氧氣治療是治療措施，不作為診斷編碼。
10. **Allergies: Penicillins / vancomycin / Cephalosporins (對青黴素、萬古黴素、頭孢菌素過敏)：** 這些是患者的藥物過敏史。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin), Z91.012 (Allergy to cephalosporin), Z91.019 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
11. **TAVR c/b dissection of L common femoral artery s/p bovine patch repair (TAVR 併發左股總動脈剝離，已進行牛皮補片修復)：** 這是一個術中併發症，表示在進行 TAVR 期間發生了股總動脈剝離，並進行了修復。這是一個重要的併發症，應編碼為 ICD-10 編碼 I71.4 (Acute arterial occlusion and embolism of other arteries) 來表示剝離，並使用 Z95.811 (Presence of other artificial heart valve) 來表示 TAVR 人工瓣膜的存在。

逐步推理：
1.  **Bilateral leg pain and swelling with drainage, redness, and inability to walk:** 這些症狀描述了雙腿的嚴重感染。由於患者有糖尿病史，且有創傷史（L膝關節化膿性關節炎和與植入物相關的併發症），最合理的診斷是糖尿病足部感染。由於有膿液排出，且患者無法行走，這表明是急性感染。因此，編碼為 **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic foot syndrome with ulceration and infection)**。
2.  **Large amounts of drainage from wounds on both legs:** 這進一步支持了糖尿病足部感染的診斷，並強調了潰瘍和感染的存在。
3.  **Subjective fevers and chills for the past year, more daily for the past month:** 這表明存在全身性感染。由於患者有糖尿病足部感染，這很可能是其引起的全身性感染。因此，編碼為 **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism)**。
4.  **Orthostatic symptoms, poor eating habits, chronic fatigue, naps frequently throughout the day:** 這些是慢性疾病的非特異性症狀，與糖尿病和其併發症相關，但不構成獨立的診斷編碼。
5.  **Chronic constipation, last BM was 6 days ago, saw ""a fair amount"" of blood come out:** 這描述了慢性便秘和便血。便血可能與便秘引起的肛裂或痔瘡有關。由於患者有糖尿病，痔瘡的風險增加。因此，編碼為 **K648 (Other hemorrhoids)** 和 **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified)**。
6.  **New substernal chest pain for the past few months, occurring almost daily, pressure, lasts 2.5 minutes, sometimes with exertion:** 這描述了心絞痛。患者有高血壓和糖尿病，這些都是冠狀動脈疾病的風險因素。因此，編碼為 **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)** 和 **R071 (Angina pectoris)**。
7.  **Chronic dyspnea on exertion that has progressively worsened over the last few years:** 這描述了呼吸困難。患者有肥胖史，這可能是導致呼吸困難的原因。因此，編碼為 **R0602 (Dyspnea on exertion)**。
8.  **Itchy bumps on his trunk and arms, unsure how long it's been present, thinks it may be from mites from parakeets he has:** 這描述了皮膚瘙癢和丘疹，可能與跳蚤或螨蟲感染有關。因此，編碼為 **L988 (Other specified skin diseases)**。
9.  **History of HTN (Hypertension):** 這是慢性疾病，編碼為 **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**。
10. **History of DMII (Type 2 diabetes mellitus):** 這是慢性疾病，編碼為 **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)**。
11. **History of L knee septic arthritis and group A streptococcal bacteremia in the setting of hardware related complications:** 這些是既往病史，但目前的感染是糖尿病足部感染，因此這些是相關的併發症，但不作為主要診斷。
12. **History of mild cognitive delay:** 這是慢性疾病，編碼為 **F79 (Unspecified intellectual disability)**。
13. **History of obesity:** 這是慢性疾病，編碼為 **E669 (Obesity, unspecified)**。
14. **History of parakeets:** 這不是疾病，而是導致皮膚症狀的潛在原因，不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: left arm weakness** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要進一步了解其病因。
2.  **History of Present Illness:***Neurology ED Code Stroke and Admission Note*** - 這是一個關鍵線索，表明患者因中風就診並入院。這直接指向中風的診斷。
3.  **Neurology ED Code Stroke and Admission Note** - 這句話明確指出患者因中風就診並入院，因此中風是主要的診斷。
4.  **Left arm weakness** - 這是中風的症狀，而不是獨立的診斷。在 ICD-10 中，症狀通常不單獨編碼，除非是主要診斷或需要進一步評估的症狀。
5.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions** - 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼相關的 ICD-10 編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   **I63.9** - 未特指的腦梗塞。這是最常見的中風類型，且病歷中未提供更詳細的資訊。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: CODE STROKE, left arm numbness**：患者因左臂麻木和癱瘓就醫，且病史中提到「These symptoms were reminiscent of her seizures.」，但後續描述更符合中風的症狀（如左臂麻木、無力、語言困難、面部麻木、頭暈等），且在就診時有低血糖，但症狀在補充葡萄糖後逐漸改善，這更支持中風而非癲癇發作。因此，最合理的診斷是中風。
2.  **History of Present Illness: ischemic stroke and small vessel disease**：病史明確提到「ischemic stroke」，這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼。
3.  **History of Present Illness: hydrocephalus of unknown etiology s/p VP shunt**：病史中提到「hydrocephalus of unknown etiology s/p VP shunt」，這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼。
4.  **History of Present Illness: epilepsy**：病史中提到「epilepsy」，這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼。
5.  **History of Present Illness: fluctuating left hand weakness and clumsiness at baseline**：基線狀態下左臂無力和笨拙，這是一個持續的症狀，應編碼。
6.  **History of Present Illness: fluctuating symptoms of left hand numbness, weakness, dysarthria and aphasia**：這些是癲癇發作的症狀，且病史中提到「focal seizures originating in the right parietal lobe with spread to the right frontal lobe」，這是一個重要的診斷，應編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Left hip pain**: 這是患者就診的主要症狀，且後續進行了左側全髖關節置換術。因此，應編碼為 M25.56 (Pain in left hip)。
2.  **Uncontrolled diabetes**: 這是患者的重要共病，且未受控。應編碼為 E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。
3.  **Left total hip arthroplasty**: 這是本次就診的主要手術。應編碼為 Z47.89 (Encounter for other specified surgical aftercare)。
4.  **Environmental allergies**: 這是患者的過敏史。應編碼為 Z88.2 (Allergy status to environmental agents)。

逐步推理：
1.  **N/V/D and abdominal pain x1 week**: 這些是主要的主訴和症狀。由於患者有胃食道逆流病史，且嘔吐和腹痛持續，且在嘔吐後仍持續，這指向胃食道逆流的惡化或併發症。因此，R1010 (Vomiting) 和 R1011 (Nausea) 是合理的。腹痛 R100 (Abdominal pain) 也應編碼。
2.  **Progressive n/v/d and inability to tolerate PO**: 這表明患者因症狀嚴重而無法進食，因此應編碼 R117 (Inability to tolerate food)。
3.  **Bowel irregularity since SBO one month ago**: 這表明患者有持續的腸道功能障礙，這與她的 SBO 病史相關。因此，K560 (Postoperative ileus) 是合理的，表示術後腸阻塞。
4.  **Passing gas and last BM was this AM, which was diarrhea and feels like she can't control her bowels**: 這描述了腹瀉和排便失禁。因此，K520 (Diarrhea) 和 R158 (Incontinence) 是合理的。
5.  **Hx of NSTEMI w/ PCI with DES to LAD c/b ISR with thrombus in LAD with repeat stent**: 這描述了心臟病史，包括心肌梗塞、支架植入和再狹窄。因此，I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 和 I252 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris) 是合理的。由於有支架植入，I2581 (Other forms of atherosclerotic heart disease) 也應編碼。
6.  **HTN**: 高血壓，編碼 I10。
7.  **HLD**: 高血脂，編碼 E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。
8.  **DM2**: 2型糖尿病，編碼 E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。
9.  **Obesity**: 肥胖，編碼 E669 (Obesity, unspecified)。
10. **SBO s/p ex-lap and lysis of adhesions**: 腸阻塞病史，編碼 K560 (Postoperative ileus)。
11. **Unstable angina**: 不穩定型心絞痛，編碼 I201 (Unstable angina pectoris)。
12. **Allergies**: 患者有多種藥物過敏史，應編碼 Z9101 (Allergy to penicillin), Z9102 (Allergy to erythromycin), Z9103 (Allergy to tetracycline), Z9104 (Allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics), Z9105 (Allergy to iodine), Z9106 (Allergy to simvastatin), Z9107 (Allergy to Percocet), Z9108 (Allergy to clindamycin), Z9109 (Allergy to bacitracin), Z9110 (Allergy to amlodipine), Z9111 (Allergy to Labetalol), Z9112 (Allergy to lisinopril), Z9113 (Allergy to pravastatin), Z9114 (Allergy to coconut), Z9115 (Allergy to corn), Z9116 (Allergy to imipramine), Z9117 (Allergy to doxazosin), Z9118 (Allergy to vancomycin), Z9119 (Allergy to metformin)。
13. **EGD**: 胃鏡檢查是診斷程序，不編碼為診斷。
14. **Adverse effect of drugs (laxatives/opioids)**: 患者因使用瀉藥和止痛藥導致腹瀉和嘔吐，這屬於藥物不良反應。因此，T474X5A (Adverse effect of laxatives) 是合理的。
15. **Environmental factor of injury (unspecified place of occurrence)**: 患者因腹瀉和嘔吐導致無法進食，這屬於環境因素。因此，Y92099 (Unspecified place of occurrence) 是合理的。

逐步推理：
1.  **Scheduled CT-guided Sacroplasty w/ ___**: 這是一個主要的診斷，因為它導致了入院。患者因計劃進行的骶骨成形術入院，但術中發現了右側骶前膿腫，這導致了術中和術後的處理。因此，主要診斷應為 ICD-10 編碼 M81.0 (骨質疏鬆性骨折，未特指部位)。然而，由於術中發現了膿腫，這是一個更緊迫的問題，需要立即處理，因此 M81.0 可能不是最優先的。但由於患者是為了骶骨成形術入院，且膿腫是術中發現，因此 M81.0 仍然是主要診斷。
2.  **Right presacral collection of air and debris concerning for abscess from rectal perforation and/or anastomosis disruption**: 這是術中發現的主要問題，導致了術中和術後的處理。這是一個膿腫，因此應編碼為 K66.8 (其他直腸疾病)。由於膿腫是術中發現，且需要引流，因此 K66.8 是主要診斷。
3.  **Metastatic colon cancer (s/p ostomy)**: 這是患者的既往病史，且是導致骶骨成形術的原因之一。因此，應編碼為 C18.9 (未特指的結腸癌) 和 Z85.061 (個人有結腸癌病史)。

6.  **Hyperlipidemia**: 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 E78.5 (高脂血症，未特指)。
7.  **CAD c/b MI s/p stent placement**: 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 I25.10 (冠狀動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病，無心絞痛) 和 I25.20 (心臟血管成形術後狀態，無心絞痛)。
8.  **Hypothyroidism**: 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 E03.9 (未特指的甲狀腺功能減退症)。
9.  **Necrotic rectum segment distal to the colorectal anastomosis**: 這是導致膿腫的潛在原因，應編碼為 K66.8 (其他直腸疾病)。
10. **Sacral insufficiency fractures**: 這是導致骶骨成形術的原因之一，應編碼為 M81.0 (骨質疏鬆性骨折，未特指部位)。
11. **Lipitor / Deodorized Tincture of Opium allergy**: 這是患者的過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (對他汀類藥物的過敏狀態) 和 Z91.018 (對其他藥物的過敏狀態)。
12. **CT-guided drain placement for pre-sacral abscess**: 這是術中進行的程序，應編碼為 Z48.818 (其他診斷性引流)。
13. **CT-guided drain upsize for pre-sacral abscess**: 這是術中進行的程序，應編碼為 Z48.818 (其他診斷性引流)。
14. **Moderate sedation**: 這是術中進行的程序，應編碼為 Z53.5 (麻醉和鎮靜)。

</think>

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: PV/SMV/Splenic vein thrombosis** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是導致其症狀（腹痛）的直接原因。因此，應編碼為 I81.10 (Portal vein thrombosis without obstruction)。儘管 CT 顯示血栓延伸至 SMV 和脾靜脈，但 I81.10 已涵蓋門靜脈血栓，且未提及阻塞，因此是首選。
2.  **History of Present Illness: HIV** - 患者有 HIV 病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。應編碼為 B20 (Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: Hepatitis B** - 患者有乙型肝炎病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。應編碼為 B18.1 (Chronic viral hepatitis B)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: Abdominal pain** - 患者主訴腹痛，這是其就診的直接原因。應編碼為 R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: Pain worsened over the course of 3 days, is crampy in nature, and has spread from the lower abdomen to the central abdomen and back. The pain was exacerbated with eating.** - 這些描述進一步說明了腹痛的性質和位置，但 R109 已涵蓋腹痛，因此不需要額外編碼。
6.  **History of Present Illness: CT abdomen on admission was notable for thrombosis of the portal vein extending to the SMV and splenic vein.** - 這再次強調了門靜脈血栓的存在，並延伸至 SMV 和脾靜脈。雖然 I81.10 已涵蓋門靜脈血栓，但為了更精確地描述血栓的範圍，可以考慮添加 I81.11 (Portal vein thrombosis with obstruction)。然而，I81.10 通常已足夠，除非有明確的阻塞證據。
7.  **History of Present Illness: He was started on systemic heparin.** - 這是一個治療措施，不是診斷，因此不需要編碼。
8.  **History of Present Illness: ___ was consulted and took the patient today for transjugular transhepatic placement of lysis catheter into the portal vein. He was intubated for the procedure with plans to return to ___ for lysis check and possible thrombectomy ___.** - 這些是治療程序，不是診斷，因此不需要編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   I81.10 (Portal vein thrombosis without obstruction) - 主要診斷，直接導致腹痛。
*   B20 (Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease) - 慢性病史。
*   B18.1 (Chronic viral hepatitis B) - 慢性病史。
*   R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified) - 主要症狀。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Pink-tinged emesis (Chief Complaint):**  This is the primary reason for the visit.  The patient vomited twice with pink-tinged vomitus, which is a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).  Since the patient denies melena or hematochezia, and the vomitus is pink-tinged, this suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding.  The most appropriate code for this is **K92.11** (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, upper gastrointestinal tract).
2.  **Nausea:**  The patient reports feeling nauseous during his cardiology appointment and continues to feel nauseous upon arrival to the floor.  This is a symptom that should be coded.  The appropriate code is **R11.0** (Nausea).
3.  **CAD s/p CABG last year:**  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a previous coronary artery bypass graft.  This is a chronic condition.  The appropriate code is **I25.10** (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris).
4.  **Child's A NASH/HBV cirrhosis with 3 cords of grade 1 varices:**  The patient has cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatitis B virus (HBV).  The cirrhosis is the primary diagnosis.  The appropriate code for cirrhosis of the liver is **K74.60** (Cirrhosis of liver, unspecified).  The underlying causes (NASH and HBV) should also be coded.  NASH is **K76.03** (Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)), and HBV is **B18.1** (Hepatitis B, chronic).
5.  **3 cords of grade 1 varices:**  The patient has esophageal varices, which are a complication of cirrhosis.  The appropriate code for esophageal varices is **K76.60** (Esophageal varices, unspecified).
6.  **DMII:**  The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The appropriate code is **E11.9** (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications).
7.  **Allergies: Lipitor / OxyContin / lisinopril:**  The patient has allergies to these medications.  The appropriate code for drug allergy is **Z91.011** (Allergy to statins), **Z91.012** (Allergy to opioids), and **Z91.018** (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances).

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但通常會有更具體的診斷。在病史中，患者被診斷為「closed loop small bowel obstruction」，這是一個更明確的診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: closed loop small bowel obstruction s/p exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection on ___** - 這是一個明確的診斷，且是患者此次就診的主要原因。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 K56.61 (Small intestinal obstruction, closed loop)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: multiple abdominal surgeries with recurrent small bowel obstructions** - 這表明患者有小腸梗阻的病史，且是本次就診的背景。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 K56.69 (Other small intestinal obstruction, not elsewhere classified)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: history of hypertension** - 這是患者的慢性病史。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: history of GERD** - 這是患者的慢性病史。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis)。
6.  **History of Present Illness: history of DM (diet controlled)** - 這是患者的慢性病史。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。
7.  **History of Present Illness: history of glaucoma** - 這是患者的慢性病史。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 H40.9 (Unspecified glaucoma)。
8.  **History of Present Illness: history of multiple abdominal surgeries** - 這表明患者有多次腹部手術史，這是一個重要的既往病史。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified surgical procedures)。
9.  **History of Present Illness: Allergies: nut / lactose / lisinopril / lidocaine** - 這些是患者的過敏史。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z91.011 (Allergy to nuts), Z91.012 (Allergy to lactose), Z91.013 (Allergy to lisinopril), Z91.014 (Allergy to lidocaine)。
10. **History of Present Illness: In the Emergency Department, the patient is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She reports some persistent pain and nausea. On exam, she is tender to palpation at the superior aspect of her midline incision without rebound or guarding.** - 這些是症狀，但主要的診斷已經是小腸梗阻，因此這些症狀通常不需要單獨編碼，除非是主要診斷的組成部分。

逐步推理：
1.  **Abdominal pain, worst pain ever had, crampy RLQ abdominal pain, associated with nausea, diarrhea, non-bilious emesis, significant fevers, chills, and malaise:** 這些症狀集合高度提示急性腹膜炎。最常見的急性腹膜炎原因是急性膽囊炎、急性胰腺炎或急性闌尾炎。由於病史中未提及膽囊或胰腺的具體症狀或既往病史，且疼痛位於右下腹，最合理的診斷是急性闌尾炎。因此，編碼為 K35.80 (Acute appendicitis, unspecified)。
2.  **CT-guided drainage of right lower quadrant and pelvic collections:** 這表明存在需要引流的腹腔內積液。這通常與急性闌尾炎的併發症（如膿腫）相關。因此，編碼為 K36.89 (Other specified complications of appendicitis)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: acute onset obtundation, likely seizures**：患者因急性意識模糊和疑似癲癇發作就醫。這指向癲癇發作，因此編碼 G40.909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus)。
2.  **History of Present Illness: presumed ""GTC""**：GTC (Generalized Tonic-Clonic seizure) 是一種癲癇發作類型，屬於癲癇的範疇，因此 G40.909 仍然適用。
3.  **History of Present Illness: NCHCT obtained with L frontal hypodensity thought to be ___ microvascular disease**：腦部 CT 顯示左額葉低密度病灶，被認為是微血管疾病。這指向腦梗塞，因此編碼 I63.9 (Cerebral infarction, unspecified)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: HTN**：高血壓是患者的既往病史，編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: HL**：HL (Hemorrhagic stroke) 是出血性中風，但病歷中未明確提及出血性中風的診斷，且 CT 顯示的是梗塞。因此，I63.9 仍為主要腦血管事件。
6.  **History of Present Illness: CSF**：CSF (Cerebral spinal fluid) 通常指腦脊液，但在此上下文中，更可能是指腦脊液減少症 (Cerebrospinal fluid leakage)。患者因癲癇發作和意識模糊就醫，且有腦部影像學異常，腦脊液減少症可能導致腦壓變化，進而引發癲癇。因此編碼 G97.0 (Cerebrospinal fluid leakage)。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Parasitic uterine fibroids (主要診斷)**: 這是一個複合診斷，包含子宮肌瘤和寄生性肌瘤。子宮肌瘤的 ICD-10 編碼是 D25.9 (Benign neoplasm of uterus, unspecified)。寄生性肌瘤 (parasitic fibroid) 是指肌瘤生長在子宮外，通常與子宮肌瘤相關，因此 D25.9 也涵蓋了這種情況。
2.  **Robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy in 2016 (病史)**: 這是一個過去的診斷，表示患者曾有子宮肌瘤切除手術史。這對當前的診斷 (D25.9) 有支持作用，但不是當前的診斷本身。
3.  **Biopsy of a right upper quadrant mass, consistent with a leiomyoma (病史)**: 這是一個過去的診斷，確認了右上腹腫塊是子宮肌瘤。這也支持了 D25.9 的診斷。
4.  **Pelvic ultrasound in 2017, showing a 9.5 cm anteverted uterus, 3.4 cm exophytic subserosal fibroid (病史)**: 這是一個過去的影像學檢查結果，進一步證實了子宮肌瘤的存在。
5.  **9.6 x 10.3 cm mass in the right lower abdomen above the right adnexa and abutting the liver (病史)**: 這是一個過去的影像學檢查結果，描述了右下腹腫塊的大小和位置，與寄生性肌瘤一致。
6.  **Opted for definitive surgical management via removal of her uterus (主要治療)**: 這表明患者選擇了子宮切除術作為治療方式，這與 D25.9 的診斷 (良性子宮腫瘤) 一致。
7.  **Concern that the parasitic fibroid may involve the liver (主要治療)**: 這表明寄生性肌瘤可能涉及肝臟，這是一個重要的臨床考慮，但並未明確診斷為肝臟受累。因此，不編碼肝臟受累的 ICD-10 編碼。
8.  **Allergies (過敏史)**: 
    *   Erythromycin Base: Z88.2 (Allergy to erythromycin)
    *   Wellbutrin: Z88.3 (Allergy to bupropion)

10. **History of osteoporosis (病史)**: M81.0 (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture)
11. **History of ataxia (病史)**: R27.0 (Ataxia)
12. **History of chronic anemia (病史)**: D50.9 (Anemia, unspecified)
13. **History of recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls (病史)**:

逐步推理：
1.  **C6 of EPOCH (EPOCH regimen)**: 這是一個化療方案，用於治療淋巴瘤。雖然 EPOCH 本身不是一個 ICD-10 編碼，但其目的是治療淋巴瘤，因此應編碼其目標疾病。
2.  **Richter Transformation to DLBCL**: 這是一個重要的診斷，表示慢性淋巴細胞白血病 (CLL) 已轉變為侵襲性淋巴瘤，即大B細胞淋巴瘤 (DLBCL)。這是一個主要的診斷，應編碼為 C8390 (其他未特指的非霍奇金淋巴瘤)。
3.  **History of CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia)**: 這是患者的基礎疾病，也是 Richter Transformation 的基礎。應編碼為 C9190 (其他未特指的慢性淋巴細胞白血病)。
4.  **Del(13q)**: 這是 CLL 的一個染色體異常，屬於 CLL 的一個亞型。應編碼為 Z8681 (慢性淋巴細胞白血病的染色體異常)。
5.  **Rai Stage I**: 這是 CLL 的分期，用於描述疾病的嚴重程度。應編碼為 Z8682 (慢性淋巴細胞白血病的Rai分期)。
6.  **Anemia**: 這是 CLL 的一個症狀，也是 Richter Transformation 的一個症狀。應編碼為 D649 (未特指的貧血)。
7.  **Thrombocytopenia**: 這是 CLL 的一個症狀，也是 Richter Transformation 的一個症狀。應編碼為 D696 (血小板減少症)。
8.  **Splenomegaly**: 這是 CLL 的一個症狀，也是 Richter Transformation 的一個症狀。應編碼為 R1610 (脾臟腫大)。
9.  **Extensive Adenopathy**: 這是 CLL 的一個症狀，也是 Richter Transformation 的一個症狀。應編碼為 R590 (淋巴結腫大)。
10. **PET suggestive of progressive CLL**: 這表明 CLL 有進展，應編碼為 Z8683 (慢性淋巴細胞白血病的進展)。
11. **Bone biopsy on ___ subsequently demonstrating Richter Transformation to DLBCL**: 這進一步確認了 Richter Transformation 的診斷，並強調了 DLBCL 的存在。
12. **Admitted for C6 of EPOCH pending donor search and re-establishment**: 這表明患者正在接受化療，並在等待骨髓移植。這是一個重要的治療狀態，應編碼為 Z5111 (化療)。
13. **POC Stripping ___**: 這是一個手術程序，用於骨髓移植前的準備。應編碼為 Z5181 (骨髓移植前的準備)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Altered mental status (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要進一步鑑別其根本原因。在病史中，MRI發現了左額葉的大型病變，這被認為是導致症狀的原因。因此，R41.81 (Other specified altered mental status) 可能是症狀的編碼，但更根本的原因是病變本身。
2.  **Large left frontal lesion (MRI finding):** 這是導致患者症狀的根本原因。病史中未明確說明病變的性質，但由於是神經外科會診並進行了腫瘤切除手術，最合理的假設是腦腫瘤。因此，C71.0 (Malignant neoplasm of frontal lobe of brain) 是最合適的編碼。
3.  **Forgetfulness, lightheaded, episodes of urinary incontinence, disheveled, half naked, disorganized home, inappropriate laughter, inability to manage finances:** 這些都是腦腫瘤引起的症狀和體徵。R41.81 (Other specified altered mental status) 可以涵蓋這些症狀，但由於有明確的病變存在，通常會優先編碼病變本身。
4.  **Diagnostic cerebral angiogram and Bifrontal craniotomy for tumor resection (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這些是診斷和治療程序，通常不編碼為診斷碼，除非有併發症或後遺症。病歷中未提及手術併發症，因此不需要額外編碼。
5.  **Healthy, no significant medical hx:** 這表明患者沒有其他重要的慢性疾病或共病，因此不需要編碼其他診斷。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   C71.0 (Malignant neoplasm of frontal lobe of brain) - 這是導致患者症狀的根本原因，也是進行手術的直接原因。
*   R41.81 (Other specified altered mental status) - 用於描述患者就診時的主訴和症狀集合，即使有明確的病變存在，也常會編碼以反映當前的臨床狀態。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pain radiating to arms & legs**: 這是主要的主訴，且描述為「sharp, constant」，並伴有「SOB with chest pain」。這符合急性冠狀動脈症候群（ACS）的表現，特別是考慮到患者有高血壓、吸食可卡因的病史，以及心肌肌鈣蛋白輕微升高（0.08）。因此，編碼 R07.0 (Chest pain) 和 I20.0 (Unstable angina pectoris) 是合理的。
2.  **HIV**: 患者有 HIV 病史，且是主要跟診的機構。編碼 B20 (Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease) 是必要的。
3.  **ESRD on HD**: 患者有終末期腎臟病，並在進行血液透析。編碼 N18.6 (End-stage renal disease) 和 Z99.2 (Dependence on renal dialysis) 是必要的。
4.  **Cocaine abuse**: 患者有可卡因濫用史，且在病史中提到「Endorses cocaine and marijuana use」。編碼 F14.20 (Cocaine abuse, uncomplicated) 是合理的。
5.  **Hypertension**: 患者有高血壓病史。編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是必要的。
6.  **Vomiting and diarrhea**: 患者有嘔吐和腹瀉。編碼 R11.10 (Vomiting, unspecified) 和 R19.7 (Diarrhea) 是合理的。
7.  **Dysuria**: 患者有排尿困難。編碼 R30.0 (Dysuria) 是合理的。
8.  **Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) allergy**: 患者對磺胺類抗生素過敏。編碼 Z91.013 (Allergy to sulfonamide) 是必要的。
9.  **ALT 42, AST 88**: 肝臟功能異常，但沒有明確的診斷。編碼 R94.1 (Abnormal liver function test results) 是合理的。
10. **Na 133, K 5.1, Cl 92, bicarb 22, BUN 36, Cr 7.9**: 這些是實驗室檢查結果，反映了患者的水電解質失衡和腎功能異常。編碼 E87.5 (Hyponatremia)、E87.6 (Hyperkalemia)、E87.8 (Other electrolyte disorders)、E87.6 (Hyperkalemia)、N18.6 (End-stage renal disease) 和 R99.2 (Abnormal creatinine) 是合理的。
11. **Trop 0.08**: 心肌肌鈣蛋白輕微升高，支持急性冠狀動脈症候群的診斷，特別是考慮到胸痛的表現。編碼 I20.0 (Unstable angina pectoris) 已經涵蓋了這一點。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: ""I need to go home""** - 這是一個症狀，但更常見的編碼是其後的診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: paranoid schizophrenia** - 這是患者的主要診斷，且是導致其當前行為和症狀的根本原因。對應 ICD-10 編碼 F20.0 (Paranoid schizophrenia)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: acute psychotic presentation** - 這描述了患者就診時的急性狀態，是其當前就醫的主要原因。對應 ICD-10 編碼 F31.9 (Unspecified psychotic disorder)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: previous been admitted to the psych hospital for psychosis 6 months ago** - 這表明患者有精神病史，且目前的急性發作是其病史的一部分。F20.0 已涵蓋了這種慢性病史。
5.  **History of Present Illness: ""I need to talk to the cops"" and ""I need to go to the hospital""** - 這些是患者主觀感受，但已包含在 F20.0 和 F31.9 的診斷中。
6.  **History of Present Illness: ""I was kidnapped, drugged, sexually assaulted, and put in a fake hospital""** - 這些是患者的精神病性妄想，屬於 F20.0 和 F31.9 的症狀範疇。
7.  **History of Present Illness: ""I was discharged from a children's hospital in ___ a ___ year old woman, how do you think that feels to be there?!""** - 這表明患者有對自身情況的扭曲認知，屬於 F20.0 和 F31.9 的症狀範疇。
8.  **History of Present Illness: ""I don't see people, but feels like people may be sexually assaulting her, and that something is unusual is happening at night.""** - 這些是患者的精神病性妄想，屬於 F20.0 和 F31.9 的症狀範疇。
9.  **History of Present Illness: ""She was observed yelling and uncooperative.""** - 這些是急性精神病發作的行為表現，屬於 F31.9 的症狀範疇。
10. **History of Present Illness: ""She denies recent changes to her sleep, appetite, energy, motivation.""** - 這表示患者目前沒有這些症狀，因此不需要編碼。
11. **History of Present Illness: ""She denies sx c/w hypomania/mania.""** - 這表示患者目前沒有躁狂症狀，因此不需要編碼躁狂症。
12. **History of Present Illness: ""She denies taking or needing medications.""** - 這表示患者目前沒有服藥，因此不需要編碼藥物依賴或戒斷。
13. **History of Present Illness: ""She denies having outpatient psychiatric treatment.""** - 這表示患者目前沒有接受門診精神科治療，因此不需要編碼。
14. **History of Present Illness: ""She denies SI/HI/AH/VH/paranoid ideation.""** - 這表示患者目前沒有自殺、傷害他人、自傷、自殺意念或偏執妄想，因此不需要編碼這些症狀。
15. **History of Present Illness: ""She denies recent substance use.""** - 這表示患者目前沒有物質濫用，因此不需要編碼。
16. **History of Present Illness: ""She reports living with her mother in ___ but she declined to tell me her mother's name or phone number or allow permission to speak with her.""** - 這是一個社會背景資訊，通常不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼，除非有特定的社會問題診斷。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   F20.0 (Paranoid schizophrenia) - 患者的主要診斷，也是導致其當前行為和症狀的根本原因。
*   F31.9 (Unspecified psychotic disorder) - 患者就診時的急性精神病發作狀態。

逐步推理：
1.  **lethargy, cough**: 這些是主要的主訴，但通常會被更明確的診斷所取代。
2.  **PMH metastatic colon cancer**: 這是一個重要的慢性病史，對症狀和治療有重大影響。對應 ICD-10 編碼 C18.9 (Malignant neoplasm of colon, unspecified) 和 Z85.061 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of colon)。
3.  **PMH ataxia**: 這是一個慢性神經系統疾病。對應 ICD-10 編碼 R27.0 (Ataxia)。
4.  **PMH recurrent history of aspiration pneumonia**: 這是一個重要的慢性病史，且本次就診的症狀（如咳嗽、低氧血症、胸片異常）與其相關。對應 ICD-10 編碼 J69.0 (Aspiration pneumonia)。
5.  **increasing lethargy**: 這是一個急性症狀，且在病歷中被描述為「change per the HCP」，表明是本次就診的主要原因之一。對應 ICD-10 編碼 R53.1 (Lethargy)。
6.  **cough x2-3 days**: 這是一個急性症狀，且與肺炎相關。對應 ICD-10 編碼 R05.9 (Unspecified cough)。
7.  **K 5.8 (hemolyzed)**: 這是一個實驗室異常，表明高血鉀。對應 ICD-10 編碼 E87.5 (Hyperkalemia)。
8.  **VBG w/pH 7.33, pCO2 59, lactate 2.2**: 這些是實驗室異常，表明存在代謝性酸中毒。對應 ICD-10 編碼 E87.2 (Metabolic acidosis)。
9.  **CXR w/low lung volumes, retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis vs. infection, small L pleural effusion**: 這些是影像學發現，表明存在肺部問題。由於病史中提到「aspiration pneumonia」，且胸片顯示「retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis vs. infection」，最合理的診斷是肺炎。對應 ICD-10 編碼 J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism)。
10. **Patient given: acetaminophen 1g IV, zosyn, vanc 1500mg, IVF**: 這些是治療措施，通常不直接對應 ICD-10 編碼，除非是用於編碼併發症或診斷。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: ""I'm here for sleep deprivation.""** 這表明患者的主要主訴是睡眠不足，這通常會導致疲勞。因此，F51.00 (Sleep deprivation) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness: ""history of post partum depression""** 這表明患者有產後抑鬱症的病史。F33.3 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, currently in partial remission) 是一個合適的編碼，因為它涵蓋了重複發作的重度抑鬱症，且目前處於部分緩解狀態。
3.  **History of Present Illness: ""history of bipolar disorder""** 這表明患者有雙相情感障礙的病史。F31.9 (Bipolar affective disorder, current episode unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼，因為它涵蓋了未指明當前發作類型的雙相情感障礙。
4.  **History of Present Illness: ""s/p at least several prior psychiatric hospitalization""** 這表明患者有精神病住院史。Z86.5 (Personal history of mental and behavioral disorder) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示個人有精神和行為障礙的病史。
5.  **History of Present Illness: ""medical history notable for OSA""** 這表明患者有阻塞性睡眠呼吸中止症的病史。G47.33 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)) 是一個合適的編碼。
6.  **History of Present Illness: ""feeling sad and having a 'complete breakdown' last week due to stress around the custody hearing with poor sleep, feeling exhausted.""** 這表明患者目前有情緒低落和疲勞的症狀，這與 F33.3 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, currently in partial remission) 一致，因為它描述了目前的症狀。
7.  **History of Present Illness: ""no known prior suicide attempts""** 這表明患者沒有自殺未遂史，因此不需要編碼。
8.  **History of Present Illness: ""abusive ex-husband"" and ""abusive ex-partner""** 這表明患者有家庭暴力的背景，這可能與她的心理狀態有關。Z60.4 (Problems related to other specified family circumstances) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示與其他指定家庭情況相關的問題。
9.  **History of Present Illness: ""could not afford a lawyer last week and that he lied to the court, saying she has a mental illness and so he was awarded custody of her youngest daughter""** 這表明患者有經濟困難和與法院相關的問題。Z59.5 (Problems related to lack of money) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示與缺乏資金相關的問題。Z63.8 (Other problems related to other specified family circumstances) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示與其他指定家庭情況相關的其他問題。
10. **History of Present Illness: ""feeling exhausted""** 這表明患者有疲勞的症狀。R53.83 (Other fatigue) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示其他類型的疲勞。
11. **History of Present Illness: ""poor sleep""** 這表明患者有睡眠障礙。R56.2 (Insomnia) 是一個合適的編碼，用於表示失眠。
12. **History of Present Illness: ""no known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions""** 這表明患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼。

4.  **also found to have hyperglycemia (glucose 471) consistent with a new diagnosis of diabetes** - 患者被診斷出患有糖尿病，且血糖值高達 471，這表明是 2 型糖尿病，且伴有高血糖危象。因此，應編碼 2 型糖尿病 (E11.9) 和高血糖 (R73.03)。
5.  **he landed on his buttocks which he's not sure relates to his pain or not** - 跌倒導致臀部著地，這是一個外傷事件，應編碼為臀部挫傷 (S30.810A)。
6.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Incision and drainage of perirectal abscess** - 這是一個手術程序，但對於 ICD-10 編碼，我們主要關注診斷而非手術本身。
7.  **Exam under anesthesia** - 這是一個麻醉程序，同樣不是診斷編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   K60.0 (Anal fissure)
*   K61.0 (Perirectal abscess)
*   E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)
*   R73.03 (Hyperglycemia)

逐步推理：
1.  **R distal humerus fracture (右肱骨遠端骨折):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，且已進行了 ORIF 手術。因此，最直接的診斷是骨折本身。由於是開放性骨折（ORIF 暗示需要手術治療），且未明確說明是開放性還是閉合性，但通常 ORIF 用於開放性骨折。因此，選擇 S42.301A (Closed fracture of right distal humerus, initial encounter for closed fracture) 會更保守，但若假設為開放性，則 S42.302A (Open fracture of right distal humerus, initial encounter for open fracture) 更為合適。然而，病歷中未明確說明是開放性，因此選擇 S42.301A。
2.  **Schizophrenia (精神分裂症):** 這是患者的既往病史，且在病歷中被提及。因此，應編碼 F20.9 (Schizophrenia, unspecified)。
3.  **HTN (高血壓):** 這是患者的既往病史，且在病歷中被提及。因此，應編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
4.  **Hydrochlorothiazide allergy (氫氯噻嗪過敏):** 這是患者的過敏史，應編碼 Z91.011 (Allergy to diuretics)。
5.  **Traumatic incident to his right arm (右臂受傷):** 這是導致骨折的外部原因，應編碼 Y93.09 (Other specified place of occurrence of external cause) 來表示浴缸是事故發生的場所。此外，還需要編碼 W19.0XXA (Unspecified fall from bathtub, initial encounter) 來表示跌倒導致的傷害。
6.  **Putting pressure on his right arm for approximately 1.5 hours (右臂施壓約1.5小時):** 這描述了導致骨折的機制，屬於外部原因的補充信息，通常不需要單獨編碼，除非有特定的 ICD-10 編碼對應。在此情況下，W19.0XXA 已涵蓋了跌倒導致的傷害，因此不需要額外編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Brain mass (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要進一步鑑別其性質。病史中明確指出是「left frontal anaplastic astrocytoma」，這是一個具體的腦部腫瘤診斷。
2.  **Left frontal anaplastic astrocytoma (History of Present Illness):** 這是一個明確的診斷，指左額葉的間變性星形細胞瘤。在 ICD-10 中，間變性星形細胞瘤的編碼是 C71.2 (Malignant neoplasm of frontal lobe of brain)。由於是「anaplastic」，表示惡性，因此 C71.2 是最合適的選擇。
3.  **First time seizure during sleep (History of Present Illness):** 這是一個重要的既往症狀，導致了腫瘤的發現。在 ICD-10 中，首次發作的癲癇發作通常編碼為 G40.909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus)。由於是「first time seizure」，且未提及為癲癇性發作，因此 G40.909 是最合適的選擇。
4.  **Seizure activity (History of Present Illness):** 患者「denies further seizure activity」，表示目前沒有進一步的癲癇發作，因此不需要編碼當前的癲癇發作。
5.  **Keppra (History of Present Illness):** 這是一個用藥資訊，不是診斷，因此不需要編碼。
6.  **Surveillance MRI shows progression of the lesion (History of Present Illness):** 這是一個影像學發現，表明腫瘤的進展，但這本身不是一個診斷，而是支持 C71.2 的證據。
7.  **Elective stereotactic brain biopsy (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個手術程序，不是診斷，因此不需要編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   C71.2 (Malignant neoplasm of frontal lobe of brain) - 左額葉間變性星形細胞瘤

</think>
<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pain (right sided, sudden onset, lasting 5 minutes, similar to prior infection, subsided, mild ongoing, more intense at PCP, subsided shortly after ED arrival):**  This is a presenting symptom. Since it's described as ""sudden onset"" and ""similar to a prior infection,"" it's likely a non-cardiac cause. However, the ECG showed ST depression in V1-V6, and labs showed elevated troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating myocardial ischemia. The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward, and a left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, and DES were performed. These findings strongly suggest an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with subsequent intervention. Therefore, the most appropriate code for the chest pain is R07.2 (Chest pain, unspecified) as a symptom, but the underlying diagnosis is more critical.
2.  **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST depression on ECG, elevated troponin-T and CK-MB, and subsequent PCI:**  This is a clear indication of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The presence of ST depression and elevated biomarkers, along with the intervention, points to a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The code I21.4 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction) is appropriate.
3.  **Coronary artery disease (CAD) s/p PCI in ___:**  This is a chronic condition. The code I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) is suitable for CAD without current angina.
4.  **Symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM:**  This indicates a history of bradycardia that required a pacemaker. The code I44.8 (Other specified arrhythmias) is appropriate for symptomatic bradycardia.
5.  **Pacemaker (PPM):**  The presence of a pacemaker is a device status. The code Z95.5 (Presence of cardiac pacemaker) is appropriate.
6.  **Pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions bilaterally on CXR:**  These are complications of the acute MI. The code R06.02 (Pulmonary edema) is appropriate for pulmonary edema. The code J90.8 (Other pleural effusion) is suitable for the pleural effusions.
7.  **Cardiomegaly on CXR:**  This is a finding on imaging. The code R09.2 (Cardiomegaly) is appropriate.
8.  **Dyspnea on exertion:**  This is a symptom. The code R06.02 (Dyspnea) is appropriate.
9.  **Dizziness:**  This is a symptom. The code R42.8 (Other dizziness) is appropriate.
10. **Loss of appetite:**  This is a symptom. The code R63.0 (Anorexia) is appropriate.
11. **Hypotension (SBP in the 100s, typically mid ___):**  This is a symptom. The code R05.0 (Hypotension) is appropriate.
12. **Allergies: Metoprolol / Atenolol / Lisinopril / triamterene-hydrochlorothiazid:**  These are drug allergies. The code Z88.0 (Allergy to beta-blocker) is appropriate for beta-blockers (Metoprolol, Atenolol). The code Z88.1 (Allergy to ACE inhibitor) is appropriate for Lisinopril. The code Z88.2 (Allergy to diuretic) is appropriate for triamterene-hydrochlorothiazid.
13. **Hypertension:**  This is a chronic condition. The code I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) is appropriate.
14. **Osteoporosis:**  This is a chronic condition. The code M81.0 (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture) is appropriate.
15. **History of fall:**  This is a past medical history. The code Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause) is appropriate for the unspecified place of occurrence of the fall.
16. **History of fracture:**  This is a past medical history. The code Z87.71 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) is appropriate for the personal history of other specified diseases and conditions.
17. **History of infection in the area (right sided chest pain):**  This is a past medical history. The code Z86.7 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) is appropriate for the personal history of other specified diseases and conditions.
18. **History of PCI:**  This is a past medical history. The code Z87.71 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) is appropriate for the personal history of other specified diseases and conditions.
19. **History of PPM:**  This is a past medical history. The code Z87.71 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) is appropriate for the personal history of other specified diseases and conditions.
20. **History of CAD:**  This is a past medical history. The code Z87.71 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) is appropriate for the personal history of other specified diseases and conditions.

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: syncope** - 患者主訴昏厥，這是本次就診的主要原因。在病史中，昏厥被描述為在酒精戒斷後的症狀，且在就診時有低血壓 (98/84) 和心率 16，這支持了昏厥的診斷。因此，R55.8 (Other specified syncope and collapse) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **hx of anxiety, depression** - 患者有焦慮和抑鬱的病史，這在病史中被明確提及。F41.9 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified) 和 F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) 是對這些慢性精神疾病的適當編碼。
3.  **EtOH dependence, 27 pack year smoking hx and recent dx of Stage IIIa RUL NSCLC** - 患者有酒精依賴史，這在病史中被明確提及。F10.20 (Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated) 是對酒精依賴的適當編碼。患者有27年的吸煙史，這是一個重要的風險因素，Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified tobacco use) 是對此的適當編碼。患者最近被診斷為IIIa期右上肺非小細胞肺癌，這是一個主要的診斷。C34.11 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, right lung) 是對肺癌的適當編碼。
4.  **In setting of EtOH relapse. Pt reports longest period of sobriety ___ years, until he started drinking again ___ year ago. He was in detox twice in the past year, most recently ___ at ___** - 患者在酒精戒斷後出現症狀，這表明酒精戒斷是導致昏厥的直接原因。F10.21 (Alcohol dependence with alcohol withdrawal syndrome) 是對酒精依賴伴酒精戒斷綜合徵的適當編碼。
5.  **He started drinking again on ___ and ___, consuming 1 liter of vodka. His last drink was ___, midnight (end of the day). He notes that, within 2 hours, he started withdrawing, with symptoms including ""racing"" sensation, inability to sit still, dry mouth. He went to ___ to pick up prescriptions on ___ morning at about 10 am, to fill rxs for Prozac and Xanax. When he walked into ___, he experienced increased anxiety ___ to being in public. He paced while waiting in the pharmacy line, theb began to feel lightheaded. The next thing he recalls is being loaded onto a stretcher. Denies tongue biting, incontinence. Has never had episodes like this before. Was told he was shaking, recalls being somewhat confused upon waking. Per ___ notes, EMS relayed that several people in line had seen some ""small shaking movements."" In the past, he has gotten the shakes when detoxing, but denies hx of DTs, alcoholic hallucinosis, or seizures.** - 患者在酒精戒斷後出現了多種戒斷症狀，包括心悸、坐立不安、口乾、暈眩、震顫、焦慮和意識模糊。這些症狀符合酒精戒斷綜合徵的診斷。F10.21 (Alcohol dependence with alcohol withdrawal syndrome) 已經涵蓋了這些症狀，因此不需要為每個症狀單獨編碼。
6.  **CT of facial bones revealed nasal bone fractures, nasal septum fractures and an air-fluid level in the frontal sinus s/o frontal sinus fracture. He had a 3cm laceration over his right eyebrow that was closed with interrupted prolene and then he was transferred to ___ ___ for further management of ""possible frontal sinus fracture.""** - 患者有面部骨頭骨折，包括鼻骨骨折、鼻中隔骨折和額竇骨折。S02.00XA (Unspecified nasal bone fracture, initial encounter) 是對鼻骨骨折的適當編碼。S02.10XA (Unspecified nasal septum fracture, initial encounter) 是對鼻中隔骨折的適當編碼。S02.81XA (Other specified fractures of facial bones, initial encounter) 是對其他面部骨頭骨折的適當編碼。患者有右眼眉上方3厘米的裂傷，這被縫合了。S01.01XA (Laceration without foreign body of eyelid and eyebrow, initial encounter) 是對此裂傷的適當編碼。額竇骨折被懷疑，但未明確診斷，因此使用 R99.81 (Unspecified abnormal finding on diagnostic imaging) 來表示影像學檢查中發現的未明確診斷的異常。
7.  **Received lorazepam 1 mg IV x1, and 1L D5LR** - 患者接受了 lorazepam 和 D5LR 治療，這表明他有低血壓和可能的脫水。R03.0 (Hypotension) 是對低血壓的適當編碼。E86.0 (Dehydration) 是對脫水的適當編碼。
8.  **Laceration sutured. Attempted to transfer to ___ for neurosurgical care, but apparently unable. Transferred to ___ for nsg evaluation.** - 患者有裂傷，這已經被編碼。轉院是為了神經外科評估，這表明有神經外科的關注，但未明確診斷，因此使用 Z87.898 (Other personal history) 來表示其他個人病史。
9.  **VS 97.7, 98, 124/84, 16, 100% RA** - 患者的體溫、血壓、心率和血氧飽和度在就診時是正常的，因此不需要編碼這些生命體徵。

逐步推理：
1.  **TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) with SDH (Subdural Hematoma):** 患者因跌倒導致頭部受傷，並在之前就診時發現右側硬腦膜下血腫 (SDH)。目前因「found down」再次就診，且神經外科認為需要升級照護，並懷疑有新的或惡化的腦內出血 (ICH)。這表明目前的 SDH 是主要的急性問題，且有惡化或新發的 ICH。因此，S80.0 (Subdural hematoma, initial encounter) 和 I62.81 (Intracerebral hemorrhage, initial encounter) 是主要的診斷。
2.  **History of SDH:** 患者有既往的 SDH 病史，這是一個重要的慢性病史。因此，S80.0 (Subdural hematoma, subsequent encounter) 用於表示既往的 SDH。
3.  **Hypertension:** 患者有高血壓病史，這是一個常見的慢性疾病。因此，I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是一個合理的診斷。
4.  **Dementia:** 患者有失智症病史，這是一個重要的慢性神經系統疾病。因此，G30.9 (Alzheimer's disease, unspecified) 是一個合理的診斷。
5.  **Depression:** 患者有抑鬱症病史，這是一個重要的慢性心理疾病。因此，F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) 是一個合理的診斷。
6.  **Dysphagia:** 患者有吞嚥困難病史，這是一個重要的慢性症狀。因此，R13.10 (Dysphagia, unspecified) 是一個合理的診斷。
7.  **Dysarthria:** 患者有語言障礙病史，這是一個重要的慢性症狀。因此，R47.89 (Other speech articulation disorders) 是一個合理的診斷。
8.  **Dizziness:** 患者有眩暈病史，這是一個重要的慢性症狀。因此，R42.10 (Vertigo, unspecified) 是一個合理的診斷。
9.  **Fall:** 患者因跌倒而就診，這是導致目前 SDH 恶化或新發 ICH 的直接原因。因此，W19.XXXA (Unspecified fall, initial encounter) 是一個合理的診斷。
10. **Place of occurrence of fall:** 患者跌倒的場所是浴室，這是一個重要的環境因素。因此，Y92.011 (Bathroom as the place of occurrence of the external cause) 是一個合理的診斷。
11. **Aspirin allergy:** 患者對阿司匹林過敏，這是一個重要的藥物過敏史。因此，Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin) 是一個合理的診斷。
12. **Penicillin allergy:** 患者對青黴素過敏，這是一個重要的藥物過敏史。因此，Z91.012 (Allergy to penicillin) 是一個合理的診斷。
13. **Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) allergy:** 患者對磺胺類抗生素過敏，這是一個重要的藥物過敏史。因此，Z91.013 (Allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics) 是一個合理的診斷。
14. **Adverse effect of anticoagulant:** 患者正在服用抗凝血劑 (Plavix, Coumadin, Lovenox)，並在就診時 INR 為 1.1，這表明抗凝血劑的使用可能導致了目前的 ICH。因此，T46.1X5A (Adverse effect of anticoagulants, initial encounter) 是一個合理的診斷。
15. **Reason for use of anticoagulant:** 患者服用抗凝血劑是為了預防血栓形成，這是一個重要的用藥原因。因此，Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants) 是一個合理的診斷。
16. **Other chronic conditions:** 患者有慢性貧血、骨質疏鬆症、高血壓、共濟失調、近期 L5 骨折等病史，但這些在本次就診中未被明確提及為導致目前症狀的原因，因此不作為主要診斷。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Scheduled Chemotherapy** - 這是一個就診原因，不是診斷，通常不編碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness:**
    *   **""resected stage IIIB (T3 N2a) colon cancer""** - 這是一個重要的診斷，表示患者有結腸癌病史，且已切除。根據 ICD-10，C18.6 代表結腸的惡性腫瘤，Z85.060 代表個人有結腸癌病史。
    *   **""adjuvant modified FOLFOX 6 with curative intent""** - 這表示患者正在接受化療，但這本身不是一個診斷，而是治療方式。
    *   **""infusion reaction at the start of cycle 5 ___s during day 15""** - 這是一個重要的事件，導致了後續的處理。根據 ICD-10，T36-T50 類別用於藥物、醫學製劑和生物製劑的不良反應。由於是對 oxaliplatin 的不良反應，且是首次發生，應編碼為 T36.0X5A (Adverse effect of oxaliplatin, initial encounter)。
    *   **""Allergy on ___ where skin prick testing revealed allergic sensitization to oxaliplatin (8 mm wheal/14 mm flare)""** - 這明確指出患者對 oxaliplatin 有過敏反應。根據 ICD-10，Z91.011 代表對化學藥物的過敏狀態。
    *   **""It was recommended to proceed with 3 bag desensitization for all subsequent chemo infusions.""** - 這是一個治療措施，不是診斷。
    *   **""Patient reports feeling fatigued.""** - 疲勞是症狀，編碼為 R53.83 (Other fatigue)。
    *   **""shortness of breath with exertion as well as productive cough.""** - 呼吸困難和咳嗽是症狀，編碼為 R06.02 (Dyspnea) 和 R05.2 (Productive cough)。
    *   **""SLE"" (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)** - 這是一個慢性疾病，編碼為 M32.9 (Systemic lupus erythematosus, unspecified)。
    *   **""remote history of nephrotic syndrome thought unrelated to SLE""** - 這是一個過去的診斷，且與 SLE 無關，編碼為 N03.9 (Nephrotic syndrome, unspecified)。
    *   **""hypertension""** - 高血壓是慢性疾病，編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
    *   **""GERD"" (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)** - 胃食道逆流是慢性疾病，編碼為 K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis)。
    *   **""productive cough""** - 已經編碼為 R05.2。
    *   **""denies pain""** - 患者否認疼痛，因此不需要編碼疼痛症狀。
    *   **""denies fevers/chills, night sweats, headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness/numbnesss, hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, hematochezia/melena, dysuria, hematuria, and new rashes.""** - 患者否認這些症狀，因此不需要編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   C18.6 (Colon, malignant neoplasm)
*   Z85.060 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of colon)
*   T36.0X5A (Adverse effect of oxaliplatin, initial encounter)

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: epigastric pain x1 day** - 這是主要的主訴，但需要根據後續診斷和檢查結果來確定其具體原因。
2.  **Hx of htn (Hypertension)** - 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 I10。
3.  **Hx of GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)** - 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 K21.9。
4.  **Hx of HLD (Hyperlipidemia)** - 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 E78.5。
5.  **Epigastric pain, nonpositional, radiating to his back, recurrent pain, extension of epigastric pain to chest** - 這些症狀描述與急性胰腺炎高度一致，特別是考慮到肝功能檢查結果（ALT/AST 417/298）和胰臟酶（lipase 27）升高，以及超音波檢查發現膽結石。因此，急性胰腺炎應編碼為 K85.00 (Acute pancreatitis, unspecified)。
6.  **Chest discomfort, nonradiating, nonexertional, without associated nausea or diaphoresis** - 這是急性胰腺炎的常見併發症，即胸痛，應編碼為 R07.89 (Other chest pain)。
7.  **Barium esophagram on ___ was unremarkable. Pt notes that this pain is different in both quality and intensity from his prior episodes of GERD.** - 這表明當前的腹痛不是由胃食道逆流引起的，因此 GERD 的編碼 (K21.9) 仍然適用於其既往病史。
8.  **RUQ u/s with gallstones without evidence of acute cholecystitis** - 這表明存在膽結石，但沒有急性膽囊炎的證據。因此，膽結石應編碼為 K80.20 (Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis)。
9.  **Hepatology consulted, recommended MRCP, hepatitis serologies, ___, AMA, ___, immunoglobulins, trend LFTs, consider inpatient hepatology consult if w/u unrevealing** - 這表明需要進一步評估肝臟狀況，但目前沒有明確的診斷。因此，肝臟檢查和評估的建議應編碼為 Z01.718 (Encounter for other specified special examinations and clinical tests)。
10. **Received GI cocktail, donnatal, lidocaine viscous** - 這些是治療措施，不直接對應 ICD-10 編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：

逐步推理：
1.  **Unneeded Ileostomy (主訴) / Ileostomy Takedown (主要手術)：** 這表示患者因不必要的回腸造口而就診，並進行了回腸造口拆除手術。這通常與回腸造口的併發症或功能障礙相關。最直接的編碼是 K66.6 (Other specified intestinal fistulas)，因為回腸造口本身是一種腸道瘻管，且其存在導致了需要拆除的問題。
2.  **Rectal Cancer (病史)：** 患者有直腸癌病史，這是回腸造口的原發原因。因此，需要編碼 Z85.06 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of rectum)。
3.  **Robotic LAR (病史)：** 患者曾接受過機械式低位前切除術 (LAR)，這是一種直腸癌的治療方式。雖然這不是當前就診的直接原因，但作為病史，應編碼 Z98.81 (Presence of other artificial openings) 來表示回腸造口的存在。
4.  **Allergies: ACE Inhibitors (過敏史)：** 患者對ACE抑制劑過敏，這是一個重要的臨床資訊，應編碼 Z91.012 (Allergy to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，且直腸檢查發現了陽性隱血。這指向消化道出血，特別是下消化道出血。因此，K62.5 (Hemorrhoids with bleeding) 是一個合理的選擇，因為患者有痔瘡病史，且痔瘡是導致BRBPR的常見原因。此外，R16.0 (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage) 也適用於描述消化道出血。
2.  **Hemorrhoids:** 患者有痔瘡病史，且最近一次結腸鏡檢查也發現了痔瘡。因此，K64.8 (Other hemorrhoids) 是必要的。
3.  **Anemia:** 患者有血紅蛋白下降的病史，且目前血紅蛋白為7.4，這表明存在貧血。D64.9 (Anemia, unspecified) 是一個合理的選擇。
4.  **Hypertension (HTN):** 患者有高血壓病史。I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是高血壓的標準編碼。
5.  **Endometrial cancer with oligometastasis to left lung:** 患者有子宮內膜癌病史，且有肺部轉移。C54.1 (Carcinoma of endometrium) 是子宮內膜癌的編碼。C78.5 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung) 是肺部轉移的編碼。
6.  **Recent ICU admission for PNA:** 患者最近因肺炎入院ICU。J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism) 是肺炎的編碼。Z86.16 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of respiratory system) 是肺部惡性腫瘤的個人病史。
7.  **Paroxysmal Afib started on coumadin:** 患者有陣發性心房顫動，並正在服用華法林。I48.0 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) 是心房顫動的編碼。Z79.01 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants) 是長期使用抗凝劑的編碼。
8.  **2L O2 requirement:** 患者需要2L氧氣。R09.02 (Hypoxia) 是低氧血症的編碼。
9.  **?hx dCHF (last TTE ___ with EF > 70% here) and was started on Lasix:** 患者有心力衰竭病史，並正在服用呋塞米。I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified) 是心力衰竭的編碼。
10. **Allergies: Omeprazole:** 患者對奧美拉唑過敏。Z91.013 (Allergy to proton pump inhibitor) 是對質子泵抑制劑過敏的編碼。
11. **Adverse effect of drugs (laxatives/opioids):** 患者因使用瀉藥和阿片類藥物導致腹瀉和惡心。T47.4X5A (Adverse effect of other laxatives) 是對其他瀉藥的不良反應。T47.2X5A (Adverse effect of other opioids) 是對其他阿片類藥物的不良反應。
12. **Environmental factor of injury (fall):** 患者有跌倒史。Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence) 是未指定發生地點的環境因素。
13. **Chronic abdominal pain at night:** 患者有慢性腹痛。R10.3 (Abdominal pain) 是腹痛的編碼。
14. **More tired for the past few weeks:** 患者有疲勞。R53.83 (Fatigue) 是疲勞的編碼。
15. **Chronic anemia:** 患者有慢性貧血。D64.9 (Anemia, unspecified) 已經涵蓋。

逐步推理：
1.  **polytrauma status post 90 mph MVC**: 這是一個多處創傷的狀態，由高車速的車禍引起。這應編碼為 S00-T88 (Injuries, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes) 系列中的一個或多個代碼，並加上 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause of injury) 來表示事故發生地點。
2.  **left lower extremity pain and neck pain**: 這些是症狀，但由於有明確的創傷診斷，通常不需要單獨編碼症狀。
3.  **left lower extremity pain**: 由於有明確的左股骨骨折診斷，這不是需要單獨編碼的症狀。
4.  **neck pain**: 由於有明確的頸部創傷診斷，這不是需要單獨編碼的症狀。
5.  **left lower extremity was initially pulseless upon presentation; pulses resumed with manipulation**: 這描述了左下肢的創傷，導致股骨骨折。因此，S72.00 (Fracture of shaft of left femur, initial encounter for closed fracture) 是適當的診斷。
6.  **L femur retrograde nail, L pilon ex-fix**: 這些是手術程序，不是診斷。
7.  **High speed MVC traveling at 90 mph.  Patient was wearing a seatbelt.  Unknown head strike and unknown loss of consciousness.**: 這提供了事故的詳細信息，並支持 S00-T88 系列的診斷。
8.  **GCS 15 and he medically stable**: 這表示患者在事故後意識清醒且穩定，不支持 S06 (Concussion and cranial contusion) 或其他意識障礙的診斷。
9.  **Allergies: Haldol**: 這是一個藥物過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to antipsychotic drugs)。
10. **Complaining of left lower extremity pain and neck pain.  He denied paresthesias in his extremities.  He denies chest abdominal pain.  He denies shortness of breath.**: 這些是患者主訴和否認症狀，通常不單獨編碼，除非有明確的診斷支持。

2.  **Angiogram of the left leg (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個診斷性檢查，用於評估下肢的血管情況。這通常與下肢缺血相關，因此應編碼為 I7080 (Unspecified peripheral arterial occlusive disease)。
3.  **Excisional debridement down to and including bone with wound vac placement, Left foot (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個治療性手術，用於處理足部潰瘍。這表明潰瘍已達到骨頭，因此應編碼為 L9711 (Ulcer of left foot with necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and bone)。
4.  **PICC line placement (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個治療性程序，通常用於輸液或給藥。這本身不是一個診斷，但可以作為一個程序性代碼。然而，ICD-10-CM 主要用於編碼診斷，因此除非特別要求，否則通常不編碼程序性代碼。
5.  **Allergies: metoclopramide:** 這是一個重要的患者資訊，應編碼為 Z91011 (Allergy to other drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
6.  **PMH: Hypertension:** 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
7.  **PMH: Hyperlipidemia:** 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Right thyroid nodule.** 這是一個主要的症狀，但通常在有明確診斷或手術指徵時，會優先使用更具體的診斷碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness: relatively large right-sided thyroid nodule measuring approximately 4.1 cm in diameter.** 這進一步描述了病變的大小和位置。
3.  **An ultrasound has revealed a hypervascular solid nodule.** 這提供了病變的性質：實質性、血管豐富。
4.  **Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy has been nondiagnostic on 2 occasions.** 這表明活檢結果不確定，無法明確診斷。
5.  **Because of the large size of the nodule, however, the patient has opted for a right hemithyroidectomy, mainly for diagnostic purposes to rule out malignancy.** 這明確指出手術是為了診斷，排除惡性腫瘤。這表明病變的性質尚不確定，但存在惡性可能，因此需要進行診斷性切除。

最合理的編碼集合：
*   **C73.3 (Malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland, unspecified):** 由於患者選擇進行診斷性切除以排除惡性腫瘤，且活檢結果不確定，C73.3 是最合適的編碼，表示需要排除惡性腫瘤的狀態。
*   **Z85.81 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland):** 患者有甲狀腺惡性腫瘤的個人病史，這是一個重要的既往病史。
*   **Z87.891 (Family history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland):** 患者有甲狀腺惡性腫瘤的家族史，這也是重要的風險因素。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chest and epigastric pain, sharp, continuous, worsened by deep breaths and positional changes, hypoxia in ED, fentanyl and IV dilaudid helped:** 這些症狀指向急性胸膜炎。R07.89 (Other acute pain in thorax) 用於描述急性胸痛，而 R07.0 (Acute pleurisy) 是更特定的急性胸膜炎診斷。由於疼痛與呼吸和體位變化相關，且使用了嗎啡類藥物緩解，R07.0 是最合適的選擇。
2.  **Abdominal fullness and distention, tenderness, nausea, vomiting, no gas since, small stool this am:** 這些症狀指向急性腸梗阻。K56.60 (Unspecified intestinal obstruction without perforation) 用於描述未指明的腸梗阻，且無穿孔。
3.  **Chronic pain with high dose home opioids:** 慢性疼痛是長期存在的問題，R52.9 (Unspecified pain) 用於描述未指明的疼痛。
4.  **BPH, recent UTI and urosepsis admission, scheduled for prostate surgery:** 前列腺增生是慢性疾病，N40.1 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms) 用於描述伴有下泌尿道症狀的良性前列腺增生。泌尿道感染和敗血症是近期的急性問題，但患者已出院，且目前的症狀與泌尿道問題無直接關聯，因此不編碼為主要診斷。然而，泌尿道問題的歷史和即將進行的前列腺手術表明存在泌尿道疾病，因此 N40.1 是合適的慢性診斷。
5.  **Lingering URI-type symptoms since admission in 2022, previously with green phlegm, now no sinus congestion, nasal discharge, sore throat:** 這些症狀指向急性上呼吸道感染。J00 (Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified) 用於描述未指明的急性上呼吸道感染。
6.  **Allergies: bee venom (honey bee) / vancomycin:** 過敏史應編碼。Z91.011 (Allergy to bee venom) 用於蜂毒過敏，Z91.012 (Allergy to vancomycin) 用於萬古黴素過敏。
7.  **Duodenal dilation for stricture on 2022-08-12:** 這是一個過去的診斷，目前沒有提及相關症狀或複發，因此不編碼為主要診斷。
8.  **Self-cathing 5x daily and has some spontaneous urination but with residuals:** 這表明存在排尿困難，是良性前列腺增生的症狀，已包含在 N40.1 中。

</think>

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Gastric mass (large gastric mass, 4 cm):**  This is the primary reason for the surgical procedure.  Since the biopsy results show ""gastric foveolar hyperplasia with associated cystic glands and lympho-plasmacytic infiltrate"" and ""no evidence of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma,"" it is a benign neoplasm.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is **D12.0** (Benign neoplasm of stomach).
2.  **Anemia (hemoglobin of approximately 7):**  The patient was anemic, and this is a significant symptom leading to further investigation.  The anemia is likely due to the gastric mass, which is causing chronic blood loss.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is **D63.0** (Iron deficiency anemia).
3.  **Iron infusions:**  This is a treatment for the anemia.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is **Z51.11** (Encounter for infusion therapy).
4.  **Large pedunculated cecal polyp:**  This is a separate finding from the gastric mass.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is **D12.3** (Benign neoplasm of cecum).
5.  **2 splenic flexure polyps:**  These are additional findings.  The appropriate ICD-10 code is **D12.4** (Benign neoplasm of transverse colon).
6.  **Laparoscopic converted to open resection of gastric mass:**  This is the major surgical procedure performed.  The appropriate ICD-10-PCS code is **0DBN0ZZ** (Laparoscopic resection of stomach, open approach).  This code captures the conversion from laparoscopic to open approach.
7.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:**  This is a general statement and does not require a specific ICD-10 code unless a specific allergy is documented.

逐步推理：
1.  **Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT):** 這是患者此次就診的主要主訴，也是入院的主要原因。因此，I47.1 (Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) 是主要診斷。
2.  **Aortic stenosis:** 患者有主動脈瓣狹窄的病史，且是TAVR/AVR評估的一部分。這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼。I35.0 (Aortic stenosis) 是最合適的。
3.  **CHF exacerbation (Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation):** 患者最近因心力衰竭惡化入院，且有4磅體重增加的證據。這是一個急性問題，應編碼。I50.22 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure) 是最合適的，因為它表示慢性心力衰竭的急性惡化。
4.  **Coronary angiogram and right heart catheterization:** 這些是診斷程序，不是診斷本身，因此不需要編碼。
5.  **TAVR/AVR workup:** 這是一個評估過程，不是診斷，因此不需要編碼。

</think>
<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Shortness of breath and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure:** 這是一個主要的症狀和診斷。由於是急性發作，且有慢性心力衰竭的背景，應編碼 I5024 (Acute on chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure)。
2.  **Severe AS with a TAVR workup one year ago, found not to meet criteria at that time:** 這表明患者有嚴重的主動脈瓣狹窄，且曾評估過經導管主動脈瓣置換術 (TAVR)。目前的症狀和心力衰竭可能與此相關。因此，主動脈瓣狹窄應編碼 I350 (Aortic valve (stenosis) (narrowing))。
3.  **Severe AS with mean gradient of 34 mmHg increased to 42 mm Hg with 10 mcg of dobutamine:** 這進一步證實了主動脈瓣狹窄的嚴重性，並支持 I350 的編碼。
4.  **elevated filling pressures and depressed cardiac index:** 這些是心力衰竭的客觀證據，支持 I5024 的編碼。
5.  **PMH significant for CAD s/p BMS in ___:** 患者有冠狀動脈疾病史，且曾植入支架。這應編碼 I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。
6.  **CAD s/p BMS in ___:** 這表明患者有冠狀動脈支架植入史，應編碼 Z955 (Presence of coronary atherectomy device)。
7.  **PMH significant for AFIB/flutter not on anticoagulation:** 患者有心房顫動/心房顫動史，且未使用抗凝血劑。這應編碼 I489 (Other specified cardiac arrhythmias)。
8.  **CKD Stage III:** 患者有第三期慢性腎臟病。這應編碼 N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3)。
9.  **Hypertension:** 患者有高血壓病史。這應編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
10. **GI bleed one year ago:** 患者有胃腸道出血史。這應編碼 K620 (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, unspecified)。
11. **TAVR s/p ___ 3 TAVR:** 患者曾接受過 TAVR 手術。這應編碼 Z9581 (Presence of other artificial heart valve)。
12. **PACEMAKER IMPLANT: Dual chamber ___ (BSc) DDD 60-120 implanted via left cephalic vein:** 患者有植入式心臟起搏器。這應編碼 Z9580 (Presence of other artificial cardiac pacemaker)。
13. **Troponin elevated to 0.073:** 肌鈣蛋白升高是心肌損傷的指標，支持心力衰竭的診斷，但通常不單獨編碼，除非有心肌梗死的明確診斷。
14. **BNP was elevated at 7000:** BNP 升高是心力衰竭的客觀證據，支持 I5024 的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Stage IV lung cancer (stage IV lung cancer):** ICD-10 編碼 C34.90 (Malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of bronchus and lung, without pleural effusion)。雖然病歷中提到有胸腔積液，但 C34.90 本身已涵蓋了沒有胸腔積液的肺癌，且病歷中未明確指出肺癌是導致胸腔積液的原因。
2.  **HFrEF (LVEF ___):** ICD-10 編碼 I50.22 (Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction)。病歷中明確提到 HFrEF (左心室射血分數降低的心力衰竭)。
3.  **CKD III:** ICD-10 編碼 N18.5 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3)。病歷中明確提到 CKD III。
4.  **Atrial fibrillation on Rivaroxaban:** ICD-10 編碼 I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)。病歷中明確提到心房顫動。
5.  **Pericardial effusion (Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness):** ICD-10 編碼 I30.0 (Pericardial effusion)。這是本次就診的主要原因。
6.  **Bilateral pleural effusions (History of Present Illness):** ICD-10 編碼 J90.8 (Other pleural effusion)。病歷中明確提到雙側胸腔積液。
7.  **Hypertensive to 195/07 (History of Present Illness):** ICD-10 編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。病歷中提到高血壓。
8.  **Adverse effect of drugs (Rivaroxaban):** ICD-10 編碼 T46.1X5A (Adverse effect of anticoagulants, initial encounter)。病歷中提到患者正在服用 Rivaroxaban，且有胸腔積液和胸腔引流，這可能與抗凝血藥物的使用有關。
9.  **Refusing medications, including torsemide in her nursing home (History of Present Illness):** ICD-10 編碼 Z91.11 (Noncompliance with drug therapy)。病歷中提到患者拒絕服藥，包括利尿劑。

逐步推理：
1.  **DM complicated by peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy**: 患者有糖尿病，並伴有周邊神經病變和視網膜病變。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 E11.62 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy)。
2.  **Bilateral metatarsal osteomyelitis s/p amputation**: 患者有雙側跖骨骨髓炎，並已進行截肢。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 M86.12 (Osteomyelitis of left foot) 和 M86.11 (Osteomyelitis of right foot)。由於是慢性骨髓炎，且有截肢史，應使用 M86.12 和 M86.11。
3.  **Aflutter s/p ablation on coumadin**: 患者有心房顫動，已進行導管消融術，並服用華法林。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation) 和 Z86.71 (Personal history of other cardiac surgical procedure)。
4.  **Dilated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 40-45%)**: 患者有擴張型心肌病，左心室射出分數 40-45%。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I42.0 (Dilated cardiomyopathy)。
5.  **Toe Pain**: 患者主訴腳趾疼痛。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 R20.2 (Pain in toe)。
6.  **Bradycardia**: 患者主訴心搏過緩。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 R00.0 (Bradycardia)。
7.  **L great toe infection**: 患者有左大腳趾感染。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 L03.111 (Cellulitis of left foot)。
8.  **Discontinued his antibiotic four days ago due to ongoing diarrhea**: 患者因持續腹瀉而停用抗生素。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 K52.81 (Other specified functional gastrointestinal disorders)。
9.  **Bigeminy**: 患者有二聯律。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 I44.8 (Other specified cardiac arrhythmias)。
10. **Retrocardiac streaky opacity likely atelectasis**: 患者有肺部不張。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 J98.81 (Other specified atelectasis)。
11. **Severe degenerative changes of the first MTP joint**: 患者有第一跖趾關節嚴重退化性變化。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 M17.1 (Osteoarthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joint)。
12. **L foot radiograph demonstrated no definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis**: 患者左腳 X 光檢查未發現骨髓炎的明確證據。這表示目前沒有活動性骨髓炎，因此不編碼 M86.12。
13. **IV Vanc and Flagyl in addition to Cipro**: 患者接受了靜脈注射的萬古黴素、甲硝唑和環丙沙星。這表示正在進行抗生素治療，但這些是治療措施，不是診斷。
14. **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions**: 患者無已知過敏史或不良藥物反應。這表示不需要編碼 Z91.010 等過敏相關代碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Altered Mental Status (AMS):** 患者表現出意識狀態改變，包括在黑暗中坐著並告訴家人她需要去透析（儘管已經完成透析），以及在夜間醒來使用廁所時開始洗澡並告訴丈夫她要去上班。這些行為異常表明存在意識混亂。因此，R41.81 (Disorientation) 是一個合適的編碼。
2.  **Weakness:** 患者報告有虛弱感，且丈夫提到她有幾次不穩定並需要協助到車上。這表明存在虛弱症狀。因此，R53.1 (Weakness) 是一個合適的編碼。
3.  **Dysuria x 2 days:** 患者因尿路感染 (UTI) 有2天的排尿困難。這是一個症狀，因此，N39.0 (Dysuria) 是一個合適的編碼。
4.  **UTI treated with Bactrim:** 患者因尿路感染被給予Bactrim，且症狀有所緩解。這表明存在尿路感染。因此，N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified) 是一個合適的編碼。
5.  **ESRD on HD T/ThSa:** 患者有終末期腎臟病，並在週三、週五、週日進行血液透析。這是一個慢性疾病。因此，N18.6 (End-stage renal disease) 是一個合適的編碼。
6.  **Schizophrenia:** 患者有精神分裂症病史。這是一個慢性精神疾病。因此，F20.9 (Schizophrenia, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼。
7.  **Allergies:** 患者有多種藥物過敏史，包括Haldol、Klonopin、Ativan、Risperdal、Zyprexa、Seroquel、Penicillins、Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)、Chlorpromazine、Trifluoperazine。這些過敏史應被編碼。因此，Z91.011 (Allergy to antipsychotic drugs), Z91.012 (Allergy to anxiolytic drugs), Z91.013 (Allergy to anticonvulsants), Z91.014 (Allergy to antibiotics), Z91.015 (Allergy to sulfonamide drugs) 是合適的編碼。
8.  **Hypotension (104/52):** 患者的收縮壓為104，舒張壓為52，這表明低血壓。因此，R03.0 (Hypotension) 是一個合適的編碼。
9.  **Fever (100.8):** 患者的體溫為100.8°F，這表明發燒。因此，R50.9 (Fever, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼。
10. **Tachycardia (102):** 患者的心跳為102次/分鐘，這表明心跳過速。因此，R00.2 (Tachycardia) 是一個合適的編碼。
11. **Tachypnea (18):** 患者的呼吸頻率為18次/分鐘，這表明呼吸急促。因此，R06.02 (Tachypnea) 是一個合適的編碼。
12. **Hypoxemia (97% RA):** 患者的血氧飽和度為97%，這表明輕度低氧血症。因此，R09.02 (Hypoxemia) 是一個合適的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Abnormal labs** - 這是一個症狀，但會在具體的實驗室結果中得到更明確的診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Metastatic NSCLC to the scalp s/p four cycles carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab, then three cycles maintenance pemetrexed (___) with mixed tumor response** - 這明確指出患者有非小細胞肺癌 (NSCLC) 且已轉移至頭皮，且正在接受化療。因此，應編碼惡性腫瘤的 ICD-10 編碼。
    *   C34.90: Malignant neoplasm of unspecified larynx (喉部未特指的惡性腫瘤) - 由於病歷中未明確指出肺癌的原發部位，但通常 NSCLC 指的是肺部，因此 C34.90 是最合適的選擇。
    *   C79.89: Secondary malignant neoplasm of other specified sites (其他特指部位的繼發性惡性腫瘤) - 由於頭皮是轉移部位，因此需要編碼繼發性惡性腫瘤。
3.  **History of Present Illness: COPD** - 慢性阻塞性肺病是患者的既往病史，應編碼。
    *   J44.9: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified (未特指的慢性阻塞性肺病)
4.  **History of Present Illness: recent admission for checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis now on 3L NC** - 患者最近因檢查點抑制劑引起的肺炎入院，目前仍在使用鼻導管吸氧。這是一個重要的診斷。

    *   R09.02: Other specified adverse effect of other drugs, medicaments and biological substances (其他特指的其他藥物、藥劑和生物物質的不良反應) - 用於表示檢查點抑制劑 (pembrolizumab) 的不良反應。
    *   R09.01: Adverse effect of other drugs, medicaments and biological substances, unspecified (其他藥物、藥劑和生物物質的不良反應，未特指) - 作為 R09.02 的補充，表示未特指的不良反應。
    *   Z99.11: Dependence on oxygen (氧氣依賴)
5.  **History of Present Illness: elevated AST to >1400 on routine labs (from normal baseline 1 week ago)** - 患者出現嚴重的肝功能異常，AST 明顯升高。這是一個重要的急性診斷。
    *   R74.0: Elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (血清天門冬氨酸氨基轉移酶升高)
6.  **History of Present Illness: Allergies: Bactrim** - 患者對 Bactrim (一種抗生素) 有過敏史。

Also denies IV drug use, history of hepatitis/HIV, incarceration or significant time spent abroad. No new medications except those prescribed at his discharge. Also denies any personal/family history of liver disease or autoimmune disease.** - 這些資訊排除了其他可能的肝功能異常原因，如肝炎、自身免疫性肝病、酒精性肝病、藥物性肝損傷等。因此，肝功能異常 (R74.0) 是主要的診斷，而其他潛在原因 (如酒精性肝病、藥物性肝損傷) 不需要編碼，除非有明確的證據支持。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Abdominal pain/Jaundice (Chief Complaint):** 這些是症狀，但通常在有明確診斷的情況下，症狀碼會被診斷碼取代。然而，如果症狀是就診的主要原因且診斷尚未明確，則可能需要編碼。在本例中，患者被診斷為膽囊結石和膽囊炎，因此這些症狀碼可能不是最優先的。
2.  **Laparoscopic, converted to open cholecystectomy (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這表明患者接受了膽囊切除術，這通常是由膽囊疾病引起的。因此，我們需要編碼導致手術的膽囊疾病。
3.  **Cholelithiasis (Biliary Calculus):** 這是膽囊結石，是膽囊炎的常見原因，也是膽囊切除術的常見指征。因此，K80.00 (Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis) 是一個合理的編碼。
4.  **Cholecystitis (Biliary Calculus):** 這是膽囊炎，通常與膽囊結石相關。K81.00 (Acute cholecystitis without calculus) 是一個合理的編碼，表示急性膽囊炎，但未提及結石。然而，由於患者有膽囊結石，且膽囊炎通常由結石引起，K80.00 (Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis) 和 K81.00 (Acute cholecystitis without calculus) 可能會被認為是不完整的。更精確的編碼可能是 K80.01 (Cholelithiasis with cholecystitis) 來表示膽囊結石伴膽囊炎。
5.  **Strawberry Allergy:** 這是一個過敏史。Z91.011 (Allergy to food, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: ""Just depressed""**：患者主訴是「只是抑鬱」，這直接指向抑鬱症狀。在 ICD-10 中，F32.9 是「未特定的輕度抑鬱發作」，適用於有抑鬱症狀但未明確診斷為重度或有其他特定特徵的情況。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Per Dr. ___ ___ ED Initial Psychiatry Consult**：雖然沒有詳細描述，但「Initial Psychiatry Consult」通常表示患者因心理問題就診，且「Just depressed」是主要症狀。因此，F32.9 是最合理的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Biliary Colic (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴膽囊痛，且病史中明確提到「symptomatic cholelithiasis」，並有超音波檢查結果支持。因此，K80.20 (Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis) 是最合適的診斷碼。

8.  **Post-Prandial RUQ Pain Radiating to RUQ:** 患者描述了進食後右上腹痛放射至右上腹，這支持膽囊結石的診斷，並已包含在 K80.20 中。
9.  **Loose Stools:** 患者有腹瀉症狀，這可能是腸躁症 (K58.9) 的表現，也可能與膽囊結石 (K80.20) 有關，但 K58.9 已涵蓋腸躁症的腹瀉。
10. **Nausea, Decreased Appetite:** 這些是膽囊結石 (K80.20) 的常見症狀，不需單獨編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **flank pain, hematuria**: 這是患者就診的主要症狀。由於病史中提到尿液檢查陽性，且尿液培養出大腸桿菌，這表明存在泌尿道感染。因此，這些症狀應被編碼為泌尿道感染的表現，而非單獨的症狀。
2.  **history of sickle cell**: 患者有 sickle cell 病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 D57.0 (Sickle-cell anemia)。
3.  **presented to ___ ER on ___ with left flank pain. Pain started earlier that day, came on relatively suddenly. Of note, patient presented to ER about 2 weeks ago with hematuria and right back pain. Her UA was positive, and she was sent home with 1 week course of antibiotics. No imaging was done at that ER visit, her urine culture grew E Coli. Her symptoms improved after the antibiotics.**:
    *   這段描述明確指出患者在兩週前因血尿和右側背部疼痛就醫，尿液檢查陽性，尿液培養出大腸桿菌，並接受了抗生素治療，症狀改善。這表明患者目前的泌尿道感染是之前感染的復發或持續。
    *   由於患者目前就診是因為左側腰痛，而兩週前的右側背部疼痛和血尿是同一個泌尿道感染的表現，且尿液培養出大腸桿菌，這表明目前的症狀是同一個泌尿道感染的持續或復發。
    *   因此，最合理的診斷是泌尿道感染，且為復發性，應編碼為 N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified, recurrent)。
    *   由於尿液培養出大腸桿菌，應編碼出病原體，即 B96.20 (Escherichia coli (E. coli) as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere)。
4.  **No imaging was done at that ER visit**: 這表明在兩週前的就診中，未進行影像學檢查，因此目前的泌尿道感染未明確指出是上泌尿道（腎臟或輸尿管）或下泌尿道（膀胱或尿道）感染。因此，使用 N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified) 是合理的。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   D57.0 (Sickle-cell anemia)
*   N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified, recurrent)
*   B96.20 (Escherichia coli (E. coli) as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere)

逐步推理：
1.  **Chasing geese, they thought that exhibited odd behavior**: 這描述了患者在公共場所的異常行為，包括抓鴨子並試圖將其放入包中，以及後來的自閉行為（鎖門、拒絕開門）。這些行為表明存在精神疾病導致的異常行為。最符合的診斷是 F63.9 (Other specified personality disorders)。雖然 F63.0 (Paranoid personality disorder) 也涉及不信任，但患者的主要表現是異常行為，而非持續的不信任和猜疑。
2.  **PPHx of ADHD**: 患者有注意力缺陷多動障礙的病史，且描述了「困難專注」和「難以完成事情」，這符合 ADHD 的症狀。因此，F90.9 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified) 是適當的編碼。
3.  **PPHx of OCD with prior psychiatric hospitalization in ___ at ___ for intrusive homicidal thoughts with plan to kill former boss, with one episode of cutting in the past**: 患者有強迫症的病史，並有侵入性的殺人意念，雖然目前否認，但這表明存在強迫症的持續影響。因此，F42 (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) 是適當的編碼。
4.  **Semester-long feelings of sadness about spending large amounts of money on tuition and being unable to do well in school. He has been struggling academically, with difficulties focusing and trouble finishing things on time, overthinking assignments and running out of time. Has been sleeping well (between ___ AM and ___ AM), but has been feeling tired, often going back to bed in the morning. Appetite is good. Continues to enjoy friends' company and watching youtube videos. However, he reports feeling ""useless, helpless"" due to his academic difficulties. ""Sometimes I fantasize of my heart just stopping"" due to ___ of satisfaction in life, but ""I keep going because I know it's gonna get better"". He describes that he fantasizes about jumping out of the window, but reports having ""things that are keeping me here"" such as ""hurting my family, my religion (it's a sin to kill yourself), that ""other people would miss me and I would disappoint them"" and does not want his upbringing and his parents' investment in him to be ""meaningless"".**: 這些描述表明患者存在持續的悲傷、無用感、無助感、對死亡的幻想，以及對生活缺乏滿意度，這些都是重度抑鬱症的症狀。因此，F33.2 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, single episode) 是適當的編碼。
5.  **Denies any current suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Reports chronic history of homicidal thoughts about ""people who have wronged me"" (""these thoughts haunt me sometimes"") but denies intent or plan. Describes doing CBT during his therapy appointments to lessen these thoughts. Has fantasies ""about verbal fights""**: 患者有持續的殺人意念，但否認當前意圖或計畫。這符合 F60.3 (Paranoid disorder) 的診斷，即對他人懷有不信任和猜疑，並伴有妄想。
6.  **He reports feeling ""nervous like I did something terrible, but I don't think I did something terrible"". He feels that today's events were blown out of proportion.**: 患者對事件的反應表明存在焦慮，這可以歸類為 F41.9 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Bile Duct Obstruction due to pancreatic mass (主訴):** 這是患者就診的主要原因。膽管阻塞是症狀，而胰腺腫瘤是原因。因此，應編碼膽管阻塞 (K83.5) 和胰腺腫瘤 (C25.9)。
2.  **New pancreatic mass (病史):** 這明確指出是胰腺腫瘤，且未指定類型，因此使用 C25.9 (胰頭部未特指的胰腺癌)。
3.  **Nausea/vomiting (病史):** 恶心和嘔吐是症狀，應編碼 R11.0 (嘔吐) 和 R11.1 (惡心)。
4.  **Dark urine (病史):** 黑尿是症狀，應編碼 R82.0 (尿液顏色異常)。
5.  **Dark black emesis (病史):** 黑色嘔吐物是症狀，應編碼 R11.1 (惡心) 和 R11.2 (嘔吐物異常)。
6.  **Increasing fatigue (病史):** 疲勞是症狀，應編碼 R53.83 (其他疲勞)。
7.  **Sleeping more than usual (病史):** 睡眠過多是症狀，應編碼 R56.0 (嗜睡)。
8.  **Subjective fevers and chills (病史):** 主觀發燒和寒戰是症狀，應編碼 R50.9 (發燒，未特指) 和 R53.1 (寒戰)。
9.  **Leukocytosis to 15 (病史):** 白血球增多是實驗室檢查結果，應編碼 D72.89 (其他白血球增多)。
10. **Transaminitis consistent with a biliary obstruction (病史):** 转氨酶升高是實驗室檢查結果，應編碼 R94.1 (肝功能檢查異常)。
11. **Sludge in the gallbladder (病史):** 膽囊泥沙是發現，應編碼 K80.20 (膽囊泥沙，無併發症)。
12. **GERD (病史):** 胃食道逆流是慢性病史，應編碼 K21.9 (胃食道逆流，未特指)。
13. **___ Esophagus (病史):** 食道狹窄是慢性病史，應編碼 K22.8 (其他食道狹窄)。
14. **ERCP with sphincterotomy, stent placement and brushings (主要手術):** 這是診斷和治療程序，通常不編碼為診斷碼，除非有併發症或後遺症。

</think>

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Anemia (Chief Complaint and Hb 5.7):** 患者主訴貧血，且實驗室檢查顯示血紅蛋白 5.7，這是一個嚴重的貧血症狀。由於患者有 NASH 肝硬化病史，且在 EGD 中發現了胃潰瘍和十二指腸潰瘍，最合理的貧血原因可能是慢性病性貧血。因此，編碼 D63.1 (Anemia in chronic disease) 是最合適的。
2.  **NASH Cirrhosis (PMH):** 患者有 NASH 肝硬化病史，這是導致貧血的潛在原因。編碼 K74.60 (Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without cirrhosis) 似乎不正確，因為患者明確提到有肝硬化。正確的編碼應為 K74.61 (Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with cirrhosis)。
3.  **Hypertension (PMH):** 患者有高血壓病史。編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是正確的。
4.  **Morbid Obesity (PMH):** 患者有重度肥胖病史。編碼 E66.01 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories) 是正確的。
5.  **Bilateral Avascular Necrosis of the Hips (PMH):** 患者有雙側股骨頭無菌性壞死病史。編碼 M87.00 (Avascular necrosis of unspecified femoral head) 是正確的，並應指定雙側。
6.  **Gastric Ulcers (EGD Findings):** EGD 發現了出血性幽門通道潰瘍、十二指腸球部狹窄和線性十二指腸潰瘍。這些是導致貧血的直接原因。編碼 K25.5 (Gastric ulcer with hemorrhage) 和 K26.5 (Duodenal ulcer with hemorrhage) 是正確的。
7.  **Duodenal Bulb Stricture (EGD Findings):** 十二指腸球部狹窄是 EGD 發現的另一個重要發現。編碼 K26.6 (Duodenal stricture) 是正確的。
8.  **Anemia Workup and Transfusion:** 患者因貧血入院並接受了 2 單位紅血球輸注。雖然輸血本身不是一個診斷，但貧血的嚴重程度和需要輸血的事實強化了 D63.1 的編碼。
9.  **Volume Overload (Past Admission):** 患者曾因體積過多入院，這與肝硬化相關。編碼 R60.0 (Fluid overload) 是正確的。
10. **Normocytic Anemia (Past Admission):** 過去的診斷中提到「normocytic anemia likely due to...」，這與 D63.1 (Anemia in chronic disease) 一致，因此不需要單獨編碼。
11. **No Hematemesis, No Known Black/Bloody Stool:** 這些是陰性症狀，通常不需要編碼，除非有特定的臨床意義。
12. **Abdominal POC U/S Findings:** 超聲檢查未發現可觸及的囊腫或自由液體，這些是陰性發現，通常不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Severe Anemia (Chief Complaint):** 患者有嚴重貧血，且病史中提到「avascular necrosis and gastritis」，這通常會導致慢性貧血。因此，D64.9 (Anemia, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **Cirrhosis (Chief Complaint):** 患者有肝硬化病史，且病史中提到「avascular necrosis」，這通常與肝硬化相關。因此，K74.60 (Cirrhosis of liver without (acute) alcoholic (hepatitis) (ascites)) 是一個合理的編碼。
3.  **Abdominal Pain (Chief Complaint):** 患者有腹痛，且病史中提到「epigastric and has been going on for years」以及「new intermittent LLQ pain」。這表明腹痛是主要症狀。因此，R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
4.  **Fatigue, Weakness, Anasarca, Nausea:** 這些是症狀，但通常會被主要診斷或其後果所涵蓋。例如，貧血會導致疲勞和虛弱，肝硬化會導致腹水和水腫。
5.  **Congestion, Cough, Orthopnea:** 這些是呼吸系統症狀，但病史中沒有提到任何呼吸系統疾病，且沒有進一步的檢查結果支持。因此，這些症狀可能不需要單獨編碼，除非有明確的診斷。
6.  **Streaky Hematochezia:** 患者有便血，這是一個重要的症狀，需要編碼。R10.2 (Hematochezia) 是一個合理的編碼。
7.  **Avascular Necrosis (PMH):** 患者有無血管性壞死病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。因此，M89.0 (Avascular necrosis of unspecified site) 是一個合理的編碼。
8.  **Gastritis (PMH):** 患者有胃炎病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。因此，K29.6 (Gastritis, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
9.  **Hypertension (PMH):** 患者有高血壓病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。因此，I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是一個合理的編碼。
10. **Chills:** 患者有寒戰，這是一個症狀。因此，R50.9 (Chills, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **WBC 234 (98% lymphs)**：白血球計數極度升高，且淋巴細胞佔比極高，提示存在淋巴細胞增生性疾病。結合後續的血液學評估結果，最合理的診斷是慢性淋巴細胞白血病 (CLL)。對應 ICD-10 編碼：C91.0。
2.  **Hgb 5.2**：血紅蛋白極度低下，表示嚴重貧血。對應 ICD-10 編碼：D64.9 (未特指的重度貧血)。
3.  **Plt 102**：血小板計數低於正常範圍，表示血小板減少。對應 ICD-10 編碼：D69.6 (血小板減少症)。
4.  **Generalized fatigue, dyspnea, chest tightness on exertion**：這些症狀是貧血和可能的其他潛在疾病（如心臟問題）的表現。由於貧血是主要診斷，且症狀已由主要診斷解釋，通常不需要單獨編碼症狀。
5.  **Frequent PVCs on Holter (over 900 per hour)**：心電圖顯示頻繁的室性心搏過速，這是一個重要的心臟發現。對應 ICD-10 編碼：I47.1 (室性心律不整)。
6.  **TTE showed nonspecific findings - 1+ MR; bi-atrial enlargement; and a small anterior pericardial effusion**：超音波檢查發現了多個心臟結構異常，包括輕度二尖瓣反流、雙心房擴大和少量心包積液。這些是心臟的發現，但未被明確診斷為特定的疾病。因此，這些發現應作為心臟的其他發現進行編碼。對應 ICD-10 編碼：R09.89 (其他心臟症狀)。
7.  **BNP was 132 pointing away from any significant heart failure**：BNP 指數升高，但被認為不表示顯著心臟衰竭。因此，不編碼心臟衰竭。
8.  **EKG showed no ischemia**：心電圖未顯示缺血，因此不編碼心絞痛或心肌梗塞。

1.  **Chief Complaint: right UPJ obstructing calculus** (右輸尿管上段阻塞的結石)：這是一個明確的診斷，指右側輸尿管上段有阻塞的結石。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 **N20.11** (Right ureteral calculus with obstruction)。
2.  **Past medical history significant for recent nephrolithiasis** (近期有腎結石病史)：這表示患者有腎結石的病史，即使目前的結石位於輸尿管，仍需編碼腎結石的病史。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 **N20.0** (Kidney calculus)。
3.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right retrograde pyelogram, right ureteral stent placement** (右側逆行腎盂造影，右側輸尿管支架置放)：這些是治療程序，不是診斷，因此不需編碼為 ICD-10 診斷碼。
4.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions** (無已知過敏史或不良藥物反應)：這表示患者沒有過敏史，因此不需要編碼任何過敏相關的 ICD-10 編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Sneddon syndrome (necrotizing vasculitis)**: 這是一個複合診斷，包含兩種主要的醫學狀況：Sneddon 綜合徵和壞死性血管炎。Sneddon 綜合徵本身是一個特定的診斷，編碼為 Q89.89 (Other specified congenital malformations of the skin and subcutaneous tissue)。然而，由於病歷中明確提到「necrotizing vasculitis」，這是一個更具體的診斷，應優先編碼。壞死性血管炎的 ICD-10 編碼是 I77.8 (Other necrotizing vasculitis)。
2.  **CVA (___)**: 這表示患者有中風病史。由於病歷中沒有說明是缺血性還是出血性中風，且未提及後遺症，最合理的編碼是 I69.89 (Other late effects of cerebrovascular disease)。
3.  **anti-phospholipid syndrome**: 這是一個明確的診斷，編碼為 D68.62 (Antiphospholipid syndrome)。
4.  **history of uterine hemorrhage on warfarin**: 這表示患者有子宮出血病史，且正在服用抗凝血劑。子宮出血的 ICD-10 編碼是 N92.1 (Menorrhagia)。由於患者正在服用抗凝血劑，這是一個重要的共病，編碼為 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)。
5.  **DVTs with IVC filter in place since ___**: 患者有深靜脈血栓病史，且有腔靜脈濾器。深靜脈血栓的 ICD-10 編碼是 I82.4 (Deep vein thrombosis of other parts of lower extremities)。腔靜脈濾器的存在是重要的共病，編碼為 Z95.810 (Presence of other vascular filter)。
6.  **LLE DVT**: 患者此次就診的主要原因之一是左下肢深靜脈血栓。這是一個急性診斷，編碼為 I82.4 (Deep vein thrombosis of other parts of lower extremities)。
7.  **RLE cellulitis**: 患者此次就診的另一個主要原因是右下肢蜂窩組織炎。這是一個急性診斷，編碼為 L03.113 (Cellulitis of right lower leg)。
8.  **productive cough that she has had for the last several days**: 患者有生產性咳嗽，這是一個急性症狀，編碼為 R05.2 (Cough with sputum)。
9.  **Allergies**: 患者有多種藥物過敏史，這些是重要的共病，應編碼。過敏史的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z91.011 (Allergy to antibiotic)。由於患者對多種抗生素過敏，應使用 Z91.011 並在病例中註明具體的過敏藥物。
10. **Nattokinze (herbal anti-coagulant)**: 患者正在服用草藥抗凝血劑，這是一個重要的共病，編碼為 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)。
11. **Sodium was 129**: 患者有低鈉血症，這是一個急性症狀，編碼為 E87.1 (Hyponatremia)。
12. **Hemoglobin 8.5**: 患者有貧血，這是一個急性症狀，編碼為 D64.9 (Anemia, unspecified)。
13. **WBC count was 3.7K**: 患者有白血球減少，這是一個急性症狀，編碼為 D72.8 (Leukopenia, unspecified)。
14. **Platelet count was 145K**: 患者有血小板減少，這是一個急性症狀，編碼為 D69.6 (Thrombocytopenia)。
15. **Lactate was 1.0**: 患者有乳酸輕度升高，這是一個急性症狀，編碼為 R75.8 (Other abnormal findings in blood gases)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Left ankle fracture (L ankle fracture):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，且已進行了 ORIF 手術。因此，最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 S82.811A (Unspecified fracture of left ankle, initial encounter for closed fracture)。這表示左腳踝的未明確骨折，且是初次就診。
2.  **Fall down 3 stairs while holding lumbar at construction job:** 這是導致骨折的外部原因。S82.811A 已經包含了骨折的診斷，但需要一個外部原因代碼來描述導致骨折的事件。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 W19.XXXA (Unspecified fall, initial encounter)。這表示未明確的跌倒，且是初次就診。
3.  **Construction job:** 這是跌倒發生的場所。需要一個外部原因場所代碼。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 Y92.018 (Other place of occurrence in building, not elsewhere classified)。這表示在建築物內的其他場所，未被其他類別涵蓋。
4.  **Erythromycin base allergy:** 患者對紅黴素有過敏史。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z91.011 (Allergy to erythromycin)。這表示對紅黴素的過敏。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Direct admit for malignancy workup** - 這是一個主要的就診原因，但本身不是診斷，而是引導進一步評估的指徵。
2.  **Known Lynch syndrome** - 這是一個遺傳性癌症易感綜合徵，對應 ICD-10 編碼 D16.9 (Other specified malignant neoplasm of unspecified site) 作為主要的癌症診斷，並使用 Z85.71 (Personal history of other specified malignant neoplasm) 來表示其遺傳性。
3.  **Rapid clinical decline, 30 pounds weight loss, increasing fatigue, generally unwell** - 這些是症狀，但通常在有明確診斷的情況下，症狀編碼不是首要的。

逐步推理：
1.  **Acute right limb ischemia (Chief Complaint and Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):**  This is the primary reason for the hospitalization and the procedure performed. The ICD-10 code for acute limb ischemia is I70.209 (Acute limb ischemia, unspecified extremity, unspecified type). Since the right lower extremity is specified, I70.201 (Acute limb ischemia, right lower extremity, unspecified type) is more precise.
2.  **Right lower extremity embolectomy (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):**  This procedure is performed to treat the acute limb ischemia. The ICD-10 code for this procedure is 04Y00ZZ (Embolectomy of right lower extremity artery, open approach).
3.  **HTN (Hypertension):**  This is a chronic condition mentioned in the patient's history. The ICD-10 code for essential (primary) hypertension is I10.
4.  **HLD (Hyperlipidemia):**  This is another chronic condition mentioned in the patient's history. The ICD-10 code for unspecified hyperlipidemia is E78.5.
5.  **Allergies:**  The patient has multiple drug allergies. These should be coded using the appropriate Z91.010 (Allergy to antibiotic) and Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drug) codes for each specific drug. The listed allergies are:
    *   Macrobid (Nitrofurantoin): Z91.018
    *   Levaquin (Levofloxacin): Z91.018
    *   Prednisone: Z91.018
    *   Dicyclomine: Z91.018
    *   Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics): Z91.010
    *   Ciprofloxacin: Z91.018
    *   Cefdinir: Z91.018
    *   Biaxin (Clarithromycin): Z91.018
6.  **No h/o stroke or MI:**  This is a negative history and does not require a code.

逐步推理：
1.  **Asymptomatic lung nodule**: 這是患者就診的主要原因，且後續進行了右上葉切除術。這表明肺部病變是主要的臨床問題。由於後續進行了切除術，且病變被描述為「multiple lung lesions」，最合理的編碼是 ICD-10 編碼 R91.8 (Other specified abnormal findings of the respiratory system)。這是一個用於描述發現的異常，但尚未明確診斷為惡性或良性病變的編碼。
2.  **Robotic-assisted right upper lobectomy**: 這是一個手術程序，對應 ICD-10-PCS 編碼。由於是右上葉切除術，且使用了機械臂輔助，最合理的編碼是 0B7N3ZZ (Lobectomy of right upper lobe, open approach)。雖然描述中提到「robotic-assisted」，但 ICD-10-PCS 中並沒有專門的「機械臂輔助」代碼，因此使用「open approach」作為最接近的描述。
3.  **Mediastinal lymph node dissection**: 這是一個手術程序，對應 ICD-10-PCS 編碼。最合理的編碼是 0B900ZZ (Dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes, open approach)。
4.  **History of hyperlipidemia**: 這是一個慢性病史，對應 ICD-10 編碼 E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: neck swelling** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要根據病史和檢查結果找出其根本原因。
2.  **History of Present Illness: open cricopharyngeal myotomy and Zenker's diverticulopexy** - 患者接受了喉咽部手術，這是一個重要的既往病史。
3.  **Postoperative day 5 he stooped to pick up a laundry basket and carried this up the stairs with some strain. Later that evening he started to notice neck swelling and redness that progressed over the course of the next 2 days.** - 這表明手術部位在術後第五天因勞動而受到應力，導致了頸部腫脹和紅腫。這提示了手術部位的併發症，最可能的是手術部位的裂開或感染。
4.  **Temperature at home was as high as 100.4.** - 發燒是感染的常見症狀，進一步支持了感染的診斷。
5.  **s/p left neck wound exploration and washout** - 患者接受了頸部創傷的探查和清創術，這證實了手術部位的感染或裂開。
6.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p left neck wound exploration and washout, NG tube insertion** - 這進一步證實了頸部創傷的處理。

基於以上推理，最合理的編碼集合是：

*   **K31.82** (Postprocedural infection of other parts of the digestive system) - 用於表示手術部位的感染。
*   **K31.83** (Postprocedural wound dehiscence of other parts of the digestive system) - 用於表示手術部位的裂開。
*   **R23.3** (Swelling of neck) - 用於表示頸部腫脹。

逐步推理：
1.  **abdominal mass (Chief Complaint):** 這是主要的就診原因，但病史中沒有進一步描述其性質或診斷。由於沒有明確的診斷，且患者有慢性淋巴性白血病 (CLL) 和低免疫球蛋白血症，這可能與 CLL 的併發症或感染有關。在沒有明確診斷的情況下，通常會使用 R19.89 (Other specified symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen) 來表示未明確的腹部症狀。
2.  **diarrhea (History of Present Illness):** 患者有持續 4 天的腹瀉，且在就診時仍然存在。這是主要的症狀，應編碼為 R19.7 (Diarrhea)。
3.  **hypogammaglobulinemia (PMH):** 患者有低免疫球蛋白血症，這是一個重要的共病，應編碼為 D89.81 (Hypogammaglobulinemia)。
4.  **CLL (PMH):** 患者有慢性淋巴性白血病，這是一個重要的共病，應編碼為 C91.9 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, unspecified)。
5.  **melanoma (PMH):** 患者有黑色素瘤病史，這是一個重要的共病，應編碼為 Z85.81 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of skin)。
6.  **Bactrim allergy (Allergies):** 患者對 Bactrim (一種抗生素) 有過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to sulfonamides)。
7.  **intermittent nausea (History of Present Illness):** 患者有間歇性噁心，應編碼為 R11.0 (Nausea)。
8.  **mild abdominal cramping prior to BMs (History of Present Illness):** 患者有輕度腹痛，應編碼為 R10.3 (Abdominal pain)。
9.  **Zofran (History of Present Illness):** 患者使用 Zofran (一種止吐藥) 來緩解噁心，這表示他正在接受治療，應編碼為 Z51.11 (Encounter for treatment of nausea and vomiting)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Increased pain and drainage from chronic lateral right lower extremity wound with new breakdown on right medial malleolar.** 這描述了主要的症狀和問題，即右下肢慢性潰瘍的惡化和新發的內踝潰瘍。
    *   **R23.3 (Pain in limb)**: 由於患者主訴右下肢疼痛，且疼痛是主要症狀之一，因此編碼疼痛。
    *   **L03.111 (Cellulitis of right lower leg)**: 由於描述了「surround erythema」（周圍紅腫）和「drainage」（引流），這符合蜂窩性組織炎的診斷。
    *   **L97.511 (Chronic ulcer of right lower leg, left leg unspecified)**: 慢性潰瘍是主要的問題，且位於右下肢。雖然描述中提到「lateral right lower extremity wound」和「new medial malleolar breakdown」，但「chronic ulcer」通常指長期存在的潰瘍，因此編碼為慢性潰瘍。
    *   **L97.512 (Chronic ulcer of right ankle, left ankle unspecified)**: 新發的內踝潰瘍是另一個需要編碼的問題，位於右踝。
2.  **PMH: right venous stasis**: 患者有右側靜脈瘀滯的病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。
    *   **I83.401 (Chronic venous insufficiency of right lower extremity, unspecified severity)**: 靜脈瘀滯是慢性靜脈功能不全的表現，因此編碼為慢性靜脈功能不全。

逐步推理：
1.  **abdominal pain (主訴)**：這是患者就診的主要原因，但通常在有明確診斷的情況下，會優先編碼診斷本身。因此，K31.89 (Other specified abdominal pain) 可能不是最優先的，除非沒有更明確的診斷。
2.  **sever pancreatitis (非對比 CT 結果)**：這是一個明確的診斷，對應 K85.90 (Acute pancreatitis, unspecified, without necrosis or abscess)。
3.  **sudden onset epigastric abdominal pain with radiation to his back, associated nausea without vomiting, similar episode several weeks ago, less severe (病史描述)**：這些症狀支持急性胰臟炎的診斷，並強化了 K85.90 的合理性。
4.  **non-contrast CT which demonstrated sever pancreatitis (影像學結果)**：再次確認急性胰臟炎的診斷。
5.  **AST 560, ATLT 767, lipase > 3000, Tbili 3.1, WBC 22K, INR 1.1 (實驗室結果)**：這些實驗室異常值支持急性胰臟炎的診斷，並提示嚴重程度。
6.  **RUQ US showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis but mural thickening of the gallbladder (影像學結果)**：膽囊壁增厚是膽囊炎的徵兆，對應 K86.0 (Cholecystitis, unspecified)。
7.  **similar episode of epigastric abdominal pain several weeks ago that resolved after several days, but was less severe (病史描述)**：這表明患者有反覆的急性胰臟炎病史，對應 K85.91 (Acute pancreatitis, unspecified, with history of chronic pancreatitis)。
8.  **PMHx CAD s/p PCI (病史)**：冠狀動脈疾病，對應 I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。
9.  **PMHx HTN (病史)**：高血壓，對應 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
10. **PMHx HLD (病史)**：高脂血症，對應 E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。
11. **Allergies: Penicillins (過敏史)**：青黴素過敏，對應 Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin)。
12. **ERCP: sphincterotomy, removal of sludge, placement of a pancreatic duct stent and NJ tube (手術)**：這些是治療措施，通常不編碼為診斷，除非有併發症或需要跟蹤的後遺症。

逐步推理：
1.  **Leg swelling (LLE swelling):** 這是主要的主訴，且在病歷中被描述為「LLE swelling for the last 2 days」。這直接對應 ICD-10 編碼 R23.2 (Edema of lower extremity)。
2.  **Rash over calf (multiple small papules to anterior LLE, possibly folliculitis):** 這是一個明確的皮膚症狀，描述為「multiple small papules」，最合理的編碼是 L41.0 (Folliculitis)。
3.  **Chronic venous ulcer left med ankle and left lat calf:** 這是一個慢性且未癒合的靜脈性潰瘍，位於左腳踝和小腿。最合適的編碼是 I87.811 (Chronic venous ulcer of left lower leg)。
4.  **Recurrent DVTs in ___ and UEs s/p IVC filter c/b PEs on chronic warfarin:** 患者有深靜脈血栓病史，且有靜脈濾器植入史，這表明存在慢性靜脈功能不全。I82.4 (Postphlebitic syndrome) 是最合適的編碼。
5.  **Chronic ___ on methadone:** 患者有慢性藥物使用史，且正在使用美沙酮。這對應 F19.20 (Chronic (narcotic) poisoning, unspecified, uncomplicated)。
6.  **Last had a LLE DVT 6 months ago:** 這是一個近期的深靜脈血栓病史，對應 I82.4 (Postphlebitic syndrome)。
7.  **Right CP for the last 2d no sign SOB/DOE:** 患者有右側胸痛，但無呼吸困難或呼吸急促。這對應 R07.89 (Other chest pain)。
8.  **INR 4, PTT 39.6, normal Chem7, normal D-dimer:** 這些是實驗室檢查結果，表明凝血功能異常，但沒有明確的診斷。R73.1 (Abnormal prothrombin time) 是最合適的編碼。
9.  **IV Morphine 4 mg, IV ceftriaxone, oxycodone 5 mg x 2:** 這些是治療措施，通常不編碼為診斷，除非是不良反應或併發症。病歷中未提及不良反應，因此不編碼。
10. **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 這表示患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Palpitations (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴心悸，這是本次就診的主要原因。心悸本身不是一個診斷，而是症狀，通常會有其後續的診斷。在這種情況下，心悸是由心律不整（心房顫動/心房顫動伴快速心室反應）引起的，因此主要的診斷是心律不整。
2.  **Atrial Flutter (ED EKG finding):** 患者在急診室的 EKG 显示心房顫動。這是本次就診的主要診斷，也是導致心悸和心率加快的原因。
3.  **Rapid Ventricular Rate (RVR):** 患者在急診室的 EKG 显示心房顫動伴快速心室反應。這是一個重要的臨床發現，需要編碼。
4.  **Hypotension (BP 85/50):** 患者在急診室的血壓為 85/50，這是一個重要的症狀，需要編碼。
5.  **Sinus Bradycardia (PMH):** 患者有病史的症狀性心搏過緩，這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
6.  **Diffuse Lymphocytic B Cell Lymphoma s/p chemotherapy and consolidative ISRT:** 患者有擴散性淋巴細胞B細胞淋巴瘤，已接受化療和補充性放療。這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
7.  **RUE DVT s/p completion of Lovenox course:** 患者有右上肢深靜脈血栓病史，已完成低分子肝素治療。這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
8.  **Asthma:** 患者有哮喘病史，這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
9.  **COPD:** 患者有慢性阻塞性肺病，這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
10. **Hypertension:** 患者有高血壓病史，這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
11. **Hyperlipidemia:** 患者有高血脂病史，這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
12. **Moderate Cardiomegaly and Evidence of Heart Failure Complicated by a Low Ejection Fraction:** 患者有心臟擴大、心力衰竭和低射血分數的證據。這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
13. **Mild-to-moderate Peripheral and Centrilobular Emphysema, Diffuse Mild Bronchial Wall Thickening and Air Trapping:** 患者有輕度至中度的週邊和中央肺氣腫、支氣管壁輕度增厚和氣體滯留。這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
14. **Low Ejection Fraction:** 患者有低射血分數，這是一個重要的慢性病史，需要編碼。
15. **___ guided DC Cardioversion:** 患者接受了直流電擊心臟復律。這是一個重要的治療程序，需要編碼。
16. **___ dual chamber permanent pacemaker placement:** 患者接受了雙腔永久性心臟起搏器植入。這是一個重要的治療程序，需要編碼。
17. **Adverse Effect of Drugs (Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 2 without effect on rate):** 患者接受了靜脈注射的美托洛爾，但對心率無效。這是一個重要的治療反應，需要編碼。
18. **Environmental Factor of Injury (Chest X-ray showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic abnormality):** 患者接受了胸部CTA，結果顯示沒有肺栓塞或急性主動脈異常。這是一個重要的檢查結果，需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **C2 R-EPOCH (Chemotherapy for Follicular Lymphoma):** 患者因化療入院，且病史中提到「follicular lymphoma」，這是一個重要的診斷。C2 R-EPOCH 是一種化療方案，用於治療非霍奇金淋巴瘤。因此，應編碼為 C82.10 (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, unspecified, without mention of lymph node involvement)。
2.  **Placement of a double lumen chest power Port-a-cath:** 這是本次入院的主要手術程序，屬於植入式血管通路裝置。應編碼為 Z40.11 (Encounter for insertion of other vascular access device)。
3.  **Allergies: levofloxacin / Penicillins:** 患者對左氧氟沙星和青黴素過敏。應分別編碼為 Z88.0 (Allergy to penicillin) 和 Z88.2 (Allergy to other antibiotics)。
4.  **History of follicular lymphoma:** 這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼為 Z85.41 (Personal history of lymphoma)。
5.  **Pain in his right axilla and neck has greatly improved:** 這是一個症狀，但已改善，且未被描述為當前主要問題。通常，已改善的症狀不編碼，除非是入院的主要原因或需要持續治療。
6.  **Last admitted from ___ - ___ for C1 EPOCH:** 這表明患者有持續的淋巴瘤治療，但 C2 R-EPOCH 是本次入院的化療，因此 C82.10 已足夠涵蓋。

逐步推理：
1.  **high-grade serous adenocarcinoma c/w advanced ovarian cancer**：這是病人的主要診斷，且已明確為卵巢癌。ICD-10 編碼 C56.9 表示卵巢未特指的惡性腫瘤。
2.  **extensive omental caking with a large 5 x 5 cm implant in the left upper quadrant**：這描述了卵巢癌的轉移病灶，位於大網膜和左上腹。C56.9 已涵蓋卵巢癌本身，而轉移病灶通常不需要額外編碼，除非有特殊臨床意義。
3.  **bilateral pleural effusions**：雙側胸腔積液是卵巢癌的常見併發症。ICD-10 編碼 R24.9 表示未特指的胸腔積液。
4.  **large amount of ascites**：大量腹水也是卵巢癌的常見併發症。ICD-10 編碼 R18.8 表示未特指的腹水。
5.  **moderate volume ascites**：這與「large amount of ascites」是同一症狀，因此 R18.8 已足夠。
6.  **enlarged mammary lymph nodes and heterogeneity within the right breast**：右乳異常和淋巴結腫大，後續安排了乳房超音波導向活檢。這提示可能存在乳腺癌，但目前尚未確診。ICD-10 編碼 R24.9 (未特指的胸腔積液) 和 R18.8 (未特指的腹水) 已經涵蓋了卵巢癌的併發症，而乳腺異常尚未確診為惡性，因此不編碼為惡性腫瘤。
7.  **heterogeneous mass at 9 o'clock position**：右乳異常，後續安排了活檢。這是一個未確診的異常，應編碼為 R24.9 (未特指的胸腔積液) 和 R18.8 (未特指的腹水) 以外的症狀。R24.9 已經涵蓋了胸腔積液，而 R18.8 涵蓋了腹水，因此右乳異常應編碼為 R24.9 (未特指的胸腔積液) 以外的症狀。R24.9 通常用於胸腔積液，而 R24.9 也可以用於未特指的其他體腔積液，但更精確的編碼是 R24.9 (未特指的胸腔積液) 和 R18.8 (未特指的腹水)。右乳異常尚未確診為惡性，因此不編碼為惡性腫瘤。
8.  **epigastric/left upper quadrant dull pain**：上腹/左上腹鈍痛是卵巢癌的症狀。R10.3 表示腹痛。
9.  **increased abdominal distension**：腹脹是卵巢癌的症狀。R11.10 表示未特指的腹脹。
10. **anorexia**：厭食是卵巢癌的症狀。R63.0 表示厭食。
11. **intermittent dry cough and shortness of breath on exertion**：間歇性乾咳和運動時呼吸困難是卵巢癌的症狀。R05.2 表示乾咳，R06.02 表示運動時呼吸困難。
12. **not able to maintain her normal workouts**：無法維持正常運動是卵巢癌的症狀。R53.1 表示疲勞。
13. **CA-125 was >15,000**：CA-125 激增是卵巢癌的實驗室檢查結果，通常不單獨編碼，除非有特殊臨床意義。
14. **diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis that removed 4.6L**：診斷/治療性腹腔穿刺是治療程序，通常不編碼為診斷。
15. **ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of one of the omental nodules was c/w high-grade serous adenocarcinoma of likely mullerian origin**：超音波導向穿刺活檢確認了卵巢癌的診斷，這已經由 C56.9 涵蓋。
16. **CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis on ___ for staging**：CT 檢查是診斷程序，通常不編碼為診斷。
17. **mammography and biopsy were recommended to rule out metastasis disease or synchronous malignancy**：乳房X光和活檢是診斷程序，通常不編碼為診斷。
18. **Mammography on ___ showed heterogeneous mass at 9 o'clock position**：乳房X光顯示異常，後續安排了活檢。這是一個未確診的異常，應編碼為 R24.9 (未特指的胸腔積液) 以外的症狀。R24.9 已經涵蓋了胸腔積液，而 R18.8 涵蓋了腹水，因此右乳異常應編碼為 R24.9 (未特指的胸腔積液) 以外的症狀。R24.9 通常用於胸腔積液，而 R24.9 也可以用於未特指的其他體腔積液，但更精確的編碼是 R24.9 (未特指的胸腔積液) 和 R18.8 (未特指的腹水)。右乳異常尚未確診為惡性，因此不編碼為惡性腫瘤。
19. **scheduled for an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the right breast**：安排了右乳超音波導向活檢，這是一個診斷程序，通常不編碼為診斷。
20. **evaluated by medical oncology with Dr. ___**：由腫瘤科評估，這是一個診斷程序，通常不編碼為診斷。
21. **decreased appetite**：食欲減退是卵巢癌的症狀。R63.0 表示厭食。
22. **abdominal distension**：腹脹是卵巢癌的症狀。R11.10 表示未特指的腹脹。
23. **intermittent dry cough**：間歇性乾咳是卵巢癌的症狀。R05.2 表示乾咳。
24. **shortness of breath on exertion**：運動時呼吸困難是卵巢癌的症狀。R06.02 表示運動時呼吸困難。
25. **not able to maintain her normal workouts**：無法維持正常運動是卵巢癌的症狀。R53.1 表示疲勞。

逐步推理：
1.  **Abdominal pain (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，即使在 ED 中沒有疼痛，但這是促使就診的症狀。因此，編碼 R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified) 是合理的。
2.  **ETOH cirrhosis (PMHx):** 患者有酒精性肝硬化的病史，這是導致其多種併發症的根本原因。因此，編碼 K7030 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver without ascites) 是必要的。
3.  **Ascites (PMHx):** 患者有腹水，這是肝硬化的常見併發症。編碼 R188 (Ascites) 是正確的。
4.  **HE (Hepatic Encephalopathy) (PMHx):** 患者有肝性腦病變，這是肝硬化的另一個重要併發症。編碼 K729 (Hepatic encephalopathy, unspecified) 是正確的。
5.  **Varices (PMHx):** 患者有食道靜脈曲張，這是肝硬化的常見併發症。編碼 I8500 (Esophageal varices without bleeding) 是正確的。
6.  **Band ligation (PMHx):** 患者曾進行過食道靜脈曲張的結紮術，這是一個既往的治療程序，通常不需要編碼，除非有相關的併發症或後遺症。
7.  **Listed for liver transplant (PMHx):** 患者正在等待肝臟移植，這是一個重要的臨床狀態。編碼 Z940 (Status after liver transplant) 是正確的。
8.  **Recent umbilical hernia repair (PMHx):** 患者最近進行了臍疝修復手術，這是一個既往的外科手術。編碼 Z9081 (Presence of other specified acquired surgical implant) 是正確的。
9.  **R-sided abdominal tenderness since last paracentesis:** 患者在上次腹腔穿刺後出現右側腹痛，這是一個急性症狀。編碼 R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified) 已經涵蓋了這個症狀。
10. **Paracentesis attempted but patient did not tolerate and refused repeated attempts:** 患者不耐受腹腔穿刺，這是一個與治療相關的問題。編碼 Z538 (Encounter for other specified therapeutic procedures) 是正確的。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Perforated diverticulitis with contained perforation and possible fistula formation between colon and small bowel:** 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是導致其症狀（腹痛、血尿、排尿困難）的根本原因。K57.31 (Diverticulitis of colon with perforation) 是描述結腸憩室炎伴穿孔的最合適編碼。由於提到「contained perforation」，這表明穿孔是局限性的，未導致腹膜炎，因此 K57.31 是最精確的選擇。此外，「possible fistula formation between colon and small bowel」表明存在腸道間的異常連接，這應編碼為 K56.6 (Intestinal fistula)。
2.  **History of MI (___) s/p stents:** 患者有心肌梗死病史，並已植入支架。I25.2 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with previous myocardial infarction) 是描述原發性冠狀動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病伴既往心肌梗死的最合適編碼。
3.  **Congenital bowel malformation s/p bowel resection at 2 days of age and ___ years of age:** 患者有先天性腸道畸形病史，並已進行多次腸切除手術。Q43.8 (Other congenital malformations of large intestine) 是描述其他先天性大腸畸形的最合適編碼。此外，由於患者有複雜的外科病史，這會影響其就診和治療的決策，因此 Z87.0 (Personal history of other congenital malformations) 也應編碼以表示其既往病史。
4.  **History of several SBOs prior which were all resolved with medical management:** 患者有小腸阻塞的病史，雖然這些事件已通過非手術方式解決，但這仍然是其重要的既往病史。K56.6 (Intestinal fistula) 已經涵蓋了腸道異常連接，而 K56.6 本身也與腸道阻塞相關。因此，K56.6 已經足夠描述其小腸阻塞的病史。
5.  **Allergies: codeine:** 患者對可待因過敏。Z91.011 (Allergy to opioid analgesic) 是描述對阿片類止痛藥過敏的最合適編碼。
6.  **Never had a colonoscopy and was told to never get one due to her complex surgical past:** 患者因複雜的外科病史而被建議不要進行結腸鏡檢查。Z87.0 (Personal history of other congenital malformations) 已經涵蓋了其先天性腸道畸形的病史，這也是其不能進行結腸鏡檢查的原因。
7.  **Symptoms: abdominal pain, hematuria, dysuria:** 這些是患者就診時的症狀，但由於已經有明確的診斷（K57.31, K56.6），這些症狀通常不需要單獨編碼，除非它們是主要診斷或需要特殊處理的症狀。在這種情況下，腹痛是 K57.31 的一個表現，血尿和排尿困難是 K56.6 的一個表現，因此不需要單獨編碼。
8.  **Last bowel movement was day prior to presentation and continues to pass flatus:** 這些是患者就診時的症狀，但由於已經有明確的診斷（K57.31, K56.6），這些症狀通常不需要單獨編碼，除非它們是主要診斷或需要特殊處理的症狀。在這種情況下，這些症狀是 K57.31 和 K56.6 的一個表現，因此不需要單獨編碼。
9.  **No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting:** 這些是患者就診時的負面症狀，通常不需要編碼，除非它們是主要診斷或需要特殊處理的症狀。在這種情況下，這些症狀是 K57.31 的一個表現，因此不需要單獨編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation (last flatus on ___):** 這些是主要的症狀，描述了急性腹痛的表現。最合適的編碼是 K35.89 (Other specified intestinal obstruction)。雖然沒有明確的阻塞，但這些症狀集合通常指向腸道阻塞。
2.  **No bowel movements for two days, last flatus on ___:** 這進一步支持了腸道阻塞的診斷，並強化了 K35.89 的選擇。
3.  **Colonoscopy in ___ showed a 3 mm sessile-serrated adenoma in the cecum:** 這是一個發現的病變，需要編碼。K63.5 (Sessile serrated polyp of large intestine) 是最合適的編碼。
4.  **Scheduled for follow-up in ___ years:** 這表明病變是良性且需要跟蹤的，因此 K63.5 是正確的選擇，而不是惡性或未明確性質的編碼。
5.  **No intra-abdominal surgeries:** 這排除了術後併發症的可能。
6.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 這表示沒有需要編碼的過敏史或不良反應。

逐步推理：
1.  **Mood instability, depression, severe mood lability, irritability, fatigue, poor sleep, feeling ""drugged"" during the day:** 這些症狀描述了患者的情緒和心理狀態，符合躁鬱症 (Bipolar Affective Disorder) 的特徵，特別是躁狂和抑鬱的交替。因此，編碼 F31.9 (Bipolar Affective Disorder, Unspecified) 是合適的。
2.  **Complex partial seizures, spells, episodes of unresponsiveness, stiffening up, flexion of arms, bradycardia, cluster of spells, prescribed Ativan, Keppra, Lamotrigine, Clonazepam, routine EEG, plan to crosstaper anticonvulsants and start a new agent such as oxcarbazepine:** 這些是癫痫的明確診斷和治療。因此，編碼 G40.909 (Epilepsy, Unspecified, Without Status Epilepticus) 是合適的。
3.  **Shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, which occur spontaneously without warning and lasting 30 seconds-1 minute:** 這些症狀描述了心悸和胸痛，可能與心律不整或心臟相關問題有關。由於沒有明確的心臟診斷，且這些症狀在服用抗癲癇藥物後出現，最合理的編碼是 R00.2 (Palpitations) 和 R07.9 (Chest Pain, Unspecified)。
4.  **Swollen lymph nodes, 2 large painful nodules over her left neck, one over her right ear:** 這些是淋巴結腫大的症狀，編碼 R59.6 (Lymphadenopathy) 是合適的。
5.  **Balance has been ""off"" and she has been leaning on her boyfriend when walking with him:** 這描述了步態問題，編碼 R26.8 (Other gait disturbance) 是合適的。
6.  **History of complex partial seizures followed by Dr. ___ resection on left leg:** 這表明患者有癲癇的病史，且有過手術治療。因此，編碼 Z86.79 (Personal history of other diseases and conditions) 是合適的。
7.  **History of aortic coarctation:** 這表明患者有主動脈縮窄的病史，編碼 Z86.79 (Personal history of other diseases and conditions) 是合適的。
8.  **Adverse reaction to AEDs (Keppra, Lamotrigine, Clonazepam):** 這些症狀（如情緒不穩定、抑鬱、心悸、胸痛、短暫性意識喪失、步態問題、淋巴結腫大）被認為是抗癲癇藥物的不良反應。因此，編碼 T46.0X5A (Adverse effect of other antiepileptic drugs, initial encounter) 是合適的。
9.  **Abdominal pain after meals:** 這描述了腹痛，編碼 R10.9 (Abdominal pain, unspecified) 是合適的。
10. **Adverse effect of drugs (Keppra, Lamotrigine, Clonazepam):** 這些藥物的不良反應已經被 T46.0X5A 涵蓋，因此不需要單獨編碼。
11. **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 這表示患者沒有已知的過敏史，因此不需要編碼。

2.  **h/o non-insulin dependent DM** - 2型糖尿病，編碼 E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。
3.  **known LBBB** - 左束支傳導阻滯，編碼 I44.6 (Left bundle-branch block)。
4.  **hernia repair** - 有疝氣修復史，但未提及當前疝氣，因此不編碼。
5.  **recurrent abdominal pain after recent hospital admission in ___ for diverticulitis** - 這表明憩室炎是腹痛的根源。
6.  **CT with persistent sigmoid diverticulosis and interval development of proximal sigmoid diverticulitis is seen with signs of perforation or abscess formation** - 這明確診斷為憩室炎，且有穿孔或膿腫形成的跡象。
7.  **CT Abd/Pelv: 1. Mild pericolonic stranding and sigmoid diverticula is consistent with provided history of recent diverticulitis. A lobulated focus of air is present in this region, unclear if this is within a diverticula or alternatively extraluminal. No fluid collection or abscess formation.** - 這進一步支持憩室炎的診斷，並指出有空氣聚集，這可能與穿孔或膿腫形成相關。
8.  **She states that her abdominal pain has been persistent since discharge. It worsened two days prior to presentation, primarily on the right side. Continues to have bowel movment with streaks of blood. Last BM day prior to admission. No fever or chills, Denies dysuria on my interview, but with dysuria per her PCP.** - 這些症狀支持憩室炎的診斷，包括腹痛、便血、排便困難。
9.  **Labs were notable for: WBC 11.1 (N 76.9), LFTs WNL, Lipase 62, lytes WNL. Lactate 2.3. U/A WNL, slightly concentrated spec 1.013 without ketones** - 白血球升高支持感染。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Splenic infarct** - 患者的主要主訴是脾臟梗塞，這是一個明確的診斷。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 I86.0 (Splenic infarction)。
2.  **History of recent mono infection** - 患者有近期單核球增多症的病史，這通常是由 EB 病毒引起的。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 B27.8 (Other specified human herpesvirus infections)。
3.  **History of one month of sore throat, tonsillar swelling, and discharge** - 這些症狀是單核球增多症的典型表現，因此不需要單獨編碼。
4.  **Enlarged spleen to 15cm** - 脾臟腫大是單核球增多症的常見併發症，且在脾臟梗塞的背景下，這是一個重要的臨床發現。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 R16.0 (Enlarged spleen)。
5.  **Hgb of 13.4 and platelets of 132** - 血紅蛋白和血小板計數在正常範圍內，因此不需要編碼為貧血或血小板減少症。
6.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions** - 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **bilateral calcaneus fractures (雙側跟骨骨折)**：這是患者就診的主要原因，且已進行了手術治療 (ORIF)。跟骨骨折的 ICD-10 編碼是 S92.011A (右側跟骨開放性骨折，初次就診) 和 S92.012A (左側跟骨開放性骨折，初次就診)。由於病歷中未明確說明是開放性還是閉合性骨折，但提到了「fall approximately 20 feet in height」，這通常會導致開放性骨折，因此選擇開放性骨折的編碼。
2.  **right wrist sprain (右腕扭傷)**：病歷中提到「right wrist sprain」，且「splinted and elevating his legs」，這表明需要治療。腕部扭傷的 ICD-10 編碼是 S62.111A (右側腕部扭傷，初次就診)。
3.  **fall approximately 20 feet in height (約20英尺高處墜落)**：這是導致骨折和扭傷的外部原因。高處墜落的 ICD-10 編碼是 W19.XXXA (其他高處墜落，初次就診)。
4.  **Environmental factor of injury (傷害的環境因素)**：病歷中提到「demonstrating at ___ when he was chased by security」，這表明傷害發生在「其他地方」。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Y92.099 (其他地方，未特指)。
5.  **Person accompanying the patient (陪同患者的人)**：病歷中提到「He is accompanied by his mother today in the office」，這表明有其他人陪同。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Y92.11 (母親)。
6.  **Patient's occupation (患者職業)**：病歷中提到「He goes to art school in ___」，這表明患者是學生。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 Y97.89 (其他學生)。
7.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions (無已知過敏史/不良藥物反應)**：病歷中明確指出無過敏史，因此不需要編碼。
8.  **Other relevant information (其他相關資訊)**：病歷中提到「He denies any back pain. He has been splinted and elevating his legs. He has been using a wheelchair. He denies any paresthesias or dysesthesias.

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Dizziness** - 患者主訴為眩暈，且病史中描述了急性眩暈、惡心、嘔吐，且在改變體位時加劇，這符合良性陣發性姿勢性眩暈 (BPPV) 的特徵。因此，編碼 R42.10 (Vertigo, unspecified) 是合適的。
2.  **History of autoimmune hepatitis complicated by cirrhosis** - 患者有自身免疫性肝炎病史，並併發肝硬化。自身免疫性肝炎的 ICD-10 編碼是 K75.81 (Autoimmune hepatitis)。肝硬化的 ICD-10 編碼是 K74.60 (Cirrhosis of liver, unspecified)。
3.  **Vomiting 7 times, prompted by dizziness in the setting of changing positions** - 患者有惡心和嘔吐，且與眩暈相關。這符合惡心和嘔吐的診斷。編碼 R11.0 (Nausea) 和 R11.10 (Vomiting, unspecified) 是合適的。
4.  **Mild dysuria at home** - 患者有輕度排尿困難。這符合排尿困難的診斷。編碼 R30.0 (Dysuria) 是合適的。
5.  **Intermittent headaches, which bother her once every couple of weeks** - 患者有間歇性頭痛，每兩週發生一次。這符合間歇性頭痛的診斷。編碼 R51.0 (Headache) 是合適的。
6.  **History of a TBI in the distant past. She had been working at an airport, and was struck in the head by some machinery. She reports losing consciousness, and having some residual right-sided weakness from this event. She recovered fully with ___** - 患者有遠期腦外傷史，導致右側輕微殘留無力，但已完全康復。這屬於腦外傷的後遺症。編碼 Z87.89 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) 是合適的，用於表示遠期腦外傷史。
7.  **Denies this ever happening to her before** - 患者否認此類情況曾發生過，這支持了良性陣發性姿勢性眩暈 (BPPV) 的診斷，而非其他更嚴重的眩暈原因。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Alcohol Withdrawal** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，且病史中明確提到「acute alcohol intoxication and request for detox」，以及「symptoms of insomnia, tremors, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, and tremulousness upon alcohol cessation」，這些都是酒精戒斷的典型症狀。因此，F10.20 (Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated) 和 F10.21 (Alcohol dependence, with alcohol withdrawal syndrome) 都是必要的。F10.21 更具體地描述了戒斷症狀。
2.  **History of active alcohol abuse c/b previous withdrawal seizures** - 這表明患者有酒精依賴史，且曾有戒斷癲癇發作。F10.20 (Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated) 已經涵蓋了酒精依賴，而 G40.909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus) 可用於描述既往的癲癇發作史。
3.  **Alcoholic cirrhosis decompensated by variceal bleed s/p banding** - 這是一個複雜的診斷。K70.30 (Alcoholic cirrhosis without ascites) 用於描述酒精性肝硬化。K75.80 (Other specified diseases of liver) 可用於描述肝硬化引起的併發症，如食道靜脈曲張出血。I85.00 (Esophageal varices without hemorrhage) 用於描述食道靜脈曲張，即使已經進行了結紮術 (s/p banding)。
4.  **Concern for CKD** - 這表明患者有慢性腎臟病。N18.6 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5) 用於描述慢性腎臟病第5期，這是終末期腎臟病，通常需要透析。
5.  **Allergies: vancomycin / cefepime / meropenem** - 這些是患者的藥物過敏史。Z88.0 (Allergy to penicillin) 用於描述青黴素類藥物過敏，而 Z88.2 (Allergy to other antibiotics) 用於描述其他抗生素過敏。
6.  **Loss of a close friend, which prompted him to begin drinking beer intermittently** - 這是一個心理社會因素，可能影響患者的酒精使用。Z63.4 (Problems related to loss of a close family member) 用於描述與親密家庭成員喪失相關的問題。
7.  **Initial presentation to the ED with acute alcohol intoxication** - 這是一個急性症狀。F10.10 (Alcohol intoxication, uncomplicated) 用於描述酒精中毒。

逐步推理：
1.  **Intractable vomiting, abdominal pain, and increased ostomy output**: 這些是主要的就診原因。腹痛和嘔吐是症狀，而增加的造口輸出是Crohn's病的表現。由於患者有Crohn's病史，且目前症狀與其相關，因此應編碼為Crohn's病的急性發作。K50.810 (Crohn's disease, unspecified site, with complications) 是最合適的選擇，因為它涵蓋了腹痛、嘔吐和增加的造口輸出。
2.  **History of CKD**: 慢性腎臟病是重要的共病。N18.6 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5) 表示第五期慢性腎臟病，這與患者需要透析和高血鉀 (K+ 6.2) 的情況相符。
3.  **History of Crohn's disease s/p colectomy c/b enterocutaneous fistula**: 這已經在 K50.810 中涵蓋，但需要特別注意造口的存在。Z90.6 (Presence of colostomy) 表示結腸造口的存在。
4.  **History of HFpEF (last EF >55%)**: 這表示心臟功能不全。I50.32 (Heart failure due to unspecified heart disease, with reduced ejection fraction) 是最合適的選擇，因為它描述了射血分數降低的心臟衰竭。
5.  **History of COPD on 4L O2**: 慢性阻塞性肺病是重要的共病。J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified) 是最合適的選擇。
6.  **History of DVT/PE on warfarin**: 深部靜脈血栓和肺栓塞是重要的共病。I82 (Deep vein thrombosis of unspecified site) 和 I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified) 是最合適的選擇。患者正在服用華法林，這表示正在接受抗凝治療，因此 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants) 也是必要的。
7.  **History of UTI**: 尿路感染是導致患者入院的另一個原因。N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified) 是最合適的選擇。
8.  **Adverse effect of drugs (laxatives/opioids)**: 患者因嘔吐和腹痛而使用嗎啡和昂丹司瓊，這可能導致不良反應。T47.4X5A (Adverse effect of other and unspecified opioid analgesics, initial encounter) 是最合適的選擇。
9.  **Allergies: Remicade / Lipitor / simvastatin / Humira**: 這些是重要的過敏史。Z91.011 (Allergy to other biologicals)、Z91.012 (Allergy to other lipid-lowering agents)、Z91.019 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 是最合適的選擇。
10. **Environmental factor of injury (fall)**: 患者有跌倒史，這是一個重要的環境因素。Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause) 是最合適的選擇。
11. **Other significant findings**:
    *   **WBC 22.6**: 白血球升高，表示感染。R78.8 (Other abnormal findings in blood count) 是最合適的選擇。
    *   **Cl 92, BUN/Cr 49/2.6, Alk Phos 167, Lipase 180, Plt 622, ___ 29.2, PTT 41.1, INR 2.7, Lactate 2.**: 這些是實驗室檢查結果，表示多種異常，包括低血鉀、高血鈣、高血小板、高乳酸等。R78.8 是最合適的選擇，因為它涵蓋了其他血液檢查異常。
    *   **3+ pitting edema of legs bilaterally**: 双下肢水腫，表示心臟衰竭的症狀。R60.0 (Edema) 是最合適的選擇。
    *   **+TTP w/ guarding in lower quadrants bilaterally**: 腹膜炎，表示腹腔內感染。K66.0 (Peritonitis, unspecified) 是最合適的選擇。
    *   **Linear bibasilar opacities which are most likely atelectasis**: 肺部不張，表示呼吸系統的症狀。J98.81 (Atelectasis) 是最合適的選擇。
    *   **Stomach is distended**: 胃部擴張，表示消化系統的症狀。K31.81 (Other specified gastroenteritis and colitis) 是最合適的選擇。
    *   **Urinated once in the past 24 hours, small volume and amber in color**: 尿量減少，表示腎臟功能不全的症狀。R35.0 (Oliguria) 是最合適的選擇。
    *   **Increased ostomy output**: 造口輸出增加，表示消化系統的症狀。K50.810 已經涵蓋了Crohn's病的急性發作，因此不需要額外編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: pneumonia** - 患者因肺炎就診，且CT掃描顯示右下葉壞死性肺炎。這直接對應到 ICD-10 編碼 J18.1 (Pneumonia due to other organisms, unspecified site)。由於是壞死性肺炎，J18.1 是最合適的選擇。
2.  **History of smoking** - 吸煙史是慢性阻塞性肺病 (COPD) 的重要風險因素，但本身不是一個診斷，而是背景資訊。
3.  **History of COPD** - 患者有COPD病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼為 J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified)。
4.  **Recently diagnosed metastatic NSCLC with mets to bones** - 患者有非小細胞肺癌 (NSCLC) 且已轉移至骨頭。這是一個主要的惡性腫瘤診斷，應編碼為 C34.9 (Malignant neoplasm of other parts of trachea, bronchus and lung) 代表肺癌本身，以及 C79.51 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone and bone marrow) 代表骨頭轉移。
5.  **Currently on carboplatin/pemetrexed** - 這表示患者正在接受化學治療，應編碼為 Z51.11 (Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy)。
6.  **Recent admission for SVC syndrome s/p radiation (completed on ___ and stent placement (in ___)** - 患者有上腔靜脈症候群 (SVC syndrome) 的病史，且已接受放療和支架置入。這是一個重要的既往症狀和治療，應編碼為 I87.8 (Other disorders of veins) 來表示靜脈問題，以及 Z86.71 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm) 來表示肺癌的個人病史。
7.  **Chemoradiation related mucositis/esophagitis** - 放療和化療引起的黏膜炎和食道炎是治療的副作用，應編碼為 K14.3 (Mucositis) 和 K22.8 (Other esophageal disorders)。
8.  **Back pain and right sided chest pain just below the breast region** - 患者有背痛和右側胸痛，這與骨轉移相關。應編碼為 M80.0 (Acute osteoporotic vertebral fracture) 來表示骨質疏鬆性脊椎骨折，以及 M80.85 (Other specified osteoporotic fracture) 來表示其他骨質疏鬆性骨折。
9.  **Fever, chills, productive cough with brown colored sputum, short of breath, back pain, right sided chest pain** - 這些是肺炎的症狀，但 J18.1 已經涵蓋了肺炎的診斷，因此不需要單獨編碼這些症狀。
10. **Adverse effect of drugs (narcotics)** - 患者在ED接受了止痛藥，這可能導致不良反應。應編碼為 T47.2X5A (Adverse effect of other analgesics, antipyretics and anti-inflammatory agents, accidental (single substance), initial encounter)。
11. **Environmental factor of injury (home)** - 患者是在家中發病，應編碼為 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence)。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Cough, fever, night sweats, malaise, achiness, bone pain, fatigue, low-grade fevers, dysuria, frequency, and interstitial opacities on CXR**：這些症狀和檢查結果指向感染。由於患者有癌症病史，且正在接受化療，這增加了機會性感染的可能性。在沒有明確病原體的情況下，且考慮到癌症患者免疫功能低下，最合理的診斷是「其他機會性感染」，對應 ICD-10 編碼 B99.8。
2.  **Triple negative breast cancer, mastectomy, 4 cycles ddAC, first taxol 2 weeks ago but wasn't feeling well enough**：患者有乳腺癌病史，且正在接受化療。這是一個重要的慢性疾病，對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z85.31 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast)。
3.  **Oxycodone use**：患者正在使用阿片類藥物，這是一個重要的用藥史，對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z79.51 (Long term (current) use of opioid analgesics)。
4.  **Allergies: Latex / Ampicillin**：患者對乳膠和氨芐西林過敏，這需要記錄在案，對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z91.011 (Allergy to latex) 和 Z91.012 (Allergy to penicillin)。
5.  **Dysuria and frequency, UA markedly abnormal, fosfamycin given, urine Cx not properly processed**：這些症狀和檢查結果指向泌尿道感染。儘管尿液檢查在 ED 顯示正常，但患者在就診前的症狀和之前的檢查結果表明存在泌尿道感染。因此，應編碼泌尿道感染，對應 ICD-10 編碼 N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified)。
6.  **CXR showed interstitial opacities concerning for atypical infection, was started on levofloxacin**：胸部 X 光顯示間質性病變，考慮為非典型感染，並開始使用左氧氟沙星治療。這進一步支持了機會性感染的診斷，並強化了 B99.8 的合理性。

逐步推理：
1.  **Infected Kidney Stone (Chief Complaint):**  The patient presents with an obstructive stone in the left proximal ureter, stranding around the ureter, mild hydronephrosis, and is febrile with leukocytosis, indicating an infection. This is a severe case of a kidney stone with infection and obstruction. The most specific code for this is **N20.10** (Unilateral obstructive uropathy without calculus, left side). However, since the stone is explicitly mentioned as the cause of obstruction, **N20.11** (Unilateral obstructive uropathy with calculus, left side) is more appropriate. Additionally, the infection is indicated by fever, leukocytosis, and the term ""infected kidney stone,"" so **N10.3** (Acute pyelonephritis, unspecified side) should be included to capture the infection component.
2.  **Chills:**  Chills are a symptom of infection, and the fever and leukocytosis further support this. While **R50.9** (Fever, unspecified) is a valid code for the fever, the chills are a manifestation of the underlying infection (N10.3), so they may not need a separate code unless they are a significant, distinct symptom.
3.  **HTN (Hypertension):**  This is a chronic condition. The most general code for essential (primary) hypertension is **I10** (Essential (primary) hypertension).
4.  **ESBL UTI (Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Urinary Tract Infection):**  This is a significant history that explains the choice of IV Zosyn. The presence of ESBL indicates a resistant infection. The most appropriate code for this is **Z86.72** (Personal history of other specified infectious and parasitic diseases), which is used for a history of a specific infection that may affect current treatment decisions.
5.  **Colovesical Fistula:**  This is a chronic condition. The most appropriate code for a colovesical fistula is **K66.8** (Other specified diseases of bladder).
6.  **Hypotension:**  The patient was intermittently hypotensive to the ___ systolic and started on norepinephrine. This is a significant finding. The most appropriate code for hypotension is **R05.9** (Hypotension, unspecified).
7.  **Lactate of 2.3:**  This is a laboratory finding indicating possible sepsis or shock. The most appropriate code for elevated lactate is **R74.0** (Elevated lactate).
8.  **Flagyl Allergy:**  This is an allergy to a medication. The most appropriate code for this is **Z91.011** (Allergy to metronidazole).
9.  **Left Percutaneous Nephrostomy, CVL placement in RIJ, RIJ removal:**  These are procedures performed, not diagnoses. They are typically coded as procedures (ICD-10-PCS) rather than diagnoses (ICD-10-CM).

逐步推理：
1.  **NEPHROLITHIASIS (Chief Complaint):** 患者因左側腎結石就診，且病史中提到「prior ICU admission for sepsis, obstruction left ureteral stone (at which point PCN was placed)」，這表明結石是導致感染和阻塞的原因。因此，應編碼為「N20.10」（左側腎結石伴尿路阻塞，無感染）。
2.  **Paraplegia s/p MVA (History of Present Illness):** 患者有脊髓損傷導致的截癱，這是其重要的慢性病史。應編碼為「G82.00」（截癱，未指明部位）。
3.  **Prior ICU admission for sepsis (History of Present Illness):** 患者有敗血症病史，且是導致其就診的關鍵因素之一。應編碼為「A41.9」（未特指的敗血症）。
4.  **Obstruction left ureteral stone (History of Present Illness):** 患者因左側輸尿管結石導致阻塞，這也是導致敗血症的原因之一。應編碼為「N20.10」（左側腎結石伴尿路阻塞，無感染）。
5.  **PCN (Percutaneous nephrolithotomy) (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
6.  **Demerol Allergy (Allergies):** 患者對 Demerol（Meperidine）過敏。應編碼為「Z91.011」（對 Meperidine 的過敏狀態）。
7.  **Antegrade nephrostogram through existing percutaneous access (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個診斷程序，不是診斷本身，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
8.  **New percutaneous access (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。
9.  **Antegrade ureteral stent placement (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼。

9.  **Persistent cough with the presence of reticular nodular pattern seems to be highly consistent with neoplasm rather than inflammatory changes:** 這進一步支持 CLL 的肺部表現。
10. **The presence of groundless opacities may be related to chronic GERD:** 這表明慢性胃食道逆流是導致肺部病變的潛在原因。K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis) 用於此。
11. **PMHx CLL not on therapy:** C91.9 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, unspecified) 用於 CLL。
12. **PMHx colon cancer s/p resection ___:** Z85.060 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of colon) 用於結腸癌的個人病史。
13. **PMHx AS s/p TAVR ___:** I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 用於動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病，Z95.5 (Prosthetic heart valve) 用於人工瓣膜。

15. **PMHx ___:** 這是一個未明確的診斷，但由於患者有慢性胃食道逆流，且病歷中提到「The presence of groundless opacities may be related to chronic GERD」，因此 K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis) 已經涵蓋了此點。
16. **PMHx DM:** E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 用於糖尿病。
17. **Allergies: Codeine / Darvocet-N 100 / Vicodin:** Z91.011 (Allergy to codeine), Z91.012 (Allergy to Darvocet-N 100), Z91.013 (Allergy to Vicodin) 用於這些藥物過敏。
18. **Influenza A, completed course of Tamiflu, was found to have a new oxygen requirement of 4L and was discharged to rehab:** Z87.891 (History of other infectious and parasitic diseases) 用於流感的個人病史。
19. **In route to ___, she was in afib with RVR so EMS gave one dose of cardizem and her HR improved:** I48.91 (Atrial fibrillation) 已經涵蓋了心房顫動，R00.2 (Tachycardia) 用於心動過速。
20. **CT Chest obtained at ___ w/o contrast showed a known RUL lesion and multifocal sub segmental ground glass opacities consistent with pneumonitis with significant lymphadenopathy:** R92.81 (Finding of lesion of lung, unspecified) 用於已知的肺部病變。
21. **At ___, she received IV Lasix x1 without improvement, and she was started on IV methylpred and azithromycin for atypical infectious coverage:** R06.02 (Hypoxia) 用於低氧血症，R06.02 (Dyspnea) 用於呼吸困難，R09.02 (Hypoxia) 用於低氧血症，R06.2 (Wheezing) 用於喘息，R05.9 (Cough, unspecified) 用於咳嗽。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath (SOB)** - 這是主要症狀，但通常會有更精確的診斷碼來解釋其原因。
2.  **PMH: likely ischemic CMP last EF 40%** - 這表明患者有心臟病史，且左心室射出分率 (LVEF) 為 40%，這符合心臟衰竭的診斷。由於是缺血性心肌病，且 LVEF < 40%，最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 I5022 (Congestive heart failure due to ischemic heart disease with reduced ejection fraction)。
3.  **PMH: CAD s/p 3V CABG (___) and PCI (___ stenting in ___)** - 這表示患者有冠狀動脈疾病，且有冠狀動脈繞道手術和支架植入的病史。I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 是描述冠狀動脈疾病的一般性編碼。
4.  **PMH: h/o atrial flutter s/p DCCV in ___ on warfarin** - 這表示患者有心房顫動的病史，且正在服用抗凝血劑。I489 (Other specified cardiac arrhythmias) 是描述心房顫動的編碼。
5.  **PMH: T2DM on insulin** - 這表示患者有第二型糖尿病，且正在使用胰島素。E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 是描述第二型糖尿病的編碼。
6.  **PMH: HLD** - 這表示患者有高血脂。E785 (Hyperlipidemia) 是描述高血脂的編碼。
7.  **PMH: prostate cancer s/p ureteral stent in ___ and s/p recent L CEA in ___** - 這表示患者有前列腺癌病史，且有輸尿管支架和左側結腸切除術的病史。Z8540 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of prostate) 是描述前列腺癌病史的編碼。
8.  **Progressive worsening of SOB, PND, orthopnea, swelling (R>L), nonproductive cough, weight loss** - 這些都是心臟衰竭的症狀和體徵，已由 I5022 覆蓋。
9.  **Admitted to ___ for additional testing and treatment. He was being treated with increasing doses of PO Lasix and occasional metolazone as an outpatient the week prior to admission. He reportedly had a CXR which showed no frank pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions (L>R) which were unchanged from previous imaging. He also had a TTE which showed worsening of his mitral regurgitation and moderate LV dysfunction, no EF or official report was included in the transfer paperwork.** - 這些檢查結果進一步支持心臟衰竭的診斷，並指出有二尖瓣反流和中度左心室功能障礙，但 I5022 已涵蓋這些。

逐步推理：
1.  **hematemesis (吐血)**：這是主要的主訴，且病歷中提到有「large volume (prior to arrival) and multiple episodes melena (黑便)」，這表明是上消化道出血。因此，K92.2 (上消化道出血) 是一個主要的診斷。
2.  **alcoholic cirrhosis (酒精性肝硬化)**：病歷中明確提到患者有酒精性肝硬化，這是一個重要的慢性疾病。因此，K70.30 (酒精性肝硬化，無併發症) 是一個主要的診斷。
3.  **esophageal varices (食道靜脈曲張)**：病歷中提到患者有食道靜脈曲張，且進行了內視鏡下結紮治療。這是一個重要的併發症，因此 I85.00 (食道靜脈曲張，無出血) 是一個主要的診斷。
4.  **multiple episodes melena (多個黑便發作)**：這與上消化道出血相關，是 K92.2 的一個表現。
5.  **lightheadedness (頭暈)**：這是患者主訴的一部分，且在就診時有「transient hypotension (短暫低血壓)」，這表明是低血壓的症狀。因此，R42.1 (頭暈) 是一個次要的診斷。
6.  **transient hypotension (短暫低血壓)**：這是患者就診時的體徵，且與出血相關。因此，R05.9 (未特指的低血壓) 是一個次要的診斷。
7.  **Allergies: Triamterene / Doxycycline / Dyazide**：患者對這些藥物過敏，因此需要編碼這些過敏史。Z88.0 (對利尿劑的過敏史)、Z88.2 (對四環黴素的過敏史)、Z88.3 (對其他抗高血壓藥物的過敏史) 是對這些過敏史的編碼。
8.  **EGD with banding of varices (內視鏡下結紮靜脈曲張)**：這是進行的治療程序，因此 Z49.81 (其他消化道內視鏡檢查後的狀態) 是一個次要的診斷。
9.  **Given these symptoms she presented to ___**：這表明患者因症狀就診，因此 Z72.0 (就診原因) 是一個次要的診斷。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: amnesia** - 患者主訴為失憶，且病史中明確提到「amnesia」和「she would repeat questions and just seemed ""off""」，這表明存在記憶障礙。最直接的編碼是 G44.8 (Other transient cerebral syndromes)。此外，R41.3 (Amnesia) 也適用於描述失憶症狀。
2.  **Mild headache** - 患者自述有輕微頭痛，且頭痛是逐漸發作的，沒有急性 thunderclap 型頭痛。R51.0 (Headache) 是描述頭痛的適當編碼。
3.  **CT head showed no acute process** - 這表明沒有發現急性腦部病變，如腦出血或腦梗塞。因此，不需要編碼這些急性病症。
4.  **Sexual intercourse as a precipitating event** - 患者在性行為後出現症狀，這是一個重要的誘發因素。Y92.0 (Sexual activity) 是描述性活動作為事件原因的適當編碼。
5.  **No known allergies / adverse drug reactions** - 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼相關 ICD-10 編碼。
6.  **Previously healthy woman** - 患者被描述為「previously healthy」，這表明她沒有其他慢性疾病或長期健康問題。因此，不需要編碼其他慢性疾病。
7.  **Denies unusual sexual positions, asphyxiation, etc.** - 患者和丈夫否認有不尋常的性愛姿勢或窒息等行為，這排除了與這些行為相關的特定診斷，如性行為相關的腦損傷 (Y92.0 已經涵蓋了性活動本身，而不是其具體方式)。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   G44.8 (Other transient cerebral syndromes) - 用於描述失憶症狀。
*   R41.3 (Amnesia) - 用於描述失憶症狀。
*   R51.0 (Headache) - 用於描述輕微頭痛。
*   Y92.0 (Sexual activity) - 用於描述性行為作為誘發事件。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION** - 這是主要症狀，但需要找出其根本原因。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Gradual dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and increasing edema X 2 weeks.** - 這些症狀提示心臟功能不全。
3.  **Labs: BNP of 601** - BNP升高是心臟衰竭的強烈指標。
4.  **CXR: Streaky perihilar opacity without lobar consolidation or pleural effusion.** - 胸部X光顯示心臟擴大或肺部淤血，支持心臟衰竭。
5.  **Labs: Cr of 1.3** - 肾功能不全，可能與心臟衰竭相關。

1.  **Hypoxemia (Chief Complaint):** 患者的主要主訴是低氧血症，這是一個症狀。在沒有明確診斷出導致低氧血症的基礎疾病的情況下，R09.02 (Hypoxemia) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **Excisional debridement of decubitus ulcer including skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fat (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這描述了對褥瘡的清創手術，涉及皮膚、皮下組織和脂肪。這表明存在褥瘡，且其程度較為嚴重，需要深度清創。褥瘡的 ICD-10 編碼是 L89.9 (Unspecified pressure ulcer)。由於清創涉及皮下組織和脂肪，這通常表示褥瘡已發展到較深的階段，因此 L89.9 是最合適的選擇。
3.  **Laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid colostomy (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個手術，表明患者有需要結腸造口的腸道問題。最常見的原因是腸道梗阻或穿孔。由於病歷中沒有明確說明具體原因，但考慮到褥瘡和低氧血症，以及需要造口的嚴重性，L53.8 (Other specified intestinal obstruction) 是一個合理的編碼，表示其他特定的腸道阻塞。
4.  **History of Present Illness (HPI) 未提供詳細的病史和診斷。** 由於缺乏進一步的資訊，無法編碼其他潛在的慢性疾病或共病。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Aneurysm (主要診斷)**: 患者因「Aneurysm」就診，且病歷中明確提到「anterior communicating artery aneurysm (前交通動脈瘤)」。這是一個腦動脈瘤，且是手術的主因。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 I67.2 (Unruptured cerebral aneurysm)。雖然病歷中沒有明確說明是破裂或未破裂，但「elective surgical treatment (選擇性手術治療)」通常暗示是未破裂的，因此 I67.2 是最合理的選擇。
2.  **Temporal lobe epilepsy (病史)**: 患者有「temporal lobe epilepsy (顳葉癲癇)」的病史，這是一個慢性神經系統疾病。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 G40.409 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus)。
3.  **Right craniotomy for clipping of ACOMM aneurysm (主要手術)**: 這是一個腦動脈瘤的開顱夾閉術。雖然 ICD-10-PCS 用於編碼手術，但問題是要求 ICD-10 編碼，因此不在此處編碼。
4.  **Allergies: Percocet (過敏史)**: 患者對「Percocet (一種含有對乙醯氨基酚和氧化嗎啡的止痛藥)」過敏。對乙醯氨基酚過敏的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z91.011 (Allergy to acetaminophen)。氧化嗎啡過敏的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z91.012 (Allergy to morphine)。
5.  **Elective surgical treatment (選擇性手術)**: 這是一個就診原因，通常會被編碼為 Z00.01 (Encounter for surgical aftercare)。但由於主要診斷是 I67.2，且手術是針對該診斷的治療，因此 Z00.01 可能不是最必要的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **NSTEMI (Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction)**: 患者有心肌酶升高 (TropI 2.23) 和 ECG 的 ST 段改變，且接受了心導管檢查和冠狀動脈繞道手術，這明確指向心肌梗塞。由於 ECG 沒有 ST 段抬高，因此是 NSTEMI。對應 ICD-10 編碼 I21.4。
2.  **冠狀動脈繞道手術 (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x4, Total arterial revascularization)**: 這是一個主要的外科手術，應編碼為 I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 作為主要診斷，並編碼 Z95.5 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft) 來表示存在繞道。
3.  **高血壓 (HTN)**: 患者有高血壓病史。對應 ICD-10 編碼 I10。
4.  **高脂血症 (HLD)**: 患者有高脂血症病史。對應 ICD-10 編碼 E78.5。

6.  **二尖瓣脫垂 (MVP)**: 患者有二尖瓣脫垂病史。對應 ICD-10 編碼 I34.9。
7.  **焦慮症與恐慌症 (anxiety with panic disorder)**: 患者有焦慮症和恐慌症病史。對應 ICD-10 編碼 F41.9。
8.  **發燒、全身不適、虛弱、噁心嘔吐 (fevers, bodyaches, weakness, n/v)**: 這些是患者就診時的主訴症狀。發燒和全身不適可編碼為 R50.9 (Fever, unspecified) 和 R53.81 (Malaise)。虛弱可編碼為 R53.1 (Weakness)。噁心嘔吐可編碼為 R11.0 (Nausea) 和 R11.1 (Vomiting)。
9.  **疑似肺部感染源頭 (suspected pulmonary source (based on CXR with interstitial thickening in the mid to lower lung fields))**: 這是一個臨床懷疑，但尚未確診。可編碼為 R09.89 (Other symptoms and signs involving the respiratory system)。
10. **疑似蜱傳疾病 (suspected tickborne illness given recent tick bites reported by the patient and multiple ticks found on her body)**: 這是一個臨床懷疑，但尚未確診。可編碼為 R09.89 (Other symptoms and signs involving the respiratory system)。
11. **對類固醇過敏 (Allergies: Androgenic Anabolic Steroid)**: 患者對類固醇過敏。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z91.011 (Allergy to anabolic steroids)。
12. **心導管檢查 (Cardiac catheterization)**: 這是一個診斷程序。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z48.818 (Encounter for other cardiovascular diagnostic procedures)。
13. **心導管檢查結果 (Cardiac catheterization results)**: 檢查結果顯示冠狀動脈疾病，這支持了 I25.10 的診斷。

逐步推理：
1.  **Epigastric pain x1 day, RUQ abdominal pain, N/V, and diarrhea, and syncope:** 這些是主要的急性症狀。由於患者有心臟病史，且在就診時有暈厥，且在就診前有嘔吐和腹瀉，這些症狀可能與急性心臟事件（如心肌梗塞）相關。然而，病歷中並未明確診斷為急性心肌梗塞，且患者有冠狀動脈繞道手術史，因此更合理的解釋是急性心臟事件的症狀，而非單純的胃腸道問題。因此，R07.0 (Epigastric pain) 和 R10.11 (Nausea) 是合理的症狀編碼。R19.7 (Diarrhea) 也是症狀。R55.81 (Syncope) 是暈厥。
2.  **Hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p CABG x3, then redo sternotomy with AVR (Bicor tissue valve):** 這些是重要的既往病史。I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 代表冠狀動脈疾病。Z95.1 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft) 代表冠狀動脈繞道移植的存在。Z95.5 (Presence of artificial heart valve) 代表人工心臟瓣膜的存在。
3.  **DM:** E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 代表第二型糖尿病，無併發症。
4.  **Afib:** I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation) 代表心房顫動。
5.  **Animal dander allergy:** Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified substances) 代表對動物皮屑的過敏。
6.  **Bright red blood in later episodes of diarrhea that she attributes to hemorrhoids:** 這是一個症狀，R10.2 (Hematochezia) 代表便血。
7.  **Lap CCY (Laparoscopic cholecystectomy):** 這是主要的外科手術，因此 ICD-10-PCS 編碼是必要的。由於是腹腔鏡膽囊切除術，且是主要手術，編碼為 0FT00ZZ (Laparoscopic cholecystectomy)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: asymptomatic right carotid stenosis** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是手術的直接原因。因此，I70.0 (Carotid atherosclerosis) 是主要診斷。
2.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIGHT CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY** - 這是一個手術，因此需要一個手術操作碼。02.21 (Endarterectomy, carotid artery) 是最合適的。
3.  **History of Present Illness: MI status post coronary stenting in ___** - 患者有心肌梗塞病史，且已植入支架。I25.2 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with previous myocardial infarction) 用於描述冠狀動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病伴既往心肌梗塞。
4.  **History of Present Illness: serial carotid to post ultrasound since the bruit was heard on physical exam. Most recent ultrasound was in the end of ___ of this year and demonstrated progression of her right-sided stenosis, now measuring 70 to 99%. A subsequent CTA of the neck demonstrated a focal, high-grade ulcerated plaque in the right ICA, measuring approximately 75% by CTA criteria.** - 這些描述強烈支持 I70.0 (Carotid atherosclerosis) 作為主要診斷，並補充了 I70.2 (Carotid artery stenosis) 來描述具體的動脈狹窄。
5.  **History of Present Illness: She was recently seen by her cardiologist, who believes that despite her prior MI, she has a low risk for cardiac complications of a carotid endarterectomy.** - 這表明患者有心臟病史，但目前心臟風險評估為低。I25.2 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with previous myocardial infarction) 已涵蓋此點。
6.  **Allergies: amoxicillin / lisinopril / latex / dairy** - 這些是患者的過敏史，應編碼為 Z88.2 (Allergy to amoxicillin), Z88.3 (Allergy to lisinopril), Z88.8 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances), Z88.9 (Allergy to unspecified drug, medicament and biological substance), Z91.011 (Allergy to latex), Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified substances).
7.  **History of Present Illness: She denies a history of amaurosis fugax or any focal neurological symptoms.** - 患者否認有視覺暫時性失明或任何焦點性神經系統症狀，這表明她目前是無症狀的，因此不編碼任何症狀或併發症。

逐步推理：
1.  **left impacted femoral neck fracture (左股骨頸部壓縮性骨折)**：這是患者就診的主要原因，且已進行左髖關節半關節成形術。根據 ICD-10 編碼，股骨頸部骨折的代碼是 S72.0，而「壓縮性」是骨折的類型，因此應使用 S72.01 (Left femoral neck fracture, closed)。由於患者是「impacted」，這通常表示骨折是閉合性的，因此 S72.01 是最合適的選擇。
2.  **advanced Alzheimer's disease (重度阿茲海默症)**：這是患者的慢性病史，且對其行為和功能有重大影響。根據 ICD-10，阿茲海默症的代碼是 G30.9 (Alzheimer's disease, unspecified)。由於描述為「advanced」，這通常表示為重度，因此 G30.9 是最合適的選擇。
3.  **aphasic (失語症)**：這是患者的一個症狀，與阿茲海默症相關。失語症的 ICD-10 代碼是 R47.0 (Aphasia)。
4.  **minimally interactive (互動極少)**：這描述了患者的行為狀態，通常與阿茲海默症的嚴重程度相關，但這不是一個獨立的診斷，而是對症狀的描述，因此不需要單獨編碼。
5.  **lives in a nursing home (住在護理之家)**：這是一個社會環境因素，不是疾病或症狀，因此不需要編碼。
6.  **mechanical fall (機械性跌倒)**：這是導致骨折的外部原因。根據 ICD-10，跌倒的代碼是 W19 (Unspecified fall)。由於是「mechanical fall」，這通常指非自願的跌倒，因此 W19 是最合適的選擇。
7.  **left hip hemi-arthroplasty (左髖關節半關節成形術)**：這是進行的外科手術，屬於程序碼，不是診斷碼，因此不在此處編碼。

7.  **PMH significant for chronic anemia, osteoporosis, hypertension, ataxia, and recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls** - 這些是病人的既往病史，但病歷中未提及這些病史在本次就診中是主要問題或需要治療的。因此，除非有明確的臨床證據表明這些病史在本次就診中是重要的，否則通常不編碼既往病史。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   C18.7 (Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon) - 主要診斷，也是手術原因。
*   Z85.01 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of colon) - 手術後狀態。
*   Z12.11 (Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of colon) - � 癌症篩查。
*   Z91.011 (Allergy to statins) - 藥物過敏史。
*   Z91.012 (Allergy to calcium channel blockers) - 藥物過敏史。
*   Z91.019 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances) - 藥物過敏史。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: TACE for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**: 這是一個主要的診斷，且病史中明確提到「recent diagnosis of HCC in the setting of no known liver disease」，並有活檢確認。因此，C22.0 (Hepatocellular carcinoma) 是主要診斷。
2.  **PMH: Osteopenia**: 這是患者的既往病史，應編碼為 M81.0 (Osteoporosis)。雖然病歷中寫的是「osteopenia」，但 ICD-10 中沒有單獨的「osteopenia」編碼，最接近的是 M81.0 (Osteoporosis)。
3.  **PMH: Cystic pancreatic lesion seen on imaging c/f likely IPMN**: 這是一個胰臟的囊性病變，被懷疑是胰管內乳頭狀黏液性腫瘤 (IPMN)。病歷中提到「6 mm cystic lesion in the pancreas likely representing sidebranch I PMN」，且「Biopsy performed on ___ confirmed moderately differentiated HCC with fatty changes.」。因此，應編碼為 C25.8 (Other specified malignant neoplasm of pancreas)。
4.  **PMH: Recent diagnosis of HCC in the setting of no known liver disease**: 這表明肝臟本身沒有已知的基礎疾病，因此不需要編碼肝臟的慢性疾病。
5.  **Symptoms: Nausea, right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, poor appetite**: 這些是HCC的症狀，通常由主要診斷 C22.0 覆蓋，除非是獨立的診斷或需要特別關注。病歷中沒有將這些症狀單獨診斷為其他疾病，因此不需額外編碼。
6.  **Abnormal LFTs**: 這是一個實驗室檢查結果，通常不作為主要診斷編碼，除非有特定的肝臟疾病診斷。
7.  **Ultrasound and MRI findings**: 這些是影像學檢查結果，用於支持HCC的診斷，不作為獨立的診斷編碼。
8.  **Biopsy confirmed moderately differentiated HCC with fatty changes**: 這進一步確認了HCC的診斷，並提供了細節，但不改變主要診斷碼。
9.  **Preparation for TACE: Planning arteriogram and injection of Technetium**: 這些是手術準備步驟，不作為診斷編碼。
10. **Most recently noted right upper quadrant, right rib cage, and right scapular discomfort**: 這些是HCC的症狀，通常由主要診斷 C22.0 覆蓋。

逐步推理：
1.  **HPV+ R neck mass (HPV陽性右頸部腫塊)**：這是一個頭頸部的腫瘤，且為HPV陽性。由於未明確指出是惡性或良性，但通常在這種臨床情境下，頸部腫塊若未進一步說明且在耳鼻喉科就診，通常會假設為惡性。因此，最合理的編碼是 C32.9 (Malignant neoplasm of larynx, unspecified) 來代表喉部的惡性腫瘤，並搭配 Z87.89 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm) 來表示HPV陽性的病史。
2.  **Allergies: Ragweed (過敏： ragweed)**：患者對 ragweed 有過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.012 (Allergy to plant pollen)。
3.  **Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY (科別：耳鼻喉科)**：這是一個就診科別，通常不編碼為 ICD-10 編碼，除非有特定的診斷或原因需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Mechanical fall with b/l rib fractures and left femur fracture.** 這描述了主要的外傷事件。由於是從輪椅跌倒，屬於機械性跌倒，應編碼為 W19.XXXA (Other specified accidental falls, initial encounter)。跌倒的環境是「其他未指明的場所」，因此使用 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of external cause)。
2.  **b/l rib fx's, mostly L lower rib fx's.** 這表示雙側肋骨骨折，主要在左下肋骨。應編碼為 S22.211A (Fracture of left 1st rib, initial encounter) 和 S22.212A (Fracture of left 2nd rib, initial encounter)。由於是「主要在左下肋骨」，可能需要更精確的編碼，但 S22.211A 和 S22.212A 已涵蓋左側肋骨骨折。
3.  **left femur fracture.** 這表示左股骨骨折。應編碼為 S72.001A (Unspecified fracture of left femoral shaft, initial encounter for closed fracture)。
4.  **hx of osteogenesis imperfecta.** 這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼為 Q87.0 (Osteogenesis imperfecta)。
5.  **dwarfism.** 這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼為 Q37.9 (Short stature, unspecified)。
6.  **multiple falls.** 這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼為 Z87.898 (Personal history of other specified conditions)。
7.  **-LOC.** 這表示跌倒後失去意識，應編碼為 R41.82 (Loss of consciousness)。
8.  **-headstrike.** 這表示頭部受到撞擊，應編碼為 S00.00XA (Unspecified head injury, initial encounter)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting, panic attacks** - 這些是患者就診的主要症狀。
    *   **Nausea and vomiting (N/V)**: 患者有持續的惡心和嘔吐，且在 ED 接受了 IVF、Zofran、Compazine 和 IV morphine 治療。這直接對應 ICD-10 編碼 R1110 (Nausea) 和 R1111 (Vomiting)。
    *   **Panic attacks**: 患者有頻繁的恐慌發作，並描述為「sensations of impending doom」。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 F410 (Panic disorder (adult))。
2.  **History of Present Illness (HPI) details**:
    *   **Oxycodone use and discontinuation**: 患者因喉嚨痛服用 Oxycodone，後因恐慌發作停藥。停藥後恐慌發作改善，但出現 N/V。這表明 N/V 可能是停藥後的戒斷症狀。
        *   **Opioid withdrawal**: 患者停用 Oxycodone 後出現 N/V，這符合阿片類藥物戒斷的症狀。對應 ICD-10 編碼 F11210 (Opioid dependence, uncomplicated) 和 F11211 (Opioid dependence, in remission)。F11210 表示當前的依賴，F11211 表示戒斷後的緩解期。
    *   **Adverse drug reaction to oxycodone**: 患者因喉嚨痛無法吞咽 Ativan 舌下片，這表明 Oxycodone 的使用導致了喉嚨痛，進而影響了 Ativan 的使用。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 T405X5A (Adverse effect of other opioid analgesics, initial encounter)。
    *   **Cough**: 患者有間歇性咳嗽，自 ___ 以來。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 R059 (Unspecified cough)。
3.  **Past Medical History (PMH)**:
    *   **Ulcerative colitis**: 患者有潰瘍性結腸炎病史。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 K519 (Ulcerative colitis, unspecified)。
    *   **Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left submandibular gland s/p complete surgical resection and completed adjuvant chemoradiation**: 患者有左側下頜下腺腺樣囊性癌病史，已進行完全手術切除和輔助化放療。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z8581 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of other specified sites)。
4.  **Other relevant information**:
    *   **Throat pain**: 患者因喉嚨痛服用 Oxycodone，這導致了 Ativan 舌下片無法吞咽。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 R070 (Pharyngitis)。
    *   **Restlessness**: 患者有增加的焦躁不安，這可能是 N/V 的症狀之一，也可能是恐慌發作的表現。這對應 ICD-10 編碼 R458 (Restlessness)。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **RUL lung nodule (right upper lobe lung nodule):**  This is the primary reason for the patient's presentation and the reason for the VATS RUL lobectomy.  Since the nodule is concerning for primary lung cancer, and the procedure is a lobectomy, this strongly suggests a malignant nodule.  The most specific ICD-10 code for a malignant lung nodule is **C34.11 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, right lung)**.
2.  **Traumatic blunt injury to the left chest:**  This is a past medical history that led to the discovery of the lung nodule.  The injury itself is not the reason for the current presentation, but it's a relevant past event.  The appropriate code for a history of a traumatic injury is **Y93.89 (Other specified history of injury)**.
3.  **Incidentally identified:**  This is an important detail indicating that the nodule was not the primary reason for the initial trauma evaluation.  It's a finding that led to further investigation.
4.  **PET/CT obtained:**  This is a diagnostic procedure, not a diagnosis itself.
5.  **PFTs and PATs:**  These are also diagnostic procedures, not diagnoses.
6.  **Follow-up after PET/CT:**  This is a reason for the current visit, but not a diagnosis.
7.  **No change since recent visit:**  This is a patient-reported status, not a diagnosis.
8.  **Denies any new symptoms:**  This is a patient-reported status, not a diagnosis.
9.  **Pain on her left side where she fell feels much improved and seems to be resolving well:**  This is a patient-reported status, not a diagnosis.
10. **Denies any chest pain, difficulty breathing, cough, fevers, chills, sweats:**  These are all patient-reported negative symptoms, not diagnoses.

总结出最合理的編碼集合：
*   C34.11 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, right lung) - Primary reason for the lobectomy and the most specific code for the lung nodule.
*   Y93.89 (Other specified history of injury) - History of the traumatic injury that led to the discovery of the nodule.

1.  **Volume overload (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，表現為下肢水腫和低氧血症。這通常與心力衰竭相關，因此會編碼心力衰竭的相關 ICD-10 編碼。
2.  **HFpEF (EF55%) (History of Present Illness):** 患者有射血分數保留型心力衰竭 (HFpEF) 的病史，且目前有體積超負荷的症狀。I425 是心力衰竭 (不論射血分數) 的主要編碼。
3.  **Severe PAH with RV systolic dysfunction (History of Present Illness):** 患者有嚴重肺動脈高壓伴右心室收縮功能障礙。I270 是肺動脈高壓的編碼，I278.6 是右心室功能不全的編碼。

5.  **Rate controlled permanent atrial fibrillation (Past Medical History):** 患者有永久性心房顫動，且已控制心率。I482 是永久性心房顫動的編碼。
6.  **Rivaroxaban (Past Medical History):** 患者正在服用利伐沙班，這是一種抗凝血劑。Z7901 是抗凝血劑使用狀態的編碼。
7.  **Lower extremity edema (History of Present Illness):** 患者有下肢水腫，這是心力衰竭的症狀。R600 是水腫的編碼。
8.  **Dyspnea (History of Present Illness):** 患者有呼吸困難，這是心力衰竭和肺動脈高壓的症狀。R0602 是呼吸困難的編碼。
9.  **Recent 5lb weight gain (History of Present Illness):** 患者有近期體重增加，這是心力衰竭的症狀。R630 是體重增加的編碼。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chiari I type malformation with approximately 2cm tonsillar herniation and compression of the pontomedullary junction at C1 and the occiput:** 這是病人的主要診斷，也是導致其症狀（頸部、肩部疼痛、壓力、左臂和胸部麻木）的原因。ICD-10 編碼 Q03.8 是「其他先天性腦脊髓膜膨出」，適用於 Chiari 異常，尤其是當其導致症狀或需要手術時。
2.  **Shoulder and neck pain/pressure:** 這是病人的主訴，也是 Chiari 異常的症狀。ICD-10 編碼 G99.89 是「其他神經系統症狀」，適用於未被更特定編碼涵蓋的症狀。
3.  **Left arm numbness:** 這是病人的另一個主訴，也是 Chiari 異常的症狀。ICD-10 編碼 G99.89 同樣適用於此。
4.  **Chest numbness:** 這是病人的另一個主訴，也是 Chiari 異常的症狀。ICD-10 編碼 G99.89 同樣適用於此。
5.  **Symptoms exacerbated with coughing and sneezing:** 這描述了症狀的誘發因素，但本身不是一個獨立的診斷或症狀，因此不需要單獨編碼。
6.  **Suboccipital craniotomy for chiari malformation decompression:** 這是病人的主要手術，但 ICD-10 編碼主要用於診斷，除非特別要求，否則通常不編碼手術。
7.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 這表示病人沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Abdominal pain and nausea**: 這些是主要的主訴，但通常不作為主要診斷編碼，除非是未明確診斷的症狀。在本例中，患者被診斷為急性闌尾炎，因此這些症狀是闌尾炎的表現，不需單獨編碼。
2.  **Acute appendicitis**: 這是患者就診的主要原因，且已進行了闌尾切除手術。因此，主要診斷應為急性闌尾炎，編碼為 K35.80 (Acute appendicitis, unspecified)。
3.  **Obesity**: 患者有肥胖病史，這是一個重要的共病，編碼為 E66.9 (Obesity, unspecified)。
4.  **Abnormal LFTs (likely related to hepatic steatosis as noted on CT)**: 患者有肝功能異常，且CT顯示脂肪肝。脂肪肝是肝功能異常的潛在原因，因此應編碼脂肪肝。肝功能異常本身是脂肪肝的表現，因此編碼為 E85.50 (Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, unspecified)。
5.  **Spicy food and Popeye's chicken**: 這些是導致急性闌尾炎的潛在原因，屬於環境因素。應編碼為 Y92.019 (Other specified place of occurrence of external cause) 來表示食物相關的環境因素。
6.  **Amoxicillin (unknown dose) brought from ___**: 患者服用了阿莫西林，這是一個藥物使用史。應編碼為 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of antibiotic) 來表示長期或當前使用抗生素。
7.  **Past medical history of abnormal LFTs (likely related to hepatic steatosis as noted on CT)**: 這已經在 E85.50 中涵蓋。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Post-TACE Admission** - 這是一個就診原因，不是診斷，通常不直接編碼，但會影響選擇相關的診斷和程序碼。
2.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TACE segment 4A on ___** - 這是一個重要的手術程序，應編碼為 ICD-10-PCS 編碼。TACE (Transarterial Chemoembolization) 是一種介入性治療，用於肝癌。根據 ICD-10-PCS，這應編碼為 0W7N3ZZ (Insertion of drug and/or other substance into liver, percutaneous approach, diagnostic)。雖然 ""drug and/or other substance"" 通常指化學藥物，但 TACE 通常包含化學藥物和栓塞物質，因此此編碼是合理的。
3.  **History of Present Illness: multifocal HCC s/p multiple (___) TACE procedure for liver lesions** - 這明確指出患者有肝細胞癌 (HCC)。HCC 的 ICD-10 編碼是 C22.0 (Malignant neoplasm of liver)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: history of HTN, HLD** - 這些是患者的慢性病史。高血壓 (HTN) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。高脂血症 (HLD) 的 ICD-10 編碼是 E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: prior right hepatectomy** - 這表示患者有肝臟切除術的病史。肝臟切除術的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified surgical procedure)。
6.  **History of Present Illness: Allergies: Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics)** - 這表示患者對磺胺類抗生素過敏。磺胺類藥物過敏的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z91.013 (Allergy to sulfonamide drug)。
7.  **History of Present Illness: Of note her first two post-tace procedures were complicated by flu-like symptoms, confusion, lethargy, fatigue, dyspnea. Her recent ones have been much smoother.** - 這描述了患者過去的不良反應，但目前沒有提到這些症狀。因此，這些是過去的不良事件，不是當前的診斷。如果這些症狀是當前就診的原因，則需要編碼，但根據病史描述，這些是過去的不良事件，且患者目前沒有這些症狀，因此不編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   C22.0 (Malignant neoplasm of liver) - 肝細胞癌
*   I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) - 高血壓
*   E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified) - 高脂血症
*   Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified surgical procedure) - 肝臟切除術病史

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: SBO (Small Bowel Obstruction)**: 患者主訴為小腸阻塞，且病史中明確提到「recurrent SBO」和「severe abdominal pain after dinner that felt like his prior obstruction. He has not had any flatus or BM since and feels distended.」，這直接指向小腸阻塞。因此，編碼 K56.60 (Unspecified intestinal obstruction, not elsewhere classified) 是最合適的。
2.  **History of T cell lymphoma of the small bowel s/p 6 cycles of chemo and autologous stem cell transplant**: 患者有小腸T細胞淋巴瘤病史，且已接受化療和自體幹細胞移植。這表示他目前處於癌症的後期階段，且有相關的後遺症。因此，編碼 Z85.71 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of digestive system) 用於表示個人癌症病史。此外，Z90.11 (History of autologous bone marrow transplant) 用於表示自體骨髓移植史。
3.  **PET scan 3 days prior to presentation that demonstrated no residual signals suggestive of cancer**: 這表明目前沒有癌症活動的證據，因此不需要編碼活動性癌症。
4.  **Being worked up for severe hypertension and is due for adrenal vein sampling next week**: 患者正在接受嚴重高血壓的評估，且將進行腎上腺靜脈採樣。這表示高血壓是當前正在評估的問題。因此，編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 用於表示高血壓。
5.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions**: 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應，因此不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: right upper quadrant abdominal pain**：這是患者就診的主要原因，但病史中描述疼痛最初在右下腹，後來轉移到中腹部，且最終診斷為膽囊炎。因此，R1011 (Right upper quadrant pain) 是一個合理的症狀編碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness: one week history of malaise and non specific abdominal pain**：這描述了患者整體的不適和腹痛，R538 (Malaise) 可以編碼。
3.  **History of Present Illness: loose bowel movement today**：這是一個具體的症狀，K590 (Diarrhea) 是正確的編碼。
4.  **History of Present Illness: abdominal pain for the last week. It originally started in the right lower quadrant then went to the mid abdomen.**：這描述了腹痛的病程，R1011 (Right upper quadrant pain) 已經涵蓋了右上腹痛，但右下腹痛 (R1001) 也應該被編碼，因為這是疼痛的起始位置。
5.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: open cholecystectomy**：這表明患者接受了膽囊切除術，這通常是由於膽囊炎或膽囊結石引起的。K8000 (Cholelithiasis with cholecystitis without perforation) 是膽囊結石伴膽囊炎的編碼，這通常會導致膽囊切除術。
6.  **History of Present Illness: decreased appetite**：這是一個具體的症狀，R631 (Anorexia) 是正確的編碼。
7.  **History of Present Illness: denies any nausea or vomiting**：患者否認嘔吐，因此不需要編碼嘔吐。
8.  **History of Present Illness: denies increase pain following meals**：患者否認進食後疼痛加劇，這與膽囊炎的典型表現 (進食後疼痛加劇) 不符，但這並不排除膽囊炎，因為疼痛可能在不同時間表現不同。
9.  **History of Present Illness: denies prior abdominal pain following meals**：患者否認進食後腹痛，這與膽囊炎的典型表現 (進食後疼痛加劇) 不符，但這並不排除膽囊炎，因為疼痛可能在不同時間表現不同。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   R1011 (Right upper quadrant pain)：主要的腹痛症狀。
*   R1001 (Right lower quadrant pain)：腹痛的起始位置。
*   R538 (Malaise)：整體不適。
*   K590 (Diarrhea)：腹瀉。

逐步推理：
1.  **s/p fall (slip on ice)**: 患者因滑倒導致骨折，這是導致骨折的直接原因。因此，應編碼為 Y92.011 (Slip on ice as the external cause of the injury)。
2.  **right distal femoral condylar fracture likely chronic postsurgical**: 右股骨遠端髁部骨折，且被描述為慢性術後。這是一個骨折診斷，應編碼為 S72.311A (Fracture of right distal femur, initial encounter for closed fracture)。由於是慢性術後，可能需要額外的編碼來表示慢性狀態，但主要骨折診斷已足夠。
3.  **left bimalleolar fracture**: 左側雙踝骨折，應編碼為 S92.811A (Fracture of left ankle, initial encounter for closed fracture)。
4.  **afib (atrial fibrillation)**: 患者有心房顫動病史，應編碼為 I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)。
5.  **HFrEF (Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction)**: 患者有心臟衰竭病史，應編碼為 I50.22 (Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction)。
6.  **mechanical fall (slip on ice)**: 滑倒導致的機械性跌倒，這是導致骨折的外部原因，已編碼為 Y92.011。
7.  **pain not controlled with PO pain medication regimen**: 患者因疼痛控制不佳而入院，這是一個主要的入院原因，應編碼為 R51.1 (Pain)。
8.  **admitted to medicine for pain control prior to discharge to acute rehab**: 患者因疼痛控制不佳而入院，這是一個主要的入院原因，應編碼為 R51.1 (Pain)。
9.  **lisinopril allergy**: 患者對利辛普利過敏，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors)。
10. **morphine allergy**: 患者對嗎啡過敏，應編碼為 Z91.012 (Allergy to morphine)。
11. **discharge to acute rehab**: 患者將被轉送至急性康復中心，這是一個轉運目的地，應編碼為 Z87.891 (Patient to be transferred to acute rehabilitation center)。

1.  **RA with ILD on pred and mycophenolate:** 這表示患者有類風濕性關節炎 (RA) 並伴有間質性肺病 (ILD)。RA 是 R77.1，ILD 是 J84.14。
2.  **COPD:** 慢性阻塞性肺病，編碼為 J44.9。
3.  **OSA:** 阻塞性睡眠呼吸中止症，編碼為 G47.33。
4.  **CAD, s/p MI an stents:** 冠狀動脈疾病，心肌梗塞後，有支架植入。心肌梗塞後狀態是 I25.2，冠狀動脈疾病是 I25.10。
5.  **PE on xarelto:** 肺栓塞，正在服用抗凝劑。肺栓塞是 I26.9，抗凝劑使用是 Z79.01。
6.  **pAF:** 慢性心房顫動，編碼為 I48.91。
7.  **nausea and diaphoresis, pre-syncope:** 這些是本次就診的主要症狀。惡心和嘔吐是 R11.0，虛弱是 R53.1，潮濕是 R09.2，預暈是 R55.81。
8.  **Episode of feeling nausea, diaphoresis, and reportedly looked pale:** 這些是預暈的表現，已包含在 R55.81 和 R11.0 中。
9.  **Episode of vomitus with scant clear sputum:** 嘔吐是 R11.10。
10. **Reports of the patient appearing to ""follow asleep"" immediately afterwards, but patient denies any LOC or syncope:** 這描述了預暈的狀態，已包含在 R55.81 中。
11. **Of note, patient was hospitalized in ___ for evaluation of pre-syncope when he had several episodes of weakness. Work-up at that time included TTE without structural cause of syncope, negative carotid US, and telemetry with episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia which did not correspond with symptoms.** 這表明患者有預暈的病史，且心臟檢查未發現結構性原因，但有心律不整。這支持了預暈的診斷 (R55.81) 和心律不整 (I49.89)。
12. **In the ED, initial vitals were: T 96.8, HR 89, BP 126/53, RR 20, Pox 95% on 5L nc:** 這些是就診時的體徵，但通常不單獨編碼，除非有特定的異常值需要關注。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Toe ulcer** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，且病歷中提到「non-healing chronic right toe wound」，這是一個慢性潰瘍。因此，應編碼為 R24.81 (Other chronic ulcer of skin)。
2.  **Past Medical History: Stroke** - 患者有中風病史，但病歷中未提及中風的具體類型或後遺症。因此，編碼為 I69.9 (Unspecified sequela of cerebrovascular disease)。
3.  **Past Medical History: Type II DM** - 患者有第二型糖尿病，且病歷中提到「type II DM」。因此，編碼為 E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。
4.  **Past Medical History: Hypertension** - 患者有高血壓病史。因此，編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
5.  **Past Medical History: Tobacco abuse** - 患者有菸癮。因此，編碼為 F17.210 (Nicotine dependence, uncomplicated)。
6.  **Non-healing chronic right toe wound with purulent discharge and concern for osteomyelitis** - 患者有慢性潰瘍，且有膿性分泌物，並懷疑骨髓炎。雖然X光未顯示骨髓炎，但MRI顯示「non-displaced comminuted fracture of the distal aspect of the distal phalanx with associated osseous edema」，這表明存在骨損傷。因此，應編碼為 L03.113 (Cellulitis of right toe) 代表膿性感染，以及 M89.813 (Other specified disorders of bone and cartilage, right toe) 代表骨損傷。
7.  **MRI findings: non-displaced comminuted fracture of the distal aspect of the distal phalanx with associated osseous edema** - 這是一個骨折，因此應編碼為 S19.813A (Unspecified fracture of other parts of right toe, initial encounter for closed fracture)。
8.  **Claudication of right calf when walking short distances that resolves with rest** - 這是一個間歇性跛行症狀，與下肢動脈疾病相關。因此，編碼為 I70.209 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities, unspecified extremity, without gangrene)。
9.  **Composite bypass grafting of right femoral to above knee with PTFE graft and right above knee to posterior tibial artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein angioscopy and popliteal endarterectomy of the right thigh** - 這些是手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼為 ICD-10 診斷碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: multiple lung nodules** - 這是一個主要的症狀，但通常會有更明確的診斷或原因。在病史中，PET掃描顯示與整個胸膜的高FDG攝取，以及多個肺結節，這提示存在惡性腫瘤的可能。由於患者有結腸癌病史，且PET掃描顯示全身多處FDG高攝取，最合理的解釋是結腸癌的轉移。因此，肺結節是結腸癌轉移的表現，應編碼為轉移性惡性腫瘤。
2.  **History of Present Illness: presumptive tuberculosis** - 患者正在接受疑似結核病的治療。這是一個重要的診斷，應編碼為結核病的未明確診斷。
3.  **History of Present Illness: history of colon cancer** - 患者有結腸癌病史，且PET掃描顯示全身多處FDG高攝取，這強烈提示結腸癌的轉移。因此，結腸癌本身是原發性惡性腫瘤，應編碼為結腸癌。
4.  **PET scan showed intense FDG uptake associated with the entire pleura of the left hemithorax with focal more intense regions of uptake with possible soft tissue nodularity as well as intensely FDG-avid lymphadenopathy including left supraclavicular, mediastinal, internal mammary and upper abdominal lymph nodes and intensely FDG-avid infiltration of the mesentery with nodularity and thickening of the peritoneum.** - 這些發現支持結腸癌的轉移，包括胸膜、淋巴結、腹膜等部位。因此，應編碼為轉移性惡性腫瘤，並指定轉移部位。
5.  **Chest CT on ___ revealed multiple new pulmonary nodules, largest in the right upper lobe measuring 11 mm.** - 這進一步支持肺部存在轉移性病灶。
6.  **___ guided biopsy on ___ was non-diagnostic.** - 穿刺活檢未明確診斷，但PET掃描和病史已足夠支持結腸癌轉移的診斷。
7.  **Referred for possible VATS biopsy.** - 這是一個即將進行的程序，不是診斷。
8.  **Today, pt reports minimal respiratory symptoms. ___ cough, hemoptysis, SOB at rest. Denies dyspnea when walking on a flat surface, but is unable to walk up 2 flights of stairs without shortness of breath.** - 這些是症狀，但主要的診斷是惡性腫瘤。
9.  **Has had bilateral jaw swelling x ___ years, no known cause.** - 這是一個長期存在的症狀，但未明確診斷，且不是主要的診斷。
10. **Has been feeling weak and fatigued, can't walk very far. Has leg cramping. Also occasional chest pain with exertion.** - 這些是症狀，但主要的診斷是惡性腫瘤。
11. **Daughter reports he is on antibiotics for an abdominal infection (?).** - 這是一個可能的併發症，但未明確診斷，且不是主要的診斷。
12. **Has had 2 recent thoracenteses for pleural effusions.** - 這是一個症狀或併發症，但主要的診斷是惡性腫瘤。
13. **Is severely anemic and required a transfusion in ___ likely be starting epoetin injections.** - 這是一個併發症，應編碼為嚴重貧血。
14. **Allergies: eggplant** - 這是一個過敏史，應編碼為對茄子的過敏。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   **C18.9** - 結腸未明確部位的惡性腫瘤 (原發性惡性腫瘤)
*   **C79.89** - 其他未明確部位的轉移性惡性腫瘤 (轉移性惡性腫瘤)
*   **A16.9** - 結核病，未明確診斷 (疑似結核病)

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Dizziness** - 患者主訴為眩暈，且病史中描述為「severe dizziness」，且與BPPV相關。因此，H81.01 (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) 是主要診斷。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Vomiting twice in the emergency room** - 患者在急診室嘔吐兩次，這是一個症狀。因此，R11.10 (Vomiting, unspecified) 是一個症狀編碼。
3.  **History of Present Illness: Nauseous** - 患者感到非常噁心，這是一個症狀。因此，R11.0 (Nausea) 是一個症狀編碼。
4.  **History of Present Illness: Systolic pressure reportedly >200** - 患者血壓高達200以上，這是一個高血壓危象。因此，I16.0 (Hypertensive crisis) 是一個診斷編碼。
5.  **PMH: HTN (Hypertension)** - 患者有高血壓病史。因此，I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是一個慢性病史編碼。
6.  **PMH: HLD (Hyperlipidemia)** - 患者有高血脂病史。因此，E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified) 是一個慢性病史編碼。
7.  **PMH: T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus)** - 患者有第二型糖尿病病史。因此，E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 是一個慢性病史編碼。
8.  **History of Present Illness: Driving a car on the morning of ___ without issue, though he did have to steady himself before standing up to get out of the car** - 患者在駕車時沒有問題，但下車時需要扶穩，這表明有跌倒的風險。因此，R29.6 (Risk of falling) 是一個風險因素編碼。
9.  **History of Present Illness: Sister checked his blood pressure this morning, found the systolic pressure to be reportedly >200, and sent the patient to the ED** - 患者因高血壓危象就醫，這是一個就醫原因。因此，Z79.5 (Encounter for hypertension) 是一個就醫原因編碼。

1.  **Chief Complaint: Found down** - 這是一個症狀，但通常會被更具體的診斷所取代。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Found down on the bathroom floor by his wife earlier today. It's unclear how long he was down, as he was last seen normal on ___. Per wife, his neighbors had heard him moving around the apartment on ___ (he lives separately from his wife), and she can see from her phone records that no phone calls were made after ___. Per EMS report, on transport to ___, he had a seizure with R upper gaze deviation and tremors in all extremities.** - 這描述了患者被發現倒地，並在運送途中發生癲癇發作。這表明患者可能在倒地後發生了癲癇發作，導致其被發現倒地。因此，癲癇發作 (G40.909) 是一個重要的診斷。
3.  **History of Present Illness: ETOH use disorder and hx of complicated withdrawals in the past, who was found down on the bathroom floor by his wife earlier today.** - 患者有酒精使用障礙，且有複雜戒斷史。這表明酒精使用障礙是其主要的慢性疾病。
4.  **History of Present Illness: He's been in multiple inpatient detox programs, and has been hospitalized in the past for complicated withdrawals (unclear if he's had seizures before, but has had multiple withdrawals complicated by hallucinations).** - 患者有複雜戒斷史，且過去的戒斷曾伴有幻覺。這表明酒精戒斷綜合症 (F10.2) 是其重要的診斷。
5.  **Allergies: Keflex** - 患者對 Keflex (頭孢氨苄) 過敏，這是一個重要的過敏史。
6.  **History of Present Illness: No other illicit drug use. Mood has been stable. Wife has low concern for SI or other tox ingestions.** - 患者無其他非法藥物使用史，情緒穩定，妻子對自殺意圖或其他毒物攝入的擔憂較低。

逐步推理：
1.  **BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia):** 這是患者就診的主要原因之一，且是前列腺切除術的直接原因。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 N40.1。
2.  **BOO (Bladder Outlet Obstruction):** 這是 BPH 的常見併發症，也是患者就診的另一個主要原因。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 R33.8。
3.  **Multiple episodes of urinary retention with:** 這描述了 BPH/BOO 的嚴重程度和症狀。對應的 ICD-10 編碼是 R33.8 (Bladder outlet obstruction) 和 R33.8 (Urinary retention)。但由於 R33.8 已經涵蓋了 BOO，而尿瀦留是 BOO 的一個症狀，因此只需編碼 R33.8 一次。
4.  **Prostatectomy Simple Robotic Laparoscopic:** 這是一個手術程序，對應的 ICD-10-PCS 編碼是 0V7B0ZZ (Laparoscopic simple prostatectomy)。但由於問題僅要求 ICD-10 編碼，因此不包含此編碼。
5.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 這表示患者沒有已知的過敏史，因此不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Peripheral Vascular Disease (Chief Complaint):** 患者因「外周動脈疾病」就診，且病史中提到「PAD (Peripheral Arterial Disease)」，這是一個主要的慢性疾病。因此，I70.20 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities without gangrene) 是一個合適的編碼。
2.  **Left Toe Injury that has failed to heal and has become infected:** 患者左腳趾受傷，未能癒合且已感染。這表明存在「壞疽」。I70.26 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities with gangrene) 比 I70.20 更具體，因為它包含了壞疽。
3.  **Noninvasive vascular studies suggestive of a diminished toe pressure on the left:** 這進一步支持了左下肢外周動脈疾病，特別是與壞疽相關的。I70.26 仍然適用。
4.  **CAD and NSTEMI s/p recent PTCA and DES to RCA:** 患者有冠狀動脈疾病 (CAD) 和非 ST 段抬高型心肌梗死 (NSTEMI) 的病史，並接受了 PTCA 和 DES。I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 用於描述 CAD。I25.2 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris) 用於描述 NSTEMI。
5.  **Paroxysmal AFib (not on warfarin):** 患者有陣發性心房顫動，但未服用華法林。I48.0 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) 是正確的編碼。
6.  **HTN:** 患者有高血壓。I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是正確的編碼。
7.  **ESRD on HD TTS through L AVF:** 患者有終末期腎病，正在進行血液透析，通過左側動脈靜脈瘻管 (AVF)。N18.6 (End-stage renal disease) 用於 ESRD。Z99.2 (Dependence on renal dialysis) 用於血液透析依賴。Z95.81 (Presence of arteriovenous fistula) 用於 AVF。
8.  **Allergies: Penicillins / ACE inhibitor / diltiazem / Norvasc / NSAIDS (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug) / Dilaudid:** 患者有多種藥物過敏史。Z88.0 (Allergy to penicillin) 用於青黴素過敏。Z88.2 (Allergy to ACE inhibitor) 用於 ACE 抑制劑過敏。Z88.3 (Allergy to calcium channel blocker) 用於鈣通道阻滯劑 (diltiazem/Norvasc) 過敏。Z88.6 (Allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) 用於非類固醇抗炎藥 (NSAIDs) 過敏。Z88.8 (Allergy to other specified drug, medicament and biological substance) 用於其他指定藥物 (Dilaudid) 過敏。

逐步推理：
1.  **Leg swelling and pain with clear discharge:** 這些症狀描述了急性下肢問題，最符合的是「急性蜂窩性組織炎」(L03.111)。由於是左下肢，且有膿液排出，因此選擇 L03.111 (Acute cellulitis of left lower leg with purulent discharge)。
2.  **HFrEF (Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction):** 這是一個慢性心臟疾病，對應 I5022 (Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) with right heart failure)。由於病歷中提到「up-trending Cr」，這表明心臟衰竭可能導致腎功能惡化，因此選擇包含右心衰竭的 I5022。
3.  **CHB s/p PPM (Complete Heart Block with Pacemaker):** 這是一個慢性心臟節律障礙，對應 I445 (Complete atrioventricular block)。由於患者已植入起搏器，因此不需要額外編碼起搏器本身。
4.  **IDDM (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus):** 這是一個慢性糖尿病，對應 E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。雖然患者是「insulin-dependent」，但 ICD-10 中 E119 通常用於 2 型糖尿病，而 E109 用於 1 型糖尿病。由於病歷中未明確指出是 1 型，且 IDDM 通常指 2 型，因此選擇 E119。
5.  **Cerebrovascular accident:** 這是一個慢性神經系統疾病，對應 I6989 (Other sequela of cerebrovascular disease)。由於是「sequela」，表示是中風後的後遺症。
6.  **Urinary retention:** 這是一個泌尿系統症狀，對應 R339 (Urinary retention, unspecified)。
7.  **Severe dementia (resides in a locked memory unit):** 這是一個慢性神經系統疾病，對應 F03 (Unspecified dementia)。
8.  **Allergies: Amoxicillin / Fentanyl / Lasix:** 這些是患者的過敏史，對應 Z91011 (Allergy to penicillin), Z91012 (Allergy to fentanyl), Z91013 (Allergy to lasix)。
9.  **Admitted ___ for NSTEMI:** 這是一個過去的急性心臟事件，對應 I252 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery) 作為慢性心臟病的基礎，以及 Z8671 (Personal history of acute myocardial infarction) 作為 NSTEMI 的個人病史。
10. **Torsemide, spironolactone, and lisinopril were discontinued in the setting of up-trending Cr:** 這表明患者有腎功能惡化，對應 N185 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5)。由於是「up-trending Cr」，這表示腎功能惡化，因此選擇 N185。
11. **Severe dementia (resides in a locked memory unit):** 這是一個慢性神經系統疾病，對應 R418 (Other cognitive disorders) 作為「locked memory unit」的描述，表示需要監護的認知障礙。

逐步推理：
1.  **SBO (Small Bowel Obstruction):** 患者主訴和診斷都明確指出是機械性小腸阻塞，且CT掃描也證實了這一點。因此，K56.61 (Mechanical intestinal obstruction, small intestine) 是主要診斷。
2.  **Vomiting:** 患者有持續嘔吐的症狀，且嘔吐物為深棕色，懷疑是糞便樣物質。這支持了小腸阻塞的診斷，但也可單獨編碼。R11.10 (Vomiting, unspecified) 是合適的。
3.  **Nausea:** 患者有噁心的症狀。R11.0 (Nausea) 是合適的。
4.  **Constipation:** 患者最初認為自己是便秘，並嘗試服用 prune juice。這與小腸阻塞的症狀相關，但也可單獨編碼。R14.3 (Constipation) 是合適的。
5.  **Chills:** 患者有發冷的症狀。R50.9 (Chills, unspecified) 是合適的。
6.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 患者沒有已知的過敏史或不良藥物反應。Z88.8 (Allergy status, unspecified) 通常用於有過敏史的患者，但在此情況下，患者沒有過敏史，因此不需要編碼。
7.  **History of Laparotomy and Excision of L Perirenal Mass (Benign Lesion on Path):** 患者有2個月的病史，表明他有過腹腔鏡手術和左腎周腫塊切除術。這是一個重要的既往病史，應編碼。Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified surgical procedure) 是合適的。
8.  **Benign Lesion on Path:** 腫塊被病理證實為良性。這是一個既往病史，應編碼。Z85.81 (Personal history of other benign neoplasm) 是合適的。
9.  **Mechanical Intestinal Obstruction with a Single Transition Point:** 這進一步描述了小腸阻塞的性質，但 K56.61 已經涵蓋了機械性小腸阻塞，因此不需要額外編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：K56.61, R11.10, R11.0, R14.3, R50.9, Z87.891, Z85.81。

1.  **Abdominal pain (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要症狀，應編碼為 R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified)。
2.  **Pancreatic mass (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，且進行了 EUS with biopsy of mass，這表明存在一個需要進一步評估的胰臟病變。由於沒有明確的惡性或良性診斷，最合理的編碼是 R1989 (Other specified symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen)。這是一個用於描述尚未明確診斷的消化系統症狀和體徵的編碼。
3.  **EUS with biopsy of mass (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個診斷程序，本身不是診斷，因此不直接對應 ICD-10 編碼。但其結果（胰臟病變）已由 R1989 涵蓋。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **nausea, vomiting**: 患者主訴為噁心和嘔吐，這直接對應於 K59.00 (Nausea and vomiting, unspecified)。
2.  **ileus versus small bowel obstruction**: 患者因腸梗阻或腸麻痹入院，並在轉院後出現低血壓和呼吸衰竭。儘管 CT 顯示部分梗阻，但患者仍有排便，且最終未進行手術，因此更傾向於腸麻痹。K56.6 (Paralytic ileus) 是最合適的編碼。
3.  **hypotension and respiratory failure**: 患者因低血壓和呼吸衰竭被轉入 FICU，並最終需要插管。H51.81 (Acute respiratory failure) 和 R09.0 (Hypotension) 是這些症狀的直接編碼。
4.  **refractory ulcerative colitis with a recent hospitalization with bowel perforation requiring abdominal colectomy**: 患者有潰瘍性結腸炎病史，且最近因腸穿孔接受了腹腔結腸切除術。這是一個慢性疾病，因此編碼 ICD-10 慢性潰瘍性結腸炎 K51.90 (Ulcerative colitis, unspecified, without complications)。腸穿孔是過去的事件，但由於是導致腹腔結腸切除術的原因，且目前仍存在結腸切除後的狀態，因此編碼 Z90.4 (Status after abdominal colectomy)。
5.  **CMV colitis**: 患者有巨細胞病毒結腸炎病史，這是一個慢性疾病，因此編碼 B86.1 (Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis)。
6.  **pseudomonas pneumonia**: 患者有假單胞菌肺炎病史，這是一個慢性疾病，因此編碼 J96.1 (Pneumonia due to other specified organisms)。
7.  **HTN**: 患者有高血壓病史，編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
8.  **thymoma s/p robotic assisted L VATS thymectomy w/ LUL wedge resection**: 患者有胸腺瘤病史，且已進行手術切除。這是一個慢性疾病，因此編碼 D13.1 (Benign neoplasm of thymus)。
9.  **multifocal atrial tachycardia**: 患者有心房顫動病史，且正在服用胺碘酮。這是一個慢性疾病，因此編碼 I48.91 (Atrial fibrillation, unspecified)。
10. **Bactrim prophylaxis**: 患者正在服用 Bactrim 作為預防性抗生素，這是一個長期的醫學狀況，因此編碼 Z51.11 (Encounter for prophylactic antibiotic therapy)。
11. **prednisone taper**: 患者正在服用類固醇減量，這是一個長期的醫學狀況，因此編碼 Z51.11 (Encounter for prophylactic antibiotic therapy) 也適用於類固醇減量。
12. **Intubation**: 患者因呼吸衰竭而插管，這是一個急性程序，因此編碼 Z99.82 (Presence of other medical device)。
13. **adverse effect of drugs (Lasix)**: 患者在插管時接受了 40mg 的 IV Lasix，這是一個藥物不良反應，因此編碼 T42.4X5A (Adverse effect of furosemide, initial encounter)。

4.  **History of OSA on CPAP:** 患者有阻塞性睡眠呼吸中止症 (OSA) 並使用 CPAP，應編碼為 G47.33 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric))。
5.  **Chest Tightness, Dyspnea, Cold Room Association, No History of Similar Chest Tightness:** 這些症狀指向急性呼吸系統問題。患者有哮喘病史，且使用了吸入劑，但胸痛是新發的，且胸片顯示肺部萎陷，這更符合急性支氣管炎或肺炎。然而，CTA 未發現肺栓塞，且患者有發燒、白血球升高、尿液檢查陽性，更支持感染性病因。因此，R07.2 (Chest pain) 和 R06.02 (Dyspnea) 可能是症狀編碼。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pressure and atrial fibrillation (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴胸痛和心房顫動，且病史中提到「CABG x3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to distal RCA and OM)」，這表明他有冠狀動脈疾病。因此，冠狀動脈疾病 (I25.10) 和心房顫動 (I48.91) 是主要診斷。
2.  **CABG x3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to distal RCA and OM):** 這表示患者有冠狀動脈搭橋術的病史，且未提及術後併發症。因此，冠狀動脈搭橋術 (Z95.1) 是一個重要的既往手術。
3.  **Atrial fibrillation with RVR (AF with RVR):** 患者入院時有心房顫動伴快速心室反應，這需要控制心率。因此，心房顫動伴快速心室反應 (I48.91) 是一個重要的診斷。
4.  **Single episode of vassal vago-syncope:** 患者有迷走性昏厥的病史，這是一個重要的既往症狀。因此，迷走性昏厥 (R55.81) 是一個重要的既往症狀。
5.  **Poor appetite:** 患者有食慾不振的症狀，這是一個重要的當前症狀。因此，食慾不振 (R63.0) 是一個重要的當前症狀。
6.  **Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) without improvement:** 患者有勞力性呼吸困難，且未見改善，這是一個重要的當前症狀。因此，勞力性呼吸困難 (R06.02) 是一個重要的當前症狀。
7.  **Adverse drug reaction to Lopressor:** 患者在 ED 接受了 Lopressor 5mg IV，這是一個藥物治療。因此，洛沙坦的不良反應 (T42.4X5A) 是一個重要的當前事件。
8.  **Adverse drug reaction to Amiodarone and Pradaxa:** 患者在入院後接受了 Amiodarone 和 Pradaxa 的治療，這兩個藥物都可能引起不良反應。因此，胺碘酮的不良反應 (T46.4X5A) 和達比加群的不良反應 (T43.6X5A) 是重要的當前事件。
9.  **Adverse drug reaction to Aspirin:** 患者有阿司匹林過敏史，這是一個重要的既往過敏史。因此，阿司匹林過敏 (Z91.011) 是一個重要的既往史。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Weakness (Chief Complaint):** 這是主要的主訴，但需要根據病史和檢查結果來判斷其根本原因。病史中提到「recent laminectomy at OSH Thrombectomy」，這表明患者有近期的脊柱手術和血栓切除術，這可能是導致虛弱的原因之一。因此，虛弱本身可能被視為一個症狀，但更應該關注其後面的診斷。
2.  **recent laminectomy at OSH Thrombectomy:** 這是一個重要的診斷，表明患者有脊柱手術史和血栓切除史。這通常與脊髓或神經根壓迫有關，例如脊髓病變或椎間盤突出。因此，應編碼為脊髓病變 (G82.0)。
3.  **PMH significant for chronic anemia, osteoporosis, hypertension, ataxia, and recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls:** 這些是患者的慢性病史，需要編碼：
    *   慢性貧血 (D50.0)

    *   高血壓 (I10)
    *   醉酒 (R27.0)
    *   L5骨折 (S32.5)
4.  **recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls:** 這表明患者有跌倒史，這是一個重要的風險因素，應編碼為跌倒 (Y92.099)。
5.  **Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Penicillins / codeine / Iodinated Contrast- Oral and IV Dye:** 這些是患者的藥物過敏史，應編碼為：
    *   磺胺類藥物過敏 (Z91.011)
    *   青黴素過敏 (Z91.012)
    *   程式碼過敏 (Z91.013)
    *   碘化對比劑過敏 (Z91.014)

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: severe cervical stenosis** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，且病史中明確提到「congenital narrow spinal canal and severe cervical stenosis」，因此應編碼為 M48.06 (Cervical spinal stenosis, congenital, without myelopathy)。
2.  **Spinal cord injury and nerve root avulsion** - 這是患者在車禍中受傷的結果，導致「flail arm on the right」和「hyperreflexia and ___ sign」。這屬於脊髓損傷，應編碼為 S14.009A (Unspecified spinal cord injury, initial encounter)。
3.  **Flail arm on the right** - 這是一個具體的症狀，描述右臂的無力或功能障礙，應編碼為 R27.0 (Paralysis)。
4.  **Hyperreflexia and ___ sign** - 這些是神經系統的症狀，表明存在神經功能異常。由於沒有更具體的診斷，應編碼為 R27.8 (Other specified neurological signs and symptoms)。
5.  **Congenital narrow spinal canal** - 這是一個先天性解剖異常，與嚴重的頸椎狹窄相關，應編碼為 Q76.8 (Other specified congenital malformations of the musculoskeletal system)。
6.  **Car accident** - 這是導致脊髓損傷和神經根撕裂的外部原因，應編碼為 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence of other specified external cause)。
7.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: C-7 posterior laminectomy and instrumented fusion** - 這是一個手術程序，雖然不是診斷，但通常會在病例中提及以支持診斷和治療的背景。在 ICD-10-CM 中，手術本身不編碼為診斷，但可以作為 Z98.89 (Other specified surgical scars) 的補充，表示手術後的狀態。然而，根據 ICD-10-CM 的編碼原則，手術本身不作為診斷編碼，除非是術後併發症或後遺症。因此，Z98.89 可能不是最合適的選擇，除非有明確的術後併發症。在這種情況下，主要診斷是脊髓損傷和頸椎狹窄，因此 Z98.89 可能不是必要的。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Epistaxis (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴為鼻出血，且病歷中明確提到「Patient developed epistaxis ___ around 4 AM」，儘管出血已停止，但這是本次就診的主要原因。因此，應編碼 R04.0 (Epistaxis)。
2.  **End-stage Myelofibrosis (PMH):** 患者有骨髓纖維化的病史，且病歷中多次提及「Myelofibrosis continues to gradually worsen」，這表明這是其主要的慢性疾病。因此，應編碼 D46.0 (Myelofibrosis, chronic, with myeloid metaplasia)。
3.  **Anemia (PMH and HPI):** 患者有慢性貧血病史，且病歷中提到「intermittently requiring transfusion」和「drop in Hgb」，這表明貧血是其持續存在的問題。因此，應編碼 D64.9 (Anemia, unspecified)。
4.  **Thrombocytopenia (PMH and HPI):** 患者有血小板減少症病史，且病歷中提到「intermittently requiring transfusion」和「drop in Plt count」，這表明血小板減少是其持續存在的問題。因此，應編碼 D69.6 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified)。
5.  **Splenomegaly (HPI):** 患者有脾臟腫大的病史，且病歷中提到「increasing splenomegaly」。因此，應編碼 R16.0 (Splenomegaly)。
6.  **Weakness and Fatigue (HPI):** 患者主訴有虛弱和疲勞感，且病歷中提到「feels quite fatigued and weak」和「feeling overall improved since receiving the blood transfusion this morning」。這表明這是其當前的症狀。因此，應編碼 R53.1 (Fatigue) 和 R53.81 (Weakness)。
7.  **Shortness of Breath (HPI):** 患者提到「short of breath during our conversation which according to patient is chronic and at baseline for him」，這表明呼吸急促是其持續存在的症狀。因此，應編碼 R06.02 (Dyspnea)。
8.  **Dark-colored Stool (HPI):** 患者提到「had a bowel movement on arrival to floor which was concerning to him because it was dark in color」，這表明有黑便的症狀。因此，應編碼 R10.1 (Melena)。
9.  **Unsteady on his feet at baseline, using a cane for ambulation (PMH):** 患者有步態不穩的病史，且使用拐杖行走。這表明有步態障礙。因此，應編碼 R26.8 (Other gait disturbance)。
10. **Ruxolitinib Withdrawal Syndrome (HPI):** 患者曾因停用 Ruxolitinib 而出現戒斷症候群，且病歷中提到「Ruxolitinib Withdrawal Syndrome on ___ (now improved with resumption of Ruxolitinib)」。這表明這是其既往的症狀。因此，應編碼 T46.1X5A (Adverse effect of Ruxolitinib)。
11. **Palliative splenic irradiation (PMH):** 患者曾接受脾臟姑息性放射治療，這是一個既往的治療程序。因此，應編碼 Z87.89 (Other specified personal history of other diseases and disorders)。
12. **Environmental factor of injury (Epistaxis):** 患者因鼻出血就醫，這是一個環境因素。因此，應編碼 Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence)。
13. **Reason for encounter (Epistaxis):** 患者因鼻出血就醫，這是一個就診原因。因此，應編碼 Z88.0 (Encounter for epistaxis)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: dizziness** - 患者主訴為眩暈，且病史中描述了急性眩暈的症狀，包括天旋地轉感、失去平衡、頭重感、視力模糊、噁心等。這些症狀符合良性陣發性姿勢性眩暈 (BPPV) 的特徵。因此，R42.10 (Vertigo, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **Right-sided heaviness and numbness** - 患者描述右側身體（臉、手臂、腿）有麻木和沉重感，且這是一種持續性症狀。這提示可能存在神經系統問題，如中風或神經病變。然而，病史中沒有提到急性中風的典型症狀（如偏癱、失語、意識改變），且沒有提到腦部影像學檢查結果。因此，R20.2 (Numbness of unspecified site) 是一個合理的編碼。
3.  **URI symptoms for the last ___ weeks with subjective fevers, holocranial headaches, cough productive of yellow-ish sputum, and nasal congestion** - 患者有上呼吸道感染的症狀，包括發燒、頭痛、咳嗽、黃痰、鼻塞。這提示急性上呼吸道感染。因此，J00 (Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
4.  **HTN (Hypertension)** - 患者有高血壓病史。因此，I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是一個合理的編碼。
5.  **HLD (Hyperlipidemia)** - 患者有高血脂病史。因此，E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
6.  **Fibromyalgia** - 患者有纖維肌痛病史。因此，M79.7 (Fibromyalgia) 是一個合理的編碼。
7.  **GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease)** - 患者有胃食道逆流病史。因此，K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis) 是一個合理的編碼。
8.  **Iron deficiency** - 患者有缺鐵性貧血病史。因此，D50.9 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
9.  **Allergies: aspirin / egg / Oxycodone** - 患者對阿司匹林、雞蛋和氧可酮過敏。因此，Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin), Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances), Z91.019 (Allergy to unspecified drug, medicament and biological substance) 是合理的編碼。
10. **Mild ___ (Cr 1.2, baseline 0.9)** - 患者有輕度腎功能異常，肌酸酐升高。因此，N18.6 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3) 是一個合理的編碼。
11. **Baseline anemia (Hgb ___)** - 患者有貧血。因此，D50.9 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified) 已經涵蓋，但若貧血類型明確，應選擇更特定的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Abdominal Pain, Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea:** 這些是主要的主訴和症狀。由於病史中提到這些症狀是「recurrent」且與「PCKD」相關，最合理的解釋是慢性腎臟病變引起的胃腸道症狀。因此，選擇 K66.0 (Chronic renal failure, unspecified) 來涵蓋這些症狀，因為它通常會伴隨消化系統的併發症。
2.  **ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease):** 這是一個明確的診斷，對應 ICD-10 編碼 N18.6 (End-stage renal disease)。
3.  **PCKD (Polycystic Kidney Disease):** 這是一個明確的慢性疾病，對應 ICD-10 編碼 N25.8 (Other specified cystic kidney diseases)。
4.  **s/p LRRT (Living Related Renal Transplant):** 這表示患者曾接受過活體親屬腎臟移植。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z94.0 (Presence of kidney transplant status)。
5.  **on azathioprine/tacrolimus:** 這些是免疫抑制劑，用於預防器官移植後的排斥反應。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z94.4 (Presence of immunosuppressive therapy)。
6.  **HTN (Hypertension):** 這是一個明確的慢性疾病，對應 ICD-10 編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
7.  **Allergies: Renvela / adhesive / enalapril:** 這些是患者的過敏史。Renvela (一種磷結合劑) 對應 Z88.2 (Allergy to phosphate binder)。Adhesive (膠帶) 對應 Z88.81 (Allergy to adhesive tape)。Enalapril (一種降壓藥) 對應 Z88.0 (Allergy to antihypertensive drug)。

1.  **Right knee pain**: 這是患者就診的主要主訴，但病歷中提到這是「ongoing right knee pain」，並在「History of Present Illness」中進一步描述為「right knee osteoarthritis」。因此，「Right knee pain」是「right knee osteoarthritis」的症狀，而不是獨立的診斷。
2.  **Right knee osteoarthritis**: 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是導致右膝疼痛的根本原因。根據 ICD-10 編碼，膝關節退化性關節炎的編碼是 M17.1 (Osteoarthritis, right knee)。
3.  **Right total knee replacement**: 這是患者接受的治療，而不是診斷。它會對應到一個手術操作碼 (如 0SRJ0ZZ)，但不是 ICD-10 編碼的診斷碼。
4.  **Hx of ongoing right knee pain and right knee osteoarthritis**: 這進一步強化了 M17.1 作為主要診斷的合理性。
5.  **Allergies: Latex / perfume / cefazolin / Dilaudid / lisinopril / shellfish derived**: 這些是患者的過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to latex), Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified substances), Z91.019 (Allergy to unspecified substance)。其中，Latex 是 Z91.011，Perfume 和 Shellfish derived 是 Z91.018，Cefazolin, Dilaudid, Lisinopril 是 Z91.019。
6.  **Hx of ongoing right knee pain and right knee osteoarthritis**: 這表明患者有慢性膝關節退化性關節炎，因此 M17.1 是最合適的診斷碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   M17.1 (Osteoarthritis, right knee)
*   Z91.011 (Allergy to latex)
*   Z91.018 (Allergy to other specified substances)

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Right facial droop** - 這是一個主要症狀，且後續檢查確認為左側面神經麻痺 (Left ___ nerve palsy with left-sided facial droop and forehead spared)。因此，應編碼為 G51.0 (Left facial nerve paralysis)。
2.  **History of Present Illness: Metastatic breast cancer on weekly Taxol and recent diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastasis** - 患者有轉移性乳癌病史，且近期診斷出腦脊膜轉移。這是一個主要的診斷，應編碼為 C50.919 (Malignant neoplasm of unspecified site of breast, secondary)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: Leptomeningeal disease** - 腦脊膜轉移是乳癌的轉移部位，因此 C50.919 已涵蓋此資訊。但 LP 檢查結果顯示腦脊液中高異常細胞，高度懷疑為轉移性癌，這進一步支持 C50.919 的診斷。
4.  **History of Present Illness: New liver metastases** - 腹部 CT 發現新的肝臟轉移，這是一個重要的轉移部位，應編碼為 C22.9 (Malignant neoplasm of liver, unspecified)。
5.  **History of Present Illness: Weekly Taxol** - 患者正在接受化療，這是一個重要的治療資訊，應編碼為 Z51.11 (Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy)。
6.  **History of Present Illness: Numbness to the left lower lip/chin causing drooling and trouble eating (previously had mild right lower lip/chin numbness for the past year)** - 這是一個神經系統症狀，與面神經麻痺相關，因此 G51.0 已涵蓋。
7.  **History of Present Illness: Right ___ and ___ finger numbness, worsening upper back/neck pain** - 這些是神經系統症狀，與腦脊膜轉移相關，因此 G51.0 已涵蓋。
8.  **History of Present Illness: New numbness in her left hand** - 這是一個新的神經系統症狀，與腦脊膜轉移相關，因此 G51.0 已涵蓋。
9.  **History of Present Illness: Double vision when looking to the left** - 這是一個神經系統症狀，與腦脊膜轉移相關，因此 G51.0 已涵蓋。
10. **History of Present Illness: Numbness in several toes bilaterally** - 這是一個神經系統症狀，與腦脊膜轉移相關，因此 G51.0 已涵蓋。
11. **History of Present Illness: Dizziness/vertigo which she described as ""room catching up to head movement"" and vomiting (which she attributed to tramadol)** - 這是一個神經系統症狀，與腦脊膜轉移相關，因此 G51.0 已涵蓋。
12. **History of Present Illness: Aspirin allergy** - 患者有阿司匹林過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin)。
13. **History of Present Illness: Oxycodone allergy** - 患者有氧嗎啡過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.012 (Allergy to other opioid analgesics)。
14. **History of Present Illness: Furosemide allergy** - 患者有呋塞米過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.013 (Allergy to diuretics)。
15. **History of Present Illness: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) allergy** - 患者有磺胺類抗生素過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.014 (Allergy to sulfonamide drugs)。
16. **History of Present Illness: Chocolate flavor allergy** - 患者有巧克力風味過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.019 (Allergy to other specified substances)。
17. **History of Present Illness: WBC 12.6, H/H 9.8/31.9, Plt 257, INR 1.9, Na 138, K 4.5, BUN/Cr ___, ALT 114, AST 118, ALP 282, trop T < 0.01, and lactate 2.0** - 這些是實驗室檢查結果，但未提及具體的診斷或需要單獨編碼的症狀。
18. **History of Present Illness: Head CT was negative** - 這是一個陰性檢查結果，不需編碼。
19. **History of Present Illness: Prior to transfer vitals were 98.4 102 156/91 16 95% RA** - 這些是生命體徵，不需編碼。
20. **History of Present Illness: She requests Tylenol for her back pain** - 這是一個症狀，但未提及具體的診斷或需要單獨編碼的症狀。
21. **History of Present Illness: Denies fevers/chills, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, hematochezia/melena, dysuria, hematuria, and new rashes** - 這些是患者否認的症狀，不需編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Dyspnea, cough (Chief Complaint):** 這些是主要症狀，但病史中提到這些症狀與心力衰竭和肺炎相關，因此會被更特定的診斷碼所涵蓋。
2.  **Congestive heart failure (Past Medical History):** 患者有心力衰竭病史，且最近因心力衰竭惡化入院。這是一個重要的慢性疾病，應編碼 I5020 (Congestive heart failure, unspecified)。
3.  **Coronary artery disease (Past Medical History):** 患者有冠狀動脈疾病病史，且心導管檢查顯示嚴重的多支冠狀動脈疾病，不適合 PCI。這應編碼 I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。
4.  **Hyperlipidemia (Past Medical History):** 患者有高血脂病史，應編碼 E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。
5.  **Hypertension (Past Medical History):** 患者有高血壓病史，應編碼 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
6.  **Recent admission for CHF exacerbation:** 患者因心力衰竭惡化入院，這是一個急性事件，應編碼 R0600 (Dyspnea) 和 R070 (Cough) 作為主要症狀，以及 I5020 (Congestive heart failure, unspecified) 作為基礎疾病。
7.  **Persistent non-productive cough for about a month:** 持續性乾咳，但病史中提到這與心力衰竭和肺炎相關，且已進行了進一步的檢查（如胸部 CT 显示肺結節，PPD 為陰性），因此這可能被視為心力衰竭的症狀之一，或與其他潛在的肺部問題相關。
8.  **Recent pneumonia treated as outpatient:** 患者最近曾因肺炎就診，且心力衰竭惡化被認為是在肺炎的背景下發生的。這應編碼 J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism)。
9.  **Anteroseptal wall motion abnormality consistent on ECHO and catheterization:** 這表明心肌缺血，應編碼 I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。
10. **Severe multivessel coronary artery disease not amenable to PCI:** 這進一步支持了 I2510 的編碼。
11. **Scheduled for CABG:** 這是一個即將進行的程序，不是診斷碼。
12. **Persistent right base opacity without frank pulmonary edema:** 胸部 X 光顯示右下葉陰影，但沒有明顯的肺水腫。這可能與肺炎或肺結節相關，但病史中提到已進行了進一步的檢查（如胸部 CT 显示肺結節，PPD 為陰性），因此這可能被視為肺炎的症狀之一。
13. **Fever at home this AM:** 發燒是肺炎的症狀，應編碼 R509 (Fever, unspecified)。
14. **Outpatient workup for persistent cough, including chest CT in ___ which demonstrated pulmonary nodules:** 肺部結節是發現的異常，應編碼 R918 (Other specified abnormal findings on clinical examination)。
15. **Outpatient PPD has been negative:** 這排除了結核病，因此不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Exertional angina (Chief Complaint):** 這是一個主要症狀，通常與心絞痛相關。由於病史中提到心臟導管檢查顯示嚴重的多支冠狀動脈疾病，且患者有勞力性心絞痛，最合適的編碼是 I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 來表示冠狀動脈疾病，並搭配 R0789 (Angina pectoris, unspecified) 來表示心絞痛症狀。
2.  **Aortic stenosis (History of Present Illness):** 患者有主動脈瓣狹窄病史，且最近的超音波檢查顯示中度主動脈瓣狹窄，並進行了主動脈瓣置換手術。因此，I350 (Aortic valve (steno)sis) 是必要的。
3.  **Diabetes mellitus (History of Present Illness):** 患者有糖尿病史，但病歷中未提及具體類型或併發症。因此，E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 是最合適的。
4.  **Hypertension (History of Present Illness):** 患者有高血壓病史。I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是最合適的。
5.  **Sore throat, post-nasal drip, and cough with scant phlegm (History of Present Illness):** 這些是近期的呼吸道症狀，但患者表示症狀已改善，且未提及診斷。因此，R090 (Other symptoms and signs involving the respiratory system and thorax) 可以涵蓋這些症狀。
6.  **Aortic valve replacement (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個手術，對應於 Z951 (Presence of aortic valve prosthesis)。
7.  **Coronary artery bypass grafting times 4 (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個手術，對應於 Z958 (Presence of other autologous tissue grafts)。
8.  **Severe multivessel coronary artery disease (History of Present Illness):** 這是一個重要的診斷，對應於 I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)。

逐步推理：
1.  **""I just want to go home"" and ""I would like to die, in reality""**: 這些是自殺意念 (Suicidal Ideation) 的明確表達。患者也提到有自殺計畫 (使用槍支)，儘管目前沒有槍支。這符合 ICD-10 編碼 R45.840 (Suicidal ideation)。
2.  **""extremely down and sad; waking up each morning thinking to herself 'god, not another.' She reports feeling very upset and let down that ___ is not as she imagined it would be, that ___ is the 'end of the world' and that now her dream is dead, that she would 'like to die, in reality,' noting she can't enjoy life anymore.""**: 這些描述強烈指向重度抑鬱症 (Major Depressive Disorder)。患者有持續的悲傷、失去興趣、自殺意念，且這些症狀嚴重影響其生活。這符合 ICD-10 編碼 F33.1 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features)。雖然患者否認幻覺，但「自殺意念」和「自責」等症狀可能被視為精神病性特徵。
3.  **""feeling anxious and scared at times, and experiencing intense moments of self-hate""**: 這些是焦慮症狀，但由於主要診斷是重度抑鬱症，且焦慮症狀是其一部分，因此不需要單獨編碼。
4.  **""fear of someone breaking through her window and trying to attack her, and not liking people looking at her on the street because she is worried they are going to attack her""**: 這些是偏執性焦慮，屬於焦慮症狀的一部分，不需單獨編碼。
5.  **""Buddhist and often believes that there are messages for her on the TV, or from the trees, birds, everywhere. Reports that those messages never tell her to harm herself or others. The negative thoughts come from inside her head.""**: 這些是宗教性或文化性的信念，不構成幻覺或妄想，因此不需編碼。
6.  **""nightmares, that include having her throat slit by zombies, or being chased or killed by wolves or dogs""**: 這些是夢魘，屬於焦慮症狀的一部分，不需單獨編碼。
7.  **""denies auditory or visual hallucinations""**: 患者否認聽覺或視覺幻覺，因此不編碼妄想或幻覺。
8.  **""does not like being on the bus or the train, or in crowded spaces or going through tunnels""**: 這些是特定的焦慮情境，屬於焦慮症狀的一部分，不需單獨編碼。
9.  **""past psychiatric history of PTSD""**: 患者有創傷後壓力症候群的病史，但目前的症狀和主訴主要指向重度抑鬱症，且未提及 PTSD 的當前症狀。因此，除非有明確的 PTSD 當前症狀描述，否則不編碼 F43.10 (Post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified)。
10. **""possible psychosis""**: 患者有自殺意念和自責，但否認幻覺。這可能被視為重度抑鬱症的「精神病性特徵」，因此 F33.1 已涵蓋。
11. **""possible cognitive impairment""**: 患者有「intersexual (hermaphrodite)」和「refugee」背景，但病歷中未提及明確的認知功能障礙症狀。因此，不編碼 R41.81 (Cognitive disorder, unspecified)。
12. **""intersexual (hermaphrodite)""**: 這是一個性別/性別認同的描述，不構成疾病，因此不編碼。
13. **""refugee""**: 這是一個社會背景描述，不構成疾病，因此不編碼。
14. **""does not like the interpreter and demonstrated good ability to understand and communicate in ___""**: 這是一個語言溝通的細節，不構成疾病，因此不編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   **F33.1 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features)**: 重度抑鬱症，伴有自殺意念和自責，符合「精神病性特徵」。

逐步推理：
1.  **fevers (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴發燒，且病史中提到「fever of 102.9°F」和「febrile at ___ to 100.6F up to ___」，這表明發燒是主要的症狀。因此，R50.9 (Fever, unspecified) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **UTI (Urgent Care Diagnosis):** 患者在急診室被診斷為泌尿道感染，且病史中提到「Found to have a UTI at urgent care」。這是一個明確的診斷，因此 N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified) 是一個必要的編碼。
3.  **HTN (Hypertension):** 患者有高血壓病史，這是一個慢性疾病。因此，I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是一個合理的編碼。
4.  **Neuropathy:** 患者有神經病變病史，這是一個慢性疾病。因此，G63.9 (Unspecified peripheral neuropathy) 是一個合理的編碼。
5.  **s/p CVA with resultant hemiplegia and pseudobulbar and bulbar findings:** 患者有中風後遺症，導致偏癱、假性球部和球部症狀。這是一個慢性後遺症，因此 I69.351 (Hemiplegia following cerebral infarction) 是一個合理的編碼。
6.  **dysarthria and dysphagia:** 患者有失語和吞嚥困難，這是由中風引起的後遺症。因此，R47.0 (Dysarthria) 和 R13.10 (Dysphagia, unspecified) 是合理的編碼。
7.  **bilateral vocal fold atrophy:** 患者有雙側聲帶萎縮，這是一個慢性疾病。因此，J38.5 (Vocal cord atrophy) 是一個合理的編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **FAP (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis):** 這是一個遺傳性結直腸癌的高風險疾病，對應 ICD-10 編碼 D12.81 (Other specified benign neoplasm of large intestine)。雖然 FAP 本身是良性，但其高風險性通常會被編碼。
2.  **Biopsy-proven periampullary adenoma with high grade dysplasia:** 這是一個良性腫瘤，但具有高度異型性，可能發展成惡性。對應 ICD-10 編碼 D13.5 (Benign neoplasm of ampulla of Vater)。
3.  **Ex lap, pancreas sparing duodenectomy, distal gastrectomy, and cholecystectomy:** 這些是手術史，通常不編碼為當前診斷，除非有併發症或後遺症。
4.  **Abdominal pain, low grade temperatures (Tmax 100.0 at home), increased output from the medial drain site, night sweats:** 這些是當前的症狀和體徵，提示感染或炎症。由於患者有引流管，且有腹痛、發熱、引流液增加，最合理的診斷是引流管相關的感染。
5.  **CT-guided drainage of peripancreatic abscess:** 這是一個手術程序，用於治療胰周膿腫。這表明存在胰周膿腫，對應 ICD-10 編碼 K86.1 (Pancreatic abscess)。
6.  **Loose stools at baseline as he is s/p colectomy:** 這表明患者有慢性排便習慣改變，對應 ICD-10 編碼 R19.7 (Other specified symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen)。
7.  **Allergies: codeine / hydrocodone / oxycodone:** 這些是藥物過敏史，對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z91.011 (Allergy to codeine), Z91.012 (Allergy to hydrocodone), Z91.013 (Allergy to oxycodone)。
8.  **s/p colectomy:** 這是一個手術史，對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z90.4 (Personal history of colostomy)。

最合理的編碼集合：
*   **K86.1 (Pancreatic abscess):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，由腹痛、發熱、引流液增加和夜間盜汗等症狀支持。
*   **D12.81 (Other specified benign neoplasm of large intestine):** 這是患者的基礎疾病，FAP。
*   **D13.5 (Benign neoplasm of ampulla of Vater):** 這是導致手術的良性腫瘤。
*   **R19.7 (Other specified symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen):** 這是患者基線的排便習慣改變。
*   **Z91.011 (Allergy to codeine), Z91.012 (Allergy to hydrocodone), Z91.013 (Allergy to oxycodone):** 這些是患者的藥物過敏史。
*   **Z90.4 (Personal history of colostomy):** 這是患者的外科手術史。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Fatigue and feeling ""not herself"" since starting flecainide:** 這是一個主要的主訴，且與藥物使用相關。由於患者在服用 flecainide 後出現，且描述為 ""incredibly fatigued"" 和 ""not left the house over the past week""，這強烈指向藥物不良反應。因此，R53.83 (Other fatigue) 是一個合理的編碼。
2.  **Orthostatic hypotension:** 患者報告在過去幾天有直立性低血壓，且丈夫測量時血壓從坐姿 112->80。ED 的生命體徵也顯示出直立性低血壓的跡象 (laying 135/71, sitting 135/71, standing 135/71)。這是一個重要的症狀，應編碼為 R55.2 (Orthostatic hypotension)。
3.  **Dizziness and feeling lightheaded:** 這些是患者在 ED 的主訴，且與低血壓和疲勞相關。R42.1 (Dizziness and giddiness) 是一個合理的編碼。
4.  **Headache:** 患者在 ED 報告有頭痛，這是一個症狀，應編碼為 R51.0 (Headache)。
5.  **Atrial fibrillation s/p Watchman:** 患者有心房顫動病史，且已進行 Watchman 手術。I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation) 是一個合理的編碼。
6.  **Watchman procedure:** 這是一個手術，但患者目前沒有相關的急性併發症或後遺症，因此不需要編碼。
7.  **Flecainide use:** 患者正在服用 flecainide，且其不良反應是本次就診的主要原因。Z79.01 (Long-term (current) use of cardiac and vasodilator drugs) 是一個合理的編碼，表示長期使用心血管藥物。
8.  **Adverse effect of flecainide:** 患者因服用 flecainide 出現疲勞、直立性低血壓、頭暈和頭痛。T45.2X5A (Adverse effect of flecainide, initial encounter) 是一個合理的編碼，表示藥物不良反應的首次就診。
9.  **Hypotension:** 患者有低血壓症狀，且直立性低血壓是其表現之一。R05.0 (Hypotension) 是一個合理的編碼。
10. **Allergies:** 患者有多種過敏史，包括 NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug)。Z91.011 (Allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) 是一個合理的編碼。
11. **Other medications:** 患者正在服用 apixaban (抗凝血劑)、metoprolol (β受體阻滯劑)、nadolol (β受體阻滯劑)。這些是長期用藥，應編碼為 Z79.01 (Long-term (current) use of cardiac and vasodilator drugs)。
12. **History of hypertension:** 患者有高血壓病史，且正在服用 β受體阻滯劑。I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是一個合理的編碼。
13. **History of osteoporosis:** 患者有骨質疏鬆病史。M81.0 (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture) 是一個合理的編碼。
14. **History of falls:** 患者有跌倒病史。Z87.891 (Personal history of fall) 是一個合理的編碼。
15. **History of fracture:** 患者有骨折病史。Z87.892 (Personal history of fracture) 是一個合理的編碼。
16. **History of chronic anemia:** 患者有慢性貧血病史。D50.0 (Chronic iron deficiency anemia) 是一個合理的編碼。
17. **History of ataxia:** 患者有共濟失調病史。R27.0 (Ataxia) 是一個合理的編碼。
18. **History of recent L5 fracture:** 患者有近期 L5 骨折病史。M81.0 (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture) 已涵蓋骨質疏鬆，而骨折本身是過去事件，因此不需要編碼。
19. **History of recent fall:** 患者有近期跌倒病史。Z87.891 (Personal history of fall) 已涵蓋。

逐步推理：
1.  **Bleeding from colostomy site (主訴):** 這是患者就診的主要原因。由於是從造口部位出血，且病史中提到是結腸癌術後，最合理的編碼是 K66.6 (Other specified diseases of the colon) 來表示造口部位的出血。此外，K66.6 也涵蓋了造口相關的其他問題。
2.  **Colon cancer (pT3N0; s/p resection):** 患者有結腸癌病史，且已進行手術切除。K50.00 (Colon cancer without metastasis) 用於表示原發性結腸癌，未轉移。
3.  **ETOH cirr (c/b EVs):** 患者有酒精性肝硬化，伴有食道靜脈曲張。K70.30 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver without esophageal varices) 用於酒精性肝硬化，但患者有食道靜脈曲張，因此需要 K70.31 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver with esophageal varices)。
4.  **Liver resection (s/p RFA, TACE):** 患者有肝臟切除病史，且曾進行射頻消融和經動脈化學栓塞治療。Z85.01 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of liver) 用於表示肝臟惡性腫瘤的個人病史。
5.  **CKD:** 患者有慢性腎臟病。N18.6 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5) 用於表示慢性腎臟病第5期。
6.  **CHB (PPM):** 患者有慢性乙型肝炎，且是潛伏性乙肝。B18.1 (Chronic viral hepatitis B, not elsewhere classified) 用於慢性乙型肝炎，B19.2 (Chronic HBV carrier status) 用於潛伏性乙肝攜帶者狀態。
7.  **Weakness:** 患者有虛弱症狀。R53.1 (Weakness) 用於表示虛弱。
8.  **Clonidine allergy:** 患者對可樂定過敏。Z91.013 (Allergy to other antihypertensive drugs) 用於表示對其他降壓藥物的過敏。
9.  **Stopped taking baby aspirin:** 患者最近停止服用小劑量阿司匹林。Z91.011 (Patient's refusal of drug therapy) 用於表示患者拒絕藥物治療。
10. **Adverse effect of drugs (laxatives/opioids):** 患者因使用瀉藥和止痛藥導致腹瀉和虛弱。T47.4X5A (Adverse effect of other laxatives, initial encounter) 用於表示其他瀉藥的不良反應，初始就診。
11. **Environmental factor of injury (unspecified place of occurrence):** 患者有跌倒史，Y92.099 (Unspecified place of occurrence) 用於表示未指定發生地點的環境因素。
12. **Aspirin allergy:** 患者有阿司匹林過敏。Z91.011 (Patient's refusal of drug therapy) 也涵蓋了對藥物的過敏。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: altered mental status** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，且病歷中描述為「nodding off」、「only alert to some verbal, but mainly painful stimulus」、「somnolent」、「unable to provide any collateral information」，這些都指向意識狀態改變。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 R40.20 (Altered mental status, unspecified)。
2.  **PMH substance abuse** - 患者有物質濫用的病史，且在 EMS 報告中提到「may have told EMS that he took narcotics」，這表明物質濫用是導致當前症狀的原因。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 F19.20 (Other drug use, uncomplicated)。
3.  **Pinpoint pupils** - 這是嗎啡等阿片類藥物中毒的典型體徵。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 R08.2 (Pinpoint pupils)。
4.  **BGL was 74** - 血糖值 74 屬於低血糖。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 R73.03 (Hypoglycemia)。
5.  **Unable to evaluate ROS** - 患者因意識狀態改變無法提供病史，這是一個重要的臨床資訊，表示患者無法配合進一步的病史回溯。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z88.0 (Patient unable to give medical history)。
6.  **Patient left AMA** - 患者自行離開就醫，這是一個重要的就診結果。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 Z91.13 (Patient left against medical advice)。

1.  **right patella non ___**: 這表示右膝蓋骨的非移位性骨折。在 ICD-10 中，非移位性骨折的代碼是 S82.0。由於是右側，因此使用 S82.01 (Right patella, non-displaced fracture)。
2.  **s/p ORIF right patella fx x2**: 這表示患者曾接受過右膝蓋骨骨折的開放性復位內固定術 (ORIF)。這是一個既往的手術史，應使用 Z90.811 (Presence of other internal orthopedic implant, device, or graft) 來表示。
3.  **hx of patella non ___**: 這表示患者有膝蓋骨非移位性骨折的病史。這是一個慢性或既往的診斷，應使用 Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) 來表示。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pain (left-sided, with exertion, occasionally at rest, nonradiating, not pleuritic):**  This is a significant symptom. Given the patient's history of CAD, s/p CABG and PCI, and the description of the pain, it is most consistent with angina pectoris. Since it occurs with exertion and occasionally at rest, it is classified as unstable angina. The ICD-10 code for unstable angina pectoris is I20.0.
2.  **Cough, dyspnea, and low extremity edema:**  These are symptoms of heart failure. The presence of bilateral lower extremity swelling and dyspnea on exertion and when lying flat strongly suggests congestive heart failure. The ICD-10 code for congestive heart failure is I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified).
3.  **History of CAD s/p CABG and PCI:**  This is a chronic condition. The ICD-10 code for old myocardial infarction is I25.2. The ICD-10 code for atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery is I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris). The ICD-10 code for status post coronary artery bypass graft is Z95.1. The ICD-10 code for status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is Z95.5.
4.  **CKD stage 2:**  This is a chronic condition. The ICD-10 code for chronic kidney disease, stage 2 is N18.3.
5.  **CVA:**  This is a chronic condition. The ICD-10 code for cerebral infarction, unspecified, is I69.39 (Late effect of cerebral infarction, other).
6.  **HTN:**  This is a chronic condition. The ICD-10 code for essential (primary) hypertension is I10.
7.  **DM:**  This is a chronic condition. The ICD-10 code for type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications is E11.9.
8.  **PE:**  This is a chronic condition. The ICD-10 code for pulmonary embolism, unspecified, is I26.9.
9.  **Increased urinary frequency and right-sided flank pain consistent with prior urinary tract infection and history of kidney stones:**  These symptoms suggest a urinary tract infection. The ICD-10 code for unspecified bacterial cystitis is N39.0. The ICD-10 code for kidney stones is N20.0 (Calculus of kidney).
10. **Bacterial conjunctivitis (treated with antibiotic ointment):**  This is an acute condition. The ICD-10 code for bacterial conjunctivitis is H10.013 (Bacterial conjunctivitis, right eye).
11. **Allergies:**  The patient has multiple drug allergies. The ICD-10 code for allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics is Z88.0. The ICD-10 code for allergy to doxycycline is Z88.2. The ICD-10 code for allergy to erythromycin base is Z88.3. The ICD-10 code for allergy to clindamycin is Z88.4. The ICD-10 code for allergy to azithromycin is Z88.5.

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Scleroderma associated with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension on continuous IV epoprostenol:** 這是一個複合診斷，包含兩個主要疾病。 scleroderma (系統性硬化症) 是一個慢性自身免疫性疾病，對應 ICD-10 編碼 M34.1 (Systemic scleroderma)。 由於其與肺動脈高壓 (PAH) 有關，PAH 是 scleroderma 的一個重要併發症，因此需要單獨編碼。肺動脈高壓的 ICD-10 編碼是 I27.2 (Pulmonary hypertension, unspecified)。此外，患者正在使用 IV epoprostenol 來治療 PAH，這是一個重要的治療資訊，應編碼為 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of antihypertensive drugs)。
2.  **Progressive myalgias, fatigue, malaise, and headache for a month:** 這些是主要的主訴和症狀。全身性肌肉疼痛 (myalgias) 對應 R53.1 (Myalgia)。疲勞 (fatigue) 對應 R53.81 (Fatigue)。全身不適 (malaise) 對應 R53.82 (Malaise)。頭痛 (headache) 對應 R51.9 (Headache, unspecified)。
3.  **Head CT showed known left parietal meningioma, with slight increase in surrounding edema:** 這是一個已知的良性腫瘤，且有輕微的周圍水腫。腦膜瘤的 ICD-10 編碼是 D32.1 (Benign neoplasm of meninges)。周圍水腫是腫瘤的併發症，對應 G93.9 (Unspecified cerebral edema)。
4.  **Labs showed CRP 48, ESR 62, mild pancytopenia (low platelets expected with epo but otherwise unclear etiology), elevated alk phos/GGT, low free T4 with normal TSH, blood culture negative x1:** 這些是實驗室檢查結果，提示存在炎症或感染。C-反應蛋白 (CRP) 和紅細胞沉降率 (ESR) 升高是炎症的指標，對應 R79.0 (Elevated C-reactive protein) 和 R79.8 (Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate)。輕度全血細胞減少 (pancytopenia) 對應 D61.81 (Other specified anemias)。血小板減少 (low platelets) 是 Epoprostenol 的已知副作用，因此不單獨編碼。鹼性磷酸酶 (alk phos) 和 GGT 升高是肝功能異常的指標，對應 R94.1 (Abnormal liver function tests)。低游離 T4 (low free T4) 伴正常 TSH 指示亞臨床甲狀腺功能減退，對應 E03.9 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified)。
5.  **Over the weekend, she also developed what she and husband describe as hallucinations. She states that when she dozes off she sees flashes of light and also insects on the floor; when she wakes up she sometimes does not know where she is and is confused. Per notes she has auditory hallucinations as well. Husband still feels that she is not entirely back to her baseline.** 這些是精神症狀，包括視覺幻覺、聽覺幻覺、定向力障礙和意識混亂。視覺幻覺對應 R29.1 (Visual hallucinations)。聽覺幻覺對應 R29.2 (Auditory hallucinations)。定向力障礙對應 R41.82 (Disorientation)。意識混亂對應 R41.81 (Confusion)。
6.  **Review of systems is otherwise notable for decreased appetite and 7 lb weight loss over past week, 40 lb weight loss over past year.** 食欲減退 (decreased appetite) 對應 R63.0 (Anorexia)。體重減輕 (weight loss) 對應 R63.4 (Weight loss)。
7.  **Infectious review of systems only notable for nasal congestion and sore throat x 3 days.** 鼻塞 (nasal congestion) 對應 J00 (Common cold without bronchitis)。喉嚨痛 (sore throat) 通常包含在 J00 中，因此不單獨編碼。
8.  **Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions** 沒有過敏史，因此不編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Fever and hypotension (Chief Complaint):** 這些是主要的症狀，但需要找出其後的診斷原因。
2.  **Past history of follicular lymphoma with multiple treatment attempts with several different agents most recently on Zydelig:** 這表明患者有非霍奇金淋巴瘤 (NHL) 的病史，且目前正在接受治療。因此，應編碼為 C82.10 (Follicular lymphoma, unspecified site)。
3.  **Recently discharged after a short stay for fever:** 這表明患者曾因發燒入院，且目前的發燒可能是同一個問題的延續。
4.  **Blood cultures were negative, chest XR, and CT torso unremarkable for source of infection. She received one dose of vancomycin and cefepime which were stopped given low suspicion for infection:** 這表明在之前的入院中，感染源未明確，且未發現明確的感染源。
5.  **Patient remained afebrile while in the hospital and was discharged on ___:** 患者在之前的入院中退燒並出院。
6.  **On her way home, she felt unwell. She got home and went to bed, and immediately felt nauseous and vomited once. She checked her temperature and she had a fever to 104. She took Tylenol every 4 hours with little improvement in her fever down to 102-102 overnight. In the morning, she called her primary oncologist who asked her to come to the clinic.** 這描述了當前發燒和惡心的症狀，以及就醫的過程。
7.  **In the clinic, the patient was afebrile. She was found to be hypotensive to 88/39 and HR 95. Labs showed WBC 5.0, Bands 6, Na 129, and Cr 1.2. CXR showed new faint RUL infiltrate. UA was bland. She received 1L of NS and was started on cefepime and vancomycin for coverage of HCAP.** 這些是就診時的檢查結果和初步處理。WBC 5.0 和 Bands 6 指示輕度白血球增多和未成熟細胞增多，提示感染。CXR 的 RUL 激發性浸潤是肺部感染的證據。Hypotension (88/39) 和 Na 129 (低鈉血症) 是體液丟失或感染的體徵。Cr 1.2 (輕度腎功能不全) 可能是低血壓或脫水的結果。因此，這些檢查結果支持感染性休克的診斷。
8.  **Denies any sick contacts, recent travel, or hotel stays. She reports hiking in ___ this past weekend. Denies any noticeable tick bites. She has one cat, but denies any scratches or bites.** 這些是排除其他感染源的資訊。

逐步推理：
1.  **Abdominal pain (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，但通常不作為主要診斷編碼，除非沒有更明確的診斷。在這種情況下，有更明確的診斷（急性闌尾炎），因此 R109 (Abdominal pain, unspecified) 可能作為附加症狀。
2.  **IVF last week:** 這是一個重要的病史，表明患者最近進行了體外受精。這與急性闌尾炎的發生可能有相關性，因此 Z310 (Encounter for artificial insemination) 是一個重要的附加診斷。
3.  **Uterine fibroids s/p removal ___ years ago:** 這是一個既往病史，表明患者有子宮肌瘤病史，但已切除。這是一個重要的慢性病史，因此 D259 (Benign neoplasm of uterus, unspecified) 是一個重要的附加診斷。
4.  **Acute appendicitis (MRI characterization):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是最嚴重的診斷。因此，K3590 (Acute appendicitis without perforation or abscess) 是主要診斷。
5.  **RLQ fluid collection (U/S finding):** 這是急性闌尾炎的影像學表現，通常包含在 K3590 中，因此不需要單獨編碼。
6.  **11mm fluid filled appendix (MRI finding):** 這也是急性闌尾炎的影像學表現，通常包含在 K3590 中，因此不需要單獨編碼。
7.  **Diagnostic laparoscopy (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這是一個手術程序，通常不編碼為診斷，而是作為手術記錄的一部分。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   K3590 (Acute appendicitis without perforation or abscess) - 主要診斷，最嚴重的急性問題。
*   D259 (Benign neoplasm of uterus, unspecified) - 重要的既往病史。
*   Z310 (Encounter for artificial insemination) - 重要的近期病史，可能與急性闌尾炎的發生相關。

逐步推理：
1.  **R worsening right eye vision**: 這是主要的主訴，且病史中提到右眼視力惡化，並有視網膜動脈栓塞的發現。這應編碼為視力障礙，最合適的是 H54.8 (Other visual impairment)。
2.  **R central retinal vein occlusion (R branch retinal artery cholesterol embolus)**: 這是導致視力惡化的根本原因。視網膜動脈栓塞屬於視網膜動脈阻塞，編碼為 H34.81 (Retinal artery occlusion, unspecified eye)。由於是右眼，應使用 H34.811 (Retinal artery occlusion, right eye)。
3.  **Baseline vision in R eye ___ plaques**: 這表明右眼有視網膜病變，最常見的是視網膜動脈栓塞後的病變，因此 H34.811 已涵蓋。
4.  **Hypertension**: 這是患者的慢性病史，編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
5.  **TIA in ___ associated with dysarthria and left leg weakness**: 這是一個既往的中風事件，應編碼為 Z86.73 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack)。
6.  **L proximal ICA ___ stenosis on CTA**: 這是導致TIA的潛在原因，應編碼為 I65.20 (Unspecified carotid artery stenosis)。
7.  **Plavix 75 mg and Atorvastatin 40 mg**: 這些是用於預防進一步中風的藥物，屬於長期用藥，應編碼為 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants) 和 Z79.59 (Long term (current) use of other drugs)。
8.  **Aspirin allergy**: 這是患者的過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin)。
9.  **Celebrex / Travatan allergy**: 這是患者的過敏史，應編碼為 Z91.019 (Allergy to other specified drugs, medicaments and biological substances)。
10. **R pupil reaction to consensual response only**: 這是一個體格檢查發現，表明右眼瞳孔對光反應異常，應編碼為 H53.81 (Abnormal pupillary reaction)。
11. **Diminished ___ in the R eye**: 這是一個體格檢查發現，表明右眼視力減退，應編碼為 H54.8 (Other visual impairment)。

1.  **Chief Complaint: cough** - 患者主訴是咳嗽，這是一個症狀，應編碼為 R05。
2.  **History of Present Illness: cough and shortness of breath from ___ to ___ where he was found to have an elevated BNP and symptoms were attributed to volume overload. He was dialyzed and discharged home. When he got home he felt worse with continued cough which is non-productive and worse with lying down. He also developed shakiness after he had dialysis which has continued. He notes shortness of breath when laying flat.** - 患者有呼吸困難、咳嗽、躺下時症狀加劇、以及躺下時呼吸困難，這些都是呼吸系統症狀。由於患者有慢性腎臟病史，且有體積超負荷的病史，這些症狀可能與心臟功能不全相關。因此，R05 (Cough) 和 R06.02 (Dyspnea) 是合理的症狀編碼。
3.  **History of Present Illness: elevated BNP** - BNP升高是心臟功能不全的指標，應編碼為 I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: regional wall motion abnormality, moderately decreased LV systolic function, as well as trace bilateral effusions versus edema.** - 這些是心臟超音波檢查結果，進一步支持心臟功能不全的診斷。I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified) 仍然適用。
5.  **History of Present Illness: EKG showed SR QTc 504, e/o LVH with lateral T-wave inversions/strain pattern and diffuse ST depressions.** - 心電圖顯示左心室肥大 (LVH) 和心肌缺血的跡象。應編碼為 I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 和 I25.2 (Other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease)。
6.  **History of Present Illness: Blood cultures were drawn. CXR showed hazy left lung opacity and pulmonary edema. Cardiology was consulted and recommended TTE. ___ was consulted who recommended admission and treatment for CAP.** - 胸部X光顯示左肺模糊陰影和肺水腫，且患者被診斷為社區獲得性肺炎 (CAP)。應編碼為 J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism)。
7.  **History of Present Illness: patient has recurrent wet cough and one episode of nausea vomiting.** - 患者有反覆的濕性咳嗽和一次嘔吐，這可以歸類為呼吸系統症狀。R05 (Cough) 已經涵蓋咳嗽，而 R11.10 (Nausea) 可以編碼嘔吐。

逐步推理：
1.  **Cough, Congestion, Productive Cough, Runny Nose, Sore Throat, Subjective Fevers:** 這些症狀集合指向急性上呼吸道感染。最常見的編碼是 J00 (Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified)。雖然有提到咳痰，但沒有明確的肺炎證據，且胸部X光顯示的是肺不張而非肺炎，因此 J00 是最合適的選擇。
2.  **Bibasilar Atelectasis:** 胸部X光顯示雙側基底肺不張，這是一個明確的診斷。編碼為 J98.11 (Atelectasis, unspecified, bilateral)。
3.  **T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus):** 這是患者的慢性病史。編碼為 E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。
4.  **HTN (Hypertension):** 這是患者的慢性病史。編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
5.  **UTI in ___ with Ecoli R to cipro, Bactrim, and ampicillin:** 患者有泌尿道感染的病史，且目前尿液檢查顯示中度白血球，這表明可能存在活動性泌尿道感染。編碼為 N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified)。
6.  **R>L 2+ pitting lower extremity edema:** 患者有雙下肢水腫，且有高血壓和糖尿病史，這可能與慢性腎臟病變或心臟疾病相關。由於沒有明確的腎臟或心臟診斷，最合理的編碼是 R60.0 (Edema)。
7.  **Scattered wheezes throughout bilateral lung fields:** 肺部聽診有散在哮鳴音，這可能與支氣管炎或哮喘相關。由於沒有明確的哮喘診斷，且患者沒有慢性呼吸系統疾病史，最合理的編碼是 R05.9 (Unspecified wheezing)。
8.  **Lactate 3.9 to 3.3:** 乳酸輕微升高，這可能與脫水或感染相關。由於沒有明確的乳酸酸中毒診斷，且患者沒有其他嚴重的代謝異常，這通常不編碼為主要診斷，除非有進一步的臨床證據。
9.  **WBC 10.2:** 白血球輕微升高，這可能與感染相關。由於沒有明確的白血球增多症診斷，這通常不編碼為主要診斷，除非有進一步的臨床證據。
10. **K 4.0 on re-check:** 電解質檢查顯示血鉀 4.0，這在正常範圍內，因此不需要編碼。
11. **Patient requested a commode and walker and wants to go home when possible:** 這表明患者有活動能力受限，但沒有明確的診斷。這通常不編碼為主要診斷，除非有進一步的臨床證據。
12. **Pain in her right ankle where she has had ""laser"" procedures:** 這表明患者有右腳踝疼痛，但沒有明確的診斷。這通常不編碼為主要診斷，除非有進一步的臨床證據。
13. **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 患者沒有已知的過敏史，因此不需要編碼。

</think>

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: shortness of breath** - 這是主要症狀，但需要根據病史和診斷來編碼。
2.  **PMHx of diastolic heart failure** - 這是主要的診斷。由於患者有「worsening breathing for several days」、「wheezing without any improvement from the inhaler」、「+Orthopnea. +PND.」等症狀，且「dyspnea is exertional」，這些都指向心力衰竭的惡化。因此，I5024 (Congestive heart failure, diastolic) 是最合適的編碼。
3.  **T2DM on insulin** - 這是慢性病史。I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 並非糖尿病的編碼。應使用 E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 來表示2型糖尿病，並使用 Z795 (Long-term (current) use of insulin) 來表示胰島素的長期使用。
4.  **CKD** - 慢性腎臟病。N185 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5) 通常表示末期腎臟病，但病歷中未明確說明 CKD 的階段。若無階段資訊，N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified) 是更安全的選擇。
5.  **Hypertension** - 高血壓。I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是基本高血壓的編碼。
6.  **Allergies: hydrocodone-acetaminophen** - 藥物過敏。Z91011 (Allergy to analgesic) 是對止痛藥的過敏。
7.  **No URI symptoms. Some chills last night. No fevers. No N/V/D.** - 這些是症狀，但沒有明確的診斷。由於患者有「worsening breathing for several days」、「wheezing without any improvement from the inhaler」，且「dyspnea is exertional」，這些都指向心力衰竭的惡化，而不是呼吸道感染。因此，R060 (Dyspnea) 可以作為症狀編碼。
8.  **Initial VS were 99.0 84 174/70 24 94% RA.** - 這些是生命體徵，通常不直接編碼，除非有異常值需要特別關注。174/70 的收縮壓和舒張壓在正常範圍內，24 的呼吸速率和94%的血氧飽和度也沒有異常。因此，這些生命體徵本身不需要編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   I5024 (Congestive heart failure, diastolic) - 主要診斷，心力衰竭惡化。
*   E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) - 2型糖尿病。
*   Z795 (Long-term (current) use of insulin) - 胰島素長期使用。
*   N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified) - 慢性腎臟病。
*   I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) - 基本高血壓。
*   R060 (Dyspnea) - 呼吸困難症狀。
*   Z91011 (Allergy to analgesic) - 止痛藥過敏。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Left femoral neck fracture (ORIF with DHS + derotational screw):** 這是病人的主要診斷，也是導致就醫和手術的原因。根據 ICD-10 編碼，股骨頸骨折的代碼是 S72.0。由於是進行了內固定術 (ORIF)，需要添加一個表示骨折狀態的附加碼，即 S72.011A (Unspecified femoral neck fracture, initial encounter for open fracture type I or II)。這表示股骨頸骨折，初次就診，開放性骨折 I 或 II 型。雖然病歷中未明確說明是開放性骨折，但由於進行了 ORIF，通常會假設為開放性骨折。
2.  **PMH significant for chronic anemia:** 慢性貧血是病人的既往病史，應編碼為 D50.0 (Iron deficiency anemia)。
3.  **PMH significant for osteoporosis:** 骨質疏鬆症是病人的既往病史，應編碼為 M81.0 (Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture)。
4.  **PMH significant for hypertension:** 高血壓是病人的既往病史，應編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
5.  **PMH significant for ataxia:** 醉酒步態是病人的既往病史，應編碼為 R27.0 (Ataxia)。
6.  **PMH significant for recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls:** 這是一個重要的既往病史，表明患者有跌倒史和骨質疏鬆性骨折的風險。應編碼為 Z87.891 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) 來表示個人病史，以及 Z87.898 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions) 來表示個人病史的其他指定疾病和狀況。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: skin redness** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，但需要進一步了解其背後的診斷。在病史中，患者提到「Drainage from site since ___」和「Red. Been on Keflex since ___ without improvement.」，這表明紅腫是導尿管部位感染的症狀。
2.  **PMH: Afib (Atrial Fibrillation)** - 這是患者的慢性病史，對應 ICD-10 編碼 I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)。
3.  **PMH: HFrEF (Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction)** - 這是患者的慢性病史，對應 ICD-10 編碼 I50.22 (Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF))。
4.  **PMH: BPH with suprapubic drain in place** - 這是患者的慢性病史，對應 ICD-10 編碼 N40.1 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia) 和 Z99.89 (Other specified long-term (current) drug therapy)。Z99.89 用於表示長期使用導尿管。
5.  **Suprapubic tube exchange** - 這是本次就診的治療程序，對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z46.81 (Encounter for other specified surgical aftercare)。
6.  **Drainage from site since ___** - 這是導尿管部位感染的症狀，對應 ICD-10 編碼 N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified)。
7.  **Red. Been on Keflex since ___ without improvement.** - 這進一步支持導尿管部位感染的診斷，並表明抗生素治療無效，這通常會導致感染的編碼。
8.  **Denies abd pain, n/v/f/c.** - 這些是患者否認的症狀，不需要編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: cholestasis** - 這是患者就診的主要原因，且後續檢查（ERCP）也證實了膽道問題。K83.20 (Intrahepatic cholestasis, unspecified) 是最直接的編碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness: N/V, dizziness, poor appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, +chills and sweats** - 這些是症狀，但由於有明確的膽道阻塞診斷，這些症狀通常被視為膽道阻塞的表現，除非有其他獨立的診斷需要單獨編碼。

4.  **History of Present Illness: breast ca s/p treatment** - 這是患者的既往病史。Z85.3 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast) 是乳腺癌的個人病史編碼。
5.  **History of Present Illness: ate sausage at ___ on ___ and started having diarrhea after this** - 這是一個具體的事件，導致了腹瀉。R19.7 (Diarrhea due to other specified causes) 是其他原因引起的腹瀉的編碼。
6.  **History of Present Illness: lisinopril was increased 1 month ago from 10mg a day to 30mg/day and she had some dizziness/difficulty tolerating so currently taking 20mg/day** - 這表明患者對利尿劑有不良反應，導致暈眩。T46.1X5A (Adverse effect of ACE inhibitors) 是ACE抑制劑的不良反應編碼，R42.1 (Dizziness) 是暈眩的症狀編碼。
7.  **Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP** - 這是進行的診斷和治療程序。Z49.81 (Encounter for other endoscopic procedures) 是其他內視鏡程序的編碼。
8.  **Imaging: CT chest that showed Mild intra and extrahepatic biliary and pancreatic duct dilation similar to ___** - 這進一步證實了膽道擴張，支持 K83.20 的診斷。

逐步推理：
1.  **progressive symptoms of cervical myelopathy**：這是患者就診的主要原因，也是手術的直接原因。這對應於脊髓病變，ICD-10 編碼為 G96.2 (Cervical myelopathy)。
2.  **spinal cord compression at C6-C7**：這是導致脊髓病變的具體原因，即脊髓受壓。ICD-10 編碼為 M48.06 (Spinal cord compression, cervical region)。
3.  **prior posterior cervical decompression and fusion**：這表示患者有脊柱融合術的病史。ICD-10 編碼為 Z90.0 (Presence of other specified surgical implant, prosthesis, and graft)。
4.  **ACDF C6-C7**：這是手術的具體類型，即前路頸椎融合術。雖然這不是診斷碼，但通常會在病例中記錄以描述治療。在 ICD-10-PCS 中，這會被編碼為一個手術程序碼，但問題僅要求 ICD-10 診斷碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Painless jaundice (無痛性黃疸)**: 這是患者就診的主要原因，且後續檢查證實為膽道問題。K75.10 (Obstructive jaundice, unspecified) 是最合適的編碼，因為它涵蓋了膽道阻塞引起的黃疸。
2.  **ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction (ERCP 並括約肌切開術和結石取出)**: 這是一個手術程序，但對於診斷編碼，我們需要找出導致手術的病因。
3.  **Decompressed bile duct (萎縮性膽管)**: 這是一個重要的發現，表明膽道存在阻塞。K76.4 (Cholelithiasis with cholecystitis and cholangitis) 通常用於膽結石伴膽囊炎和膽管炎，但在此病例中，膽囊炎和膽管炎並未明確提及。然而，K76.4 也涵蓋了膽結石引起的膽道阻塞，這與萎縮性膽管和結石的存在相符。
4.  **Two large gallstones (兩個大膽結石)**: 這直接支持 K76.4 的診斷，即膽結石。
5.  **Mildly hyperemic gallbladder (輕度充血性膽囊)**: 這表明膽囊炎，進一步支持 K76.4。
6.  **Bloodstream infection (血流感染)**: 患者曾因血流感染入院，但病歷中未明確說明感染源。由於患者有膽道問題，且膽道感染是血流感染的常見來源，因此 K75.30 (Unspecified cholangitis) 是合理的編碼，表示膽管炎。
7.  **History of CAD (冠狀動脈疾病)**: I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 是最常見的編碼，表示原發性冠狀動脈的動脈粥樣硬化性心臟病，且無心絞痛。
8.  **AS (主動脈瓣狹窄)**: I35.0 (Aortic valve stenosis) 是主動脈瓣狹窄的正確編碼。
9.  **St. ___ AVR (St. ___ 人工主動脈瓣)**: Z95.1 (Presence of aortic valve prosthesis) 表示存在人工主動脈瓣。
10. **Pulmonary hypertension (肺高血壓)**: I27.29 (Other pulmonary hypertension) 是其他類型肺高血壓的編碼。
11. **Afib on Coumadin (心房顫動，服用華法林)**: I48.91 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation) 表示未特指的心房顫動，Z79.01 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants) 表示長期使用抗凝劑。
12. **Aspirin allergy (阿司匹林過敏)**: Z91.011 (Allergy to aspirin) 是阿司匹林過敏的正確編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: n/v/d (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)**：這些是主要症狀，但需要根據後續診斷和檢查結果來編碼。
2.  **History of Present Illness (HPI) - ""flagyl-resistant C. difficile colitis""**：這是患者近期的診斷，且在本次就診中CT檢查也顯示""stable wall thickening of the rectum and sigmoid colon c/w colitis""，這強烈指向了結腸炎。由於患者曾有抗Flagyl（甲硝唑）的抗性，且目前仍在服用Vancomycin，這表明是難治性或復發性。因此，最合適的編碼是 A04.7 (Toxic megacolon due to Clostridium difficile)。
3.  **HPI - ""melena"" (黑便)**：這是結腸炎的常見症狀，且在本次就診中患者有""mucousy stools""和""loose stools""，以及""increasing nausea, one episode of nonbloody/nonbilious vomiting""，這些都支持消化道出血。因此，K92.2 (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, unspecified) 是適當的編碼。
4.  **HPI - ""headache throughout the day""**：這是本次就診中的一個症狀，R51.0 (Headache) 是適當的編碼。
5.  **Past Medical History (PMH) - HTN (高血壓)**：R09.0 (Hypertension) 是適當的編碼。
6.  **PMH - DVT/PE on rivaroxaban**：I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism, unspecified) 是肺栓塞的編碼，Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants) 是長期使用抗凝劑的編碼。
7.  **PMH - ""two recent admissions, one for PN (DC ___)""**：PN (Pneumonia) 是肺炎，J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism) 是適當的編碼。
8.  **PMH - ""two week PO vancomycin course which she completed on ___""**：這表明患者有抗藥性或復發性，因此 Z51.11 (Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy) 是適當的編碼，表示正在進行抗微生物治療。
9.  **Labs - leukocytosis to 11.3 w/75.1% PMNs**：這表示白血球增多，D72.829 (Leukocytosis, unspecified) 是適當的編碼。
10. **Labs - INR 2.1**：這表示凝血功能異常，D68.69 (Other specified coagulation defects) 是適當的編碼。
11. **Labs - AST 75, ALT 19**：這表示肝功能異常，R94.1 (Abnormal liver function tests) 是適當的編碼。
12. **Labs - Lipase 41**：這表示胰臟功能異常，R94.2 (Abnormal pancreatic function tests) 是適當的編碼。
13. **CT ab/pelvis showed stable wall thickening of the rectum and sigmoid colon c/w colitis**：這再次確認了結腸炎的診斷，A04.7 已經涵蓋了這一點。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
A04.7, K92.2, R51.0, R09.0, I26.9, Z79.01, J18.9, Z51.11, D72.829, D68.69, R94.1, R94.2

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Confusion (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴為意識混亂，且病史中提到「2 days of AMS with visual hallucinations and hypomania」，這表明存在急性意識狀態改變。因此，R41.81 (Acute confusional state) 是一個合適的編碼。
2.  **Dementia (PMH):** 患者有「hx dementia」，這是一個慢性病史。F03.90 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance) 是一個合適的編碼，因為沒有提到行為障礙。
3.  **HTN (PMH):** 患者有「HTN」，這是一個慢性病史。I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是一個合適的編碼。
4.  **Cholangitis c/b Klebsiella bacteremia s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy (PMH):** 患者有膽管炎病史，且目前有膽管引流管。K83.50 (Cholangitis, unspecified) 是一個合適的編碼。此外，Klebsiella bacteremia 是一個重要的感染原因，B96.3 (Klebsiella as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) 是一個合適的編碼。
5.  **Recent admission ___ for acute cholecystitis c/b hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation (attributed to volume overload, possibly due to sepsis) s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy placement:** 患者有急性膽囊炎病史，且目前有膽囊引流管。K81.00 (Acute cholecystitis without cholelithiasis) 是一個合適的編碼。此外，膽囊引流管的存在表明存在膽囊引流，Z99.89 (Other specified surgical and medical device implants) 是一個合適的編碼。
6.  **Biliary drain intact (CT abdomen):** 膽管引流管的存在表明存在膽管引流，Z99.89 (Other specified surgical and medical device implants) 是一個合適的編碼。
7.  **CXR concerning for PNA:** 胸部 X 光顯示肺炎。J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism) 是一個合適的編碼。
8.  **Slurred speech and R leg dragging:** 這些是神經學症狀，可能與意識混亂或基礎神經退化性疾病（如失智症）相關。R47.0 (Speech articulation disorder) 和 R27.1 (Hemiplegia) 是合適的編碼。
9.  **Visual hallucinations:** 視覺幻覺是意識混亂的一部分，但也可以單獨編碼。R29.1 (Hallucinations) 是一個合適的編碼。
10. **Hypomania:** 輕躁狂是意識混亂的一部分，但也可以單獨編碼。F31.12 (Bipolar I disorder, current episode hypomanic, single episode) 是一個合適的編碼，假設這是輕躁狂的一次發作。
11. **Biliary drain removal ___ (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 膽管引流管移除是本次就診的主要手術。Z45.81 (Encounter for removal of other specified internal prosthetic devices, implants and grafts) 是一個合適的編碼。
12. **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions:** 沒有已知的過敏史，因此不需要編碼。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Dyspnea on Exertion (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要主訴，但通常會被更特定的診斷所涵蓋。在這種情況下，由於存在支氣管-氣管軟化症，呼吸困難是其症狀，而不是獨立的診斷。
2.  **Bronchotracheomalacia (Chief Complaint):** 這是患者就診的主要原因，也是導致呼吸困難的根本原因。ICD-10 編碼 J84.11 用於描述支氣管-氣管軟化症。
3.  **Flexible Bronchoscopy, Dynamic Maneuvers, Rigid Bronchoscopy, Stent Placement (Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure):** 這些是診斷和治療的程序，而不是診斷本身。它們通常不直接對應 ICD-10 編碼，除非是用於描述診斷的檢查結果。
4.  **Allergies: Robaxin / nitrofurantoin:** 這些是患者的過敏史，應使用 Z91.011 (Allergy to other drugs, medicaments and biological substances) 來表示。
5.  **Stent Placement:** 這是一個治療程序，通常不直接對應 ICD-10 編碼，除非是用於描述診斷的檢查結果。在這種情況下，它表明了支氣管-氣管軟化症的嚴重程度和治療方式，但 J84.11 已經涵蓋了診斷本身。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Altered mental status** - 這是主要的就診原因，但通常會有更具體的診斷碼來解釋。
2.  **History of Present Illness: ETOH abuse w/ history of DT & recent history of AMS apparently undergoing outpatient work-up** - 這明確指出患者有酒精濫用史，且有酒精戒斷症候群 (DT) 的病史。酒精戒斷症候群 (Delirium Tremens) 是一個重要的診斷，對應 ICD-10 編碼 F10.10 (Alcohol dependence with delirium)。
3.  **History of Present Illness: long standing heavy alcohol use, worsening cognition with word finding difficulty over last ___ years, urinary incontinence, personality changes and memory impairment (not recognizing siblings) over last ___ months** - 這些症狀描述了慢性酒精使用導致的認知功能障礙，包括語言困難、尿失禁、性格改變和記憶障礙。這些症狀符合酒精性痴呆 (Alcoholic dementia) 的診斷，對應 ICD-10 編碼 F10.70 (Alcohol dependence with other alcohol-induced mental disorder)。
4.  **History of Present Illness: became acutely agitated towards his family and he assaulted his wife. 911 was called and brought the patient to ___** - 患者因急性躁動和攻擊行為被送醫，這符合酒精戒斷症候群 (Delirium Tremens) 的急性表現，進一步支持 F10.10 的診斷。
5.  **History of Present Illness: In ___ ED, initial vital signs were: 97.9 90 135/79 20 98% RA** - 這些生命跡象未顯示其他急性問題。
6.  **History of Present Illness: Exam notable for: Somnolent, rousable, protecting airway. Was noted to be intermittently agitated, pulling at lines, biting at restraints** - 這些是酒精戒斷症候群的典型表現，支持 F10.10。
7.  **History of Present Illness: Labs were notable for chem7 with K of 6.5 (hemolyzed, repeat 3.6) bicarb 21, LFTs with AST 59, otherwise WNL. Trop negative x 1, urine tox screen negative aside from pos barbs (s/p pheno dose at OSH)** - 高血鉀 (6.5) 是一個重要的實驗室異常，對應 ICD-10 編碼 E87.5 (Hyperkalemia)。AST 59 較高，但未達到肝功能衰竭的標準，因此不編碼為肝功能衰竭。尿液毒理學篩查陽性為巴比妥酸鹽 (barbs)，這與酒精戒斷症候群的治療相關，但通常不作為主要診斷碼，除非是主要的就診原因。
8.  **History of Present Illness: Patient was initially admitted to the medicine floor. On arrival to the floor, the patient has poor attention, and refuses to answer most questions. He is able to say his first and last name (___) and notes his home address as the place he believes he is. He does not tell us the year. RN notes that marijuana was found in his possession. He was tremulous and required four point restraints.** - 患者在到達病房時有注意力不集中、拒絕回答大多數問題、無法回答年份等症狀，這進一步支持了酒精性痴呆 (F10.70) 和酒精戒斷症候群 (F10.10) 的診斷。發現大麻 (marijuana) 在其身上，這是一個藥物濫用的證據，對應 ICD-10 編碼 F14.90 (Cannabis abuse, uncomplicated)。患者因震顫和需要四點約束，這表明其症狀嚴重，需要緊急處理，這也支持了酒精戒斷症候群 (F10.10) 的診斷。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   F10.10 (Alcohol dependence with delirium) - 酒精依賴伴戒斷症候群 (Delirium Tremens)，是患者急性就診的主要原因，也是其慢性酒精使用導致的嚴重表現。
*   F10.70 (Alcohol dependence with other alcohol-induced mental disorder) - 酒精依賴伴其他酒精誘發的精神障礙，涵蓋了患者的認知功能障礙、語言困難、尿失禁、性格改變和記憶障礙等慢性症狀。
*   E87.5 (Hyperkalemia) - 高血鉀，是患者的重要實驗室異常。
*   F14.90 (Cannabis abuse, uncomplicated) - 大麻濫用，是患者身上發現大麻的證據。

逐步推理：
1.  **Neck Pain s/p Trauma**: 這是主要的主訴，且後續描述為被4英寸的匕首刺傷頸部。這直接指向頸部的穿透性創傷。最合適的 ICD-10 編碼是 S18.20XA (Unspecified penetrating wound of neck, initial encounter)。
2.  **stabbed in neck with a 4-inch stiletto**: 這進一步明確了頸部創傷的性質，是刺傷。S18.20XA 已涵蓋此類穿透性創傷。
3.  **worsening throat pain, jaw pain, and some dysphagia**: 這些是刺傷後的症狀，可能與創傷本身或其後果相關。S18.20XA 已涵蓋了頸部創傷，而這些症狀通常會被包含在創傷的編碼中，除非有更特定的診斷。
4.  **no other injuries**: 這排除了其他部位的創傷。
5.  **tetanus shot was UTD**: 這表示破傷風疫苗是更新的，不構成診斷或需要編碼的問題。
6.  **Allergies: Haldol / codeine**: 這表示患者對Haldol和codeine過敏。Haldol (Haloperidol) 的過敏反應編碼為 Z91.011 (Allergy to haloperidol)。Codeine 的過敏反應編碼為 Z91.012 (Allergy to codeine)。

逐步推理：
1.  **Neutropenic fever (Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness):**  The patient presents with neutropenic fever, which is a critical condition requiring immediate attention. This is the primary reason for admission. The ICD-10 code for this is **R50.81** (Fever due to neutropenia).
2.  **Myxofibrosarcoma (History of Present Illness):**  The patient has a history of myxofibrosarcoma, which is a malignant tumor. This is a significant underlying condition. The ICD-10 code for malignant neoplasm of soft tissue (myxofibrosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma) is **C49.1** (Malignant neoplasm of other specified connective and other soft tissues).
3.  **Cycle 3 AIM (History of Present Illness):**  The patient is undergoing chemotherapy (AIM likely refers to a specific chemotherapy regimen). The fact that he is on cycle 3 indicates that this is an ongoing treatment. The ICD-10 code for the administration of antineoplastic drugs is **Z51.11** (Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy).
4.  **Mild constipation (History of Present Illness):**  The patient reports mild constipation. This is a symptom that should be coded. The ICD-10 code for constipation is **K59.00** (Constipation, unspecified).
5.  **Allergies: ACE Inhibitors (Allergies):**  The patient has an allergy to ACE inhibitors. This is an important piece of information for treatment and management. The ICD-10 code for allergy to ACE inhibitors is **Z91.013** (Allergy to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors).
6.  **Pegfilgrastim administration (History of Present Illness):**  The patient received pegfilgrastim at home after discharge. This is a specific drug used to stimulate white blood cell production. The ICD-10 code for the administration of pegfilgrastim is **Z79.01** (Long term (current) use of other antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs).

逐步推理：
1.  **Weakness, confusion**: 這些是主要的主訴，也是中風的常見症狀。由於患者有中風病史，且目前表現出這些症狀，最合理的解釋是中風的急性發作。因此，I63.5 (Cerebral infarction, unspecified site) 是最合適的編碼。
2.  **Pre-stroke mRS 3**: 這表示患者在中風前的中風殘障程度為3級，這是一個重要的病史資訊，應編碼為Z86.73 (Personal history of cerebral infarction with moderate disability)。
3.  **Pacemaker and lead extraction**: 這是一個主要的外科手術，表明患者有植入式心臟起搏器。因此，Z95.1 (Presence of cardiac pacemaker) 是必要的。
4.  **Anticoagulant**: 患者正在服用抗凝血劑，這是一個重要的用藥史，應編碼為Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)。
5.  **Iodinated Contrast Media allergy**: 患者對含碘造影劑過敏，這是一個重要的過敏史，應編碼為Z91.011 (Allergy to iodinated contrast media)。
6.  **t-PA not administered: anticoagulant**: 這是一個重要的臨床決定，表明患者因服用抗凝血劑而無法接受t-PA治療。這應編碼為Z51.89 (Other specified circumstances affecting health status and contact with health services) 來表示影響就診的其他情況。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：I63.5, Z86.73, Z95.1, Z79.01, Z91.011, Z51.89。

逐步推理：
1.  **Cervical laminectomy C4-6 with fusion revision C3-T1**: 這是一個手術程序，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
2.  **C5-C6 vertebral adenocarcinoma and extradural mass**: 這是一個原發性腫瘤，位於C5-C6椎體和 extradural。腺癌的 ICD-10 編碼是 C79.51 (Malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified parts of spinal cord)。由於是原發性，且位於椎體，C79.51 是最合適的。
3.  **Acute LUE and LLE weakness**: 這是急性四肢無力，是主要的主訴。由於是急性且與脊髓壓迫相關，最合適的編碼是 G83.20 (Paraplegia, unspecified)。雖然患者有雙側無力，但 G83.20 通常用於截癱，而 G83.21 (Paraplegia, incomplete) 用於不完全性截癱。由於病史中提到有殘留的 RUE 無力，且 LUE 突然惡化，這更符合不完全性截癱。
4.  **Residual RUE weakness after this**: 這是殘留的右上肢無力，應編碼為 R27.0 (Paralysis of upper extremity)。
5.  **Incontinent of urine and stool**: 這是尿失禁和糞失禁，應編碼為 R33.8 (Other specified urinary incontinence) 和 R15.8 (Other specified bowel disorders)。
6.  **Hemorrhagic stroke**: 病史中沒有提到中風，因此不編碼。
7.  **RHD (Rheumatic Heart Disease)**: 這是慢性心臟病史，應編碼為 I38.9 (Rheumatic heart disease, unspecified)。
8.  **Allergies**: 這些是重要的病史，應編碼為：
    *   Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin)
    *   Z91.012 (Allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics)
    *   Z91.013 (Allergy to cephalosporins)

    *   Z91.010 (Allergy to other specified drugs)
    *   Z91.011 (Allergy to penicillin) 重複，但已包含。
9.  **Recent corpectomy and instrumentation**: 這是手術，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
10. **Spinal fusion C4 through T1**: 這是手術，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
11. **Posterior instrumentation C3-C4 through C7-T1**: 這是手術，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
12. **Posterior arthrodesis C4 through T1**: 這是手術，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
13. **Allograft, morselized**: 這是手術材料，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
14. **Hematology-oncology, radiation therapy, orthopedics, and palliative care**: 這些是就診科室，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
15. **Discharge to ___**: 這是出院去向，不是診斷，因此不編碼。
16. **Acute decreased mobility**: 這是導致尿失禁和糞失禁的原因，但已經有 R33.8 和 R15.8 來表示這些症狀，因此不單獨編碼。
17. **Denies saddle anesthesia**: 這是對症狀的否認，不是診斷，因此不編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: dyspnea** - 呼吸困難是主要症狀，但通常會被更明確的診斷所取代。
2.  **PMHx of fibromyalgia** - 纤維肌痛症是慢性病史，編碼為 M79.7。
3.  **PMHx of distant vasovagal syncope s/p pacemaker placement and generator removal** - 這是一個複雜的病史。患者有血管迷走性暈厥的病史，並曾植入和移除起搏器。由於起搏器已移除，且沒有提及目前的起搏器狀態，因此不編碼起搏器相關的 ICD-10 編碼。暈厥本身是過去的事件，且未提及目前有暈厥症狀，因此不編碼 R55.81 (Syncope and collapse, unspecified)。
4.  **Three weeks of fevers, chills, and dyspnea on exertion recently diagnosed with a pneumonia** - 這描述了肺炎的症狀和診斷。肺炎本身是主要診斷，編碼為 J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism)。發燒和寒戰是肺炎的症狀，通常包含在 J18.9 中，除非需要單獨編碼。
5.  **now found to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology** - 心包積液伴心包填塞是主要的急性診斷。心包填塞是急症，編碼為 I31.9 (Cardiac tamponade, unspecified)。心包積液是其原因，編碼為 I30.9 (Pericardial effusion, unspecified)。
6.  **Pericardial Drain Placement** - 心包引流是手術程序，通常不編碼為診斷，除非有併發症。
7.  **Allergies: Aspirin / Penicillins / Garlic / Milk / Codeine** - 所有過敏史都應編碼。阿司匹林過敏編碼為 Z88.0 (Allergy to aspirin)。青黴素過敏編碼為 Z88.2 (Allergy to penicillin)。大蒜過敏編碼為 Z88.81 (Allergy to other specified substances)。牛奶過敏編碼為 Z88.82 (Allergy to other specified foods)。可待因過敏編碼為 Z88.81 (Allergy to other specified substances)。
8.  **Progressive symptoms where she became dyspneic with minimal movement, and therefore presented to the ___ ED. She also reports pleuritic chest pain during that time and shoulder pain worse than her fibromyalgia pain.** - 這些是肺炎和心包填塞的症狀，通常包含在主要診斷中。
9.  **She has not traveled recently. She denies joint swelling or changes in urine color/quantity. She continues to have low-grade fevers.** - 這些是排除其他診斷的資訊，不需單獨編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
*   **I31.9 (Cardiac tamponade, unspecified)** - 心包填塞是主要的急症。
*   **I30.9 (Pericardial effusion, unspecified)** - 心包積液是心包填塞的原因。
*   **J18.9 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism)** - 肺炎是主要的診斷。
*   **M79.7 (Fibromyalgia)** - 慢性病史。
*   **Z88.0 (Allergy to aspirin)** - 阿司匹林過敏。
*   **Z88.2 (Allergy to penicillin)** - 青黴素過敏。
*   **Z88.81 (Allergy to other specified substances)** - 可待因和大蒜過敏。
*   **Z88.82 (Allergy to other specified foods)** - 牛奶過敏。

4.  **Lactose intolerance**：患者提到「problems with bowels that he attributes to lactose intolerance」，L01.81 (Lactose intolerance) 是最合適的編碼。
5.  **Hip pain**：患者提到「sweat with exertion but he attributes that to his hip pain」，M25.57 (Other specified pain in joint) 是最合適的編碼。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Hypoxemic respiratory failure (Chief Complaint):** 患者因「Hypoxemic respiratory failure」入院，且病歷中多次提到「intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure」，這是最主要的診斷。對應 ICD-10 編碼 J96.00 (Acute respiratory failure, unspecified, without mention of hypoxia)。雖然病歷中提到「hypoxemic」，但 J96.00 通常用於未明確指出低氧血症的急性呼吸衰竭，而 J96.01 (Acute respiratory failure, with hypoxia) 用於明確指出低氧血症的病例。由於病歷中沒有明確指出低氧血症的具體血氧值或診斷，因此 J96.00 是更合適的選擇。
2.  **ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome):** 病歷中多次提到「ARDS」，且是導致呼吸衰竭的主要原因。對應 ICD-10 編碼 J80 (Acute respiratory distress syndrome)。
3.  **Positive flu swab (Influenza):** 患者有「positive flu swab」，且有「cough, fevers, chills, myalgias」等流感症狀。對應 ICD-10 編碼 J10.1 (Influenza with other respiratory manifestations)。
4.  **Tamiflu (Oseltamivir) administration:** 患者接受了抗病毒藥物 Tamiflu，這表明流感是近期的診斷。因此，J10.1 是必要的。
5.  **Bilateral PTX (Pneumothorax):** 患者有「small to moderate bilateral PTX, likely secondary to barotrauma」，且已進行「bilateral chest tube placement」。對應 ICD-10 編碼 J86.0 (Pneumothorax, unspecified)。
6.  **Swollen neck and crepitus:** 患者有「swollen neck and crepitus」，這通常與氣胸相關，但由於已明確診斷為氣胸，因此 J86.0 已涵蓋此症狀。
7.  **PMH of DM (Diabetes Mellitus):** 患者有「PMH of DM」，但病歷中未明確指出是 1 型或 2 型。因此，使用 E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) 作為預設。
8.  **PMH of HLD (Hyperlipidemia):** 患者有「PMH of HLD」。對應 ICD-10 編碼 E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)。
9.  **Steroid use (Solumedrol, Prednisone):** 患者接受了「3d course of IV solumedrol」和「converted to oral prednisone」，這表明使用了類固醇。對應 ICD-10 編碼 Z79.5 (Long term (current) use of corticosteroids)。

逐步推理：
1.  **N/V (Nausea and Vomiting):** 患者主訴為N/V，且病歷中提到他有大量排便後嘔吐一次。這直接對應於 K59.0 (Gastroenteritis and colitis due to food poisoning)。雖然病歷中提到嘔吐是因為大量排便後，但這仍屬於胃腸炎的症狀。
2.  **Ambinal Pain:** 患者主訴為腹痛，病歷中描述為「diffusely tender and distended abdomen」，這直接對應於 K31.81 (Other specified intestinal obstruction)。這是一個合理的診斷，因為腹痛和腹脹是腸道阻塞的典型症狀。
3.  **Hypoxia:** 患者在ED中被發現有低氧血症，且在使用鼻導管後有所改善。這對應於 R09.02 (Hypoxia)。
4.  **Distended loops of bowel on CXR:** 胸部X光顯示腸道擴張，這進一步支持了腸道阻塞的診斷 (K31.81)。
5.  **NGT placed with feculent output and he started to pass flatus and feel better:** 胃管放置後有糞便樣物質排出，並開始排氣，這表明腸道阻塞有所緩解，但並未完全解決，因此仍需考慮腸道阻塞的診斷。
6.  **Surgery consulted in ED, plan for serial exams and GI consult to consider scope/stent:** 手術科會診並計劃進行進一步檢查和胃腸科會診，考慮內視鏡或支架，這進一步支持了腸道阻塞的診斷。
7.  **PMHx notable for widely metastatic neuroendocrine tumor with limbic encephalitis treated with IVIG, rituximab and steroids:** 患者有廣泛轉移的神經內分泌腫瘤病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，對應於 C7A9 (Other specified malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified sites)。此外，他有腦葉腦炎病史，這是一個神經系統的慢性疾病，對應於 G31.89 (Other specified encephalitis)。
8.  **Myeloid leukemia:** 患者有骨髓性白血病病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，對應於 C92.0 (Acute myeloid leukemia)。
9.  **DM2 (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus):** 患者有第二型糖尿病病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，對應於 E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)。
10. **Dementia:** 患者有失智症病史，這是一個重要的慢性疾病，對應於 F03.90 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance)。
11. **Hay Fever Allergy:** 患者有花粉熱過敏史，這是一個重要的過敏史，對應於 Z91.011 (Allergy to pollen)。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **Chief Complaint: Encephalopathy** - 患者主訴為肝性腦病變，且病史中明確提到「worsening encephalopathy」，且檢查發現「+asterixis」，這直接指向肝性腦病變。因此，K72.9 (Hepatic encephalopathy, unspecified) 是主要診斷。
2.  **History of EtOH cirrhosis** - 患者有酒精性肝硬化病史，且目前的肝性腦病變是其併發症。因此，K70.30 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver without ascites) 是重要的基礎疾病。
3.  **EtOH-related seizures** - 患者有酒精相關性癲癇病史。因此，F10.210 (Alcohol dependence with alcohol-induced seizures) 是相關的診斷。
4.  **SBP (Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)** - 患者有自發性細菌性腹膜炎病史。因此，K73.9 (Other specified diseases of liver) 用於表示肝臟的其他特定疾病，而 K71.9 (Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, unspecified) 用於表示自發性細菌性腹膜炎。
5.  **Recurrent alcoholic hepatitis** - 患者有反覆酒精性肝炎病史。因此，K70.10 (Alcoholic hepatitis without cirrhosis) 是相關的診斷。
6.  **Severe malnutrition** - 患者有嚴重營養不良病史。因此，E40.9 (Severe protein-calorie malnutrition, unspecified) 是相關的診斷。
7.  **Multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma** - 患者有肝細胞癌病史。因此，C22.0 (Malignant neoplasm of liver) 是相關的診斷。
8.  **Increased fatigue, sleeping most of the day, walking into walls, increased nausea** - 這些是肝性腦病變的症狀，已由 K72.9 覆蓋。
9.  **Not taking lactulose regularly** - 這是一個導致肝性腦病變惡化的因素，但本身不是一個疾病，因此不編碼。
10. **Last drink of alcohol was on ___** - 這表明患者目前仍處於酒精依賴狀態，因此 F10.210 (Alcohol dependence with alcohol-induced seizures) 已涵蓋。
11. **Glucose > 500 in ED** - 這是一個急性症狀，但病歷中未提及進一步的診斷或治療，且未明確指出為糖尿病，因此不編碼。
12. **No evidence ascites on bedside ultrasound** - 這表示目前沒有腹水，因此 K70.30 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver without ascites) 中的「without ascites」是正確的。
13. **A&Ox3, following commands** - 這表示患者有輕度意識障礙，但 K72.9 (Hepatic encephalopathy) 已涵蓋。
14. **+asterixis** - 這是一個肝性腦病變的體徵，已由 K72.9 覆蓋。
15. **Decreased strength in bilateral lower extremities** - 這是一個症狀，但病歷中未明確指出是肝性腦病變的直接結果，也未提及神經學檢查的進一步發現，因此不編碼。

逐步推理：
1.  **Uncontrolled back pain (Chief Complaint):** 患者主訴是無法控制的背部疼痛，這是一個症狀。由於病史中提到是L5分布的放射性疼痛，且有神經學檢查和手術的跡象，這更可能指向一個特定的診斷，而不是單純的背痛。因此，R20.2 (Back pain) 可能不是最精確的選擇。
2.  **Severe right-sided radicular pain roughly L5 distribution, down the back of the thigh down through the back of the calf and into the ankle:** 這描述了L5神經根的放射性疼痛，是腰椎間盤突出的典型症狀。因此，M54.16 (L5 radiculopathy) 是一個合理的選擇。
3.  **H/o back problems and a spinal cord stimulator with Dr. ___:** 患者有脊髓刺激器的病史，這是一個植入的醫療設備。因此，Z95.810 (Presence of other specified implantable devices) 是必要的。
4.  **Spinal cord stimulator infection concern:** 神經外科會診是因為懷疑脊髓刺激器感染。這是一個重要的診斷，需要編碼。因此，T84.818A (Infection and inflammatory reaction due to other specified implantable devices, initial encounter) 是必要的。
5.  **Elevated WBC of 20.6:** 白細胞計數升高是感染的客觀證據，支持脊髓刺激器感染的診斷。
6.  **H/o back problems:** 患者有腰椎問題的病史，這是一個慢性疾病。因此，M54.5 (Other intervertebral disc displacement) 是合理的。
7.  **Spinal cord stimulator:** 患者有脊髓刺激器，這是一個植入的醫療設備。因此，Z95.810 (Presence of other specified implantable devices) 是必要的。
8.  **Gabapentin started:** 患者已開始服用加巴噴丁，這是一個用於治療神經性疼痛的藥物。因此，Z79.89 (Other long term (current) drug therapy) 是合理的。
9.  **Unable to tolerate the pain and unable to wait 8 weeks for surgery:** 患者因疼痛無法忍受而提前就診，這是一個就診原因，但不是一個診斷。因此，不編碼。

總結出最合理的編碼集合：
M54.16 (L5 radiculopathy), T84.818A (Infection and inflammatory reaction due to other specified implantable devices, initial encounter), Z95.810 (Presence of other specified implantable devices), M54.5 (Other intervertebral disc displacement), Z79.89 (Other long term (current) drug therapy)

逐步推理：
1.  **Chest pain (recurrent, exertional, central, tightness, diffuse, continuous, worse with deep inspiration, improved sitting forward, radiates to back and left arm, wakening from sleep, 0.4 SL NTG with improvement)**: 這些症狀描述了心絞痛，特別是勞力型心絞痛。因此，I20.1 (Angina pectoris due to atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery) 是最合適的編碼。
2.  **Severe aortic stenosis**: 這是患者的既往病史，也是導致 AVR 的原因。I35.0 (Aortic stenosis) 是正確的編碼。
3.  **6 months s/p AVR with bioprosthetic valve**: 這表示患者曾接受主動脈瓣膜置換術，使用生物瓣膜。Z95.5 (Presence of aortic valve prosthesis) 是正確的編碼。
4.  **Post-op pericarditis**: 這是 AVR 之後的併發症，且目前仍有症狀。I30.1 (Pericarditis, unspecified) 是正確的編碼。
5.  **Known 40% mid-LAD occlusion**: 這是導致心絞痛的基礎病因。I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) 是正確的編碼。
6.  **Hypertension**: 這是患者的既往病史。I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension) 是正確的編碼。
7.  **Cardiac catheterization**: 這是本次就診的主要手術或侵入性程序。009.41 (Cardiac catheterization) 是正確的編碼。
8.  **Adverse effect of drugs (0.4 SL NTG with chest pain improvement)**: 這表示硝酸甘油的使用，但未提及不良反應。因此，不需要編碼不良反應。
9.  **No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions**: 這表示沒有過敏或不良反應。因此，不需要編碼。

<reasoning>
逐步推理：
1.  **右側面部下垂 (right facial droop)**：這是一個神經學症狀，通常與中風或腦血管意外 (CVA) 相關。在沒有明確診斷為中風的情況下，這通常被編碼為 R27.2 (Facial palsy, unspecified)。
2.  **語言含糊 (slurred speech)**：這是一個神經學症狀，通常與中風或腦血管意外 (CVA) 相關。在沒有明確診斷為中風的情況下，這通常被編碼為 R47.0 (Speech articulation disorder)。
3.  **高血壓 (hypertension)**：患者有高血壓病史，且本次就診時血壓高達 190s，這是一個重要的共病。編碼為 I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)。
4.  **視力改變 (change in vision)**：患者有左側視野缺損 (left visual field cut)。這是一個神經學症狀，通常與中風或腦血管意外 (CVA) 相關。在沒有明確診斷為中風的情況下，這通常被編碼為 H53.1 (Visual field defect)。
5.  **非對比頭部 CT (Noncontrast head CT)**：這是一個影像學檢查，用於排除中風。雖然結果未明確提及，但患者被認為不適合 TPA 或血管內治療，這通常意味著沒有急性中風的證據。因此，不編碼中風本身。
6.  **肺癌 (stage IV lung cancer not on treatment)**：這是患者的既往病史。編碼為 C34.9 (Malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung, unspecified site)。
7.  **DVTs on apixaban (深靜脈血栓形成，服用阿哌沙班)**：這是患者的既往病史。深靜脈血栓形成編碼為 I82.9 (Unspecified deep vein thrombosis)。阿哌沙班是用藥，編碼為 Z79.01 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)。
8.  **Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) allergy (磺胺類抗生素過敏)**：這是患者的過敏史。編碼為 Z91.013 (Allergy to sulfonamides)。
9.  **10 point review of systems performed and notable for the above-mentioned symptoms**：這只是對症狀的總結，不需額外編碼。
