She \\nwas evaluated by Spine team who recommended early mobilization, \\npain control, but no brace required. She was evaluated by ___, \\nand discharged to ___.  \\n - She was discharged home with ___ on ___.  \\n - On ___, she again presented to ___ s/p fall from \\nstanding while trying to reach for a glass of water. She did \\nhave a occipital scalp hematoma, but imaging including ___, \\nC-spine CT, and L hip X-ray were negative for acute process so \\npatient was discharged home.  \\n She now represents with generalized fatigue and diarrhea. In \\nthe setting of opiates for her L5 fracture, the patient has had \\nconstipation (5 days with no BM) for which she took a \"natural \\nlaxative\" the evening prior to presentation.

If specific causes are found, these symptoms are often not coded separately.\\n    *   Diarrhea is a key symptom and a primary reason for presentation.\\n2.  **History of Present Illness (PMH):**\\n    *   **chronic anemia:** The patient has a PMH of chronic anemia and current labs show H/H 7.8/25.4 (baseline Hct 31) with low iron, suggesting iron deficiency anemia. This is an active and significant problem requiring transfusion. -> **D50.0** (Iron deficiency anemia).\\n    *   **osteoporosis:** PMH of osteoporosis, explicitly linked to the L5 fracture. -> **M80.08XA** (Osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, other vertebra, initial encounter for fracture). The L5 fracture is acute and the patient is still on pain control for it, making it a current pathological fracture rather than just osteoporosis without fracture (M81.0).\\n    *   **hypertension:** PMH of hypertension. -> **I10** (Essential (primary) hypertension).\\n    *   **ataxia:** PMH of ataxia. -> **R27.0** (Ataxia, unspecified).\\n    *   **recent L5 fracture in the setting of recurrent falls:** This is already covered by M80.08XA.
