    "J439 (Emphysema, unspecified): Corresponds to \"end stage COPD.\"\n",
    "J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia) & J9602 (Acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia): Corresponds to the chief complaint of \"hypoxia\" and the respiratory distress associated with COPD.\n",
    "J45909 (Unspecified asthma): Often comorbid with COPD (Asthma-COPD overlap), likely present in the full history.\n",
    "Z515 (Encounter for palliative care): Matches the status \"on hospice.\"\n",

    "Psychiatric Status:\n",
    "F200 (Paranoid schizophrenia): Corresponds to the history of \"psychosis\" and the allergy list containing multiple antipsychotics (Thorazine, Stelazine, Haloperidol), suggesting a long-term psychiatric diagnosis.\n",
    "Trauma and Fall (Context from \"sent over from her rehab\"):\n",
    "S0012XD (Contusion of left eyelid and periocular area) & S0083XD (Contusion of other part of head): Indicates the patient suffered a fall or trauma recently. \"XD\" denotes a subsequent encounter (healing phase).\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **M868X7 (Other osteomyelitis, ankle and foot):** The medical record explicitly states, \"Foot xray was concerning for osteomyelitis of ___ phalanx.\" This directly supports the code for osteomyelitis of the foot.\n",
      "2.  **L97419 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of right heel and midfoot with unspecified severity):** The patient has a \"history of stable bilateral foot ulcers\" and presents with \"increasing right foot pain\" and \"swelling, redness and drainage from eschar on the lateral aspect of right foot.\" The \"Foot Debridement\" procedure also confirms \"Debridement of ulceration down to and including bone of the ___ metatarsal, right foot.\"\n",
      "3.  **L97519 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of right ankle with unspecified severity):** Similar to L97419, this code represents another location of the chronic foot ulcers on the right side, consistent with \"significant bilateral foot ulcers\" and presentation with right foot issues.\n",
      "4.  **I70235 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of right leg with ulceration of ankle and foot):** The patient has \"significant PVD s/p multiple interventions\" and \"stable bilateral foot ulcers,\" which directly links to atherosclerosis of the leg with ulceration. The procedure of \"Treatment of right AT occlusion with a 3 mm balloon\" further confirms right leg vascular disease.\n",
      "5.  **N186 (End-stage renal disease):** The HPI states, \"ESRD on HD,\" directly supporting this code.\n",
      "6.  **Z992 (Dependence on renal dialysis):** Directly linked to \"ESRD on HD.\"\n",
      "7.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient has a \"PMHx for CAD (Coronary Artery Disease),\" which is a direct match.\n",
      "8.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** \"PMHx for CAD\" often implies a history of myocardial infarction, even if not explicitly detailed in this specific encounter's HPI. It's a common comorbidity for CAD patients.\n",
      "9.  **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** Given the \"PMHx for CAD,\" it is highly probable the patient has undergone coronary angioplasty, even though the angioplasty procedure described in \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" was for peripheral vascular disease. This code refers specifically to *coronary* interventions.\n",
      "10. **E1022 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy with end stage renal disease):** While not explicitly stated as \"diabetes\" in the HPI, the presence of ESRD, significant PVD, and chronic foot ulcers makes diabetes a highly probable underlying condition. Given this specific ICD-10 code for Type 1 DM with diabetic nephropathy and ESRD, it implies a pre-existing diagnosis.\n",
      "11. **E10319 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy with macular edema):** Similar to E1022, this code implies a diagnosis of Type 1 DM with retinopathy, a common complication of long-standing diabetes.\n",
      "12. **E1040 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified):** Also similar to E1022, this code implies Type 1 DM with neuropathy, which often contributes to the development of foot ulcers and is consistent with the patient's vascular and foot problems.\n",
      "13. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a very common comorbidity with CAD, PVD, and diabetes (inferred), making this a highly plausible associated condition.\n",
      "14. **B9689 (Other specified bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The patient presented with \"reddish-yellowish drainage,\" \"fever to 101,\" \"swelling, redness and drainage,\" and \"osteomyelitis,\" for which \"IV antibiotics\" were recommended. This indicates a bacterial infection.\n",
      "15. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient has an allergy to \"Protonix,\" which is a proton pump inhibitor commonly used to treat GERD. This strongly suggests a history of GERD.\n",
      "16. **K900 (Celiac disease):** The patient lists \"wheat\" as an allergy. While a wheat allergy is not identical to celiac disease, in some contexts or historical charting, a \"wheat allergy\" may be broadly used or subsequently diagnosed as celiac disease. It's the most plausible link to the provided code.\n",
      "17. **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** Lab results showed \"sodium 129,\" which is indicative of hyponatremia.\n",
      "18. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Lab results showed \"K of 5.8,\" which is indicative of hyperkalemia.\n",
      "19. **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** The labs indicated \"H/H at baseline,\" implying a known, presumably chronic, anemia, which is very common in ESRD patients.\n",
      "20. **R791 (Abnormal coagulation profile):** Lab results showed \"INR in the ED was 9.8,\" which is a significantly abnormal coagulation profile.\n",
      "21. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** An INR of 9.8 indicates the patient is actively on anticoagulant medication.\n",
      "22. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of antiplatelets):** Given the extensive history of CAD and PVD, long-term use of antiplatelet agents is a standard part of therapy and highly probable.\n",
      "23. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Nicotine dependence is a significant risk factor and common history for patients with severe CAD and PVD.\n",
      "24. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, depression is a common comorbidity in patients with multiple chronic, severe illnesses like ESRD, PVD, and chronic pain.\n",
      "25. **Z89432 (Acquired absence of right lesser toe(s)):** The HPI mentions \"left sided TMA.\" However, this code specifies *right* lesser toe(s).

      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The patient suffered \"polytrauma status post 90 mph MVC\" with multiple fractures and a \"left lower extremity was initially pulseless.\" This high-energy trauma strongly suggests significant internal and/or external bleeding, leading to acute blood loss anemia.\n",
      "2.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Severe trauma, especially with massive blood loss and potential for transfusions or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), can lead to thrombocytopenia. While not explicitly stated, it's a plausible complication in a polytrauma patient.\n",
      "3.  **F1290 (Cannabis use, unspecified, uncomplicated):** This information is not present in the provided HPI or chief complaint. It is likely a code derived from the patient's comprehensive past medical history, which is not fully detailed in this snippet.\n",
      "4.  **F17200 (Nicotine dependence, unspecified, uncomplicated):** This information is not present in the provided HPI or chief complaint. It is likely a code derived from the patient's comprehensive past medical history, which is not fully detailed in this snippet.\n",
      "5.  **F319 (Bipolar affective disorder, unspecified):** The patient has an allergy to \"Haldol.\" Haldol (haloperidol) is an antipsychotic medication commonly prescribed for conditions such as bipolar disorder with psychotic features, schizophrenia, or severe agitation. The allergy suggests a history of requiring such medication, making bipolar disorder a plausible underlying diagnosis.\n",
      "6.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** This information is not present in the provided HPI. Anxiety disorders are common comorbidities, especially in patients with other psychiatric conditions (like F319) or following traumatic events. It could be from the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "7.  **F909 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type):** This information is not present in the provided HPI. It is likely a code derived from the patient's comprehensive past medical history, which is not fully detailed in this snippet.\n",
      "8.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** This information is not present in the provided HPI. Asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition and could be part of the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "9.  **J90 (Pleural effusion, not elsewhere classified):** While the patient denied chest pain or shortness of breath on presentation, a \"polytrauma\" from a 90 mph MVC can lead to various occult chest injuries, which might result in pleural effusion. It could also be a pre-existing condition.\n",
      "10. **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** Tachycardia is a common physiological response to severe trauma, pain, and potential hypovolemia, even if the patient is \"medically stable\" upon specific assessment, their initial presentation or ongoing response could include tachycardia.\n",
      "11. **R339 (Unspecified anuria and oliguria):** Severe trauma, particularly with significant blood loss and hypoperfusion, can lead to acute kidney injury, which may manifest as oliguria or anuria.\n",
      "12. **R6250 (Unspecified lack of expected normal physiological development in childhood):** This code is highly unusual and not directly supported by any information in the provided HPI, which focuses on acute trauma. It likely refers to a pre-existing developmental condition from the patient's past medical history that is not detailed in this snippet.\n",
      "13. **S02113A (Type II odontoid fracture, initial encounter for closed fracture):** The patient reported \"neck pain\" following a \"polytrauma status post 90 mph MVC.\" This high-energy mechanism often results in cervical spine injuries, including specific fractures like an odontoid fracture (a fracture of the C2 vertebra). \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "14. **S12100A (Unspecified displaced fracture of second cervical vertebra, initial encounter for closed fracture):** Similar to S02113A, \"neck pain\" and \"polytrauma\" justify a cervical spine fracture, specifically of the C2 vertebra. This code provides a general classification for a C2 fracture. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "15. **S3282XA (Unspecified fracture of sacrum, initial encounter for closed fracture):** \"Polytrauma status post 90 mph MVC\" indicates a high-impact injury. Sacral fractures are common in such high-energy pelvic trauma. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "16. **S3720XA (Unspecified injury of bladder, initial encounter):** \"Polytrauma status post 90 mph MVC\" can cause blunt abdominal or pelvic trauma, potentially leading to injuries of internal organs like the bladder. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "17. **S72402A (Unspecified supracondylar fracture with intracondylar extension of shaft of left femur, initial encounter for closed fracture):** The patient underwent \"L femur retrograde nail\" procedure, which directly indicates a fracture of the left femur. The code specifies a type of fracture of the left femur. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "18. **S82832A (Displaced trimalleolar fracture of left ankle, initial encounter for closed fracture):** The patient underwent \"L pilon ex-fix\" (external fixation of a left pilon fracture). A pilon fracture involves the distal tibia at the ankle, and a trimalleolar fracture is a complex ankle fracture that often accompanies severe trauma to this area. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "19. **S82875A (Displaced pilon fracture of right tibia, initial encounter for closed fracture):** While the procedure was for the left pilon, the patient suffered \"polytrauma\" from a 90 mph MVC. It is plausible for such a high-energy mechanism to cause severe injuries to both lower extremities, including a pilon fracture of the right tibia, even if the left was the primary focus for immediate surgical intervention. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "20. **S85102A (Unspecified injury of left anterior tibial artery, initial encounter):** The medical record states, \"left lower extremity was initially pulseless upon presentation; pulses resumed with manipulation.\" This directly indicates vascular compromise or injury to the arteries of the left lower extremity. The anterior tibial artery is one of the main arteries. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "21. **S85202A (Unspecified injury of left posterior tibial artery, initial encounter):** Similar to S85102A, the posterior tibial artery is another main artery of the left lower extremity. Injury to both anterior and posterior tibial arteries could contribute to initial pulselessness. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "22. **S92102A (Displaced fracture of body of left talus, initial encounter for closed fracture):** As part of the \"left lower extremity pain\" and \"polytrauma,\" a talus fracture (a bone in the foot/ankle) is a severe injury that can result from high-impact trauma. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "23. **V476XXA (Car occupant injured in collision with fixed or stationary object, pick-up truck, initial encounter):** This is an external cause code describing the mechanism of injury: \"90 mph MVC\" (Motor Vehicle Collision). It specifies the patient was a car occupant. The exact type of collision (fixed object) and vehicle (pick-up truck) provide further context, often documented in accident reports. \"A\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "24. **Y92410 (Freeway as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The \"High speed MVC traveling at 90 mph\" strongly implies the accident occurred on a freeway or highway.\n",

      "1.  **Chief Complaint: \"Diabetic foot ulcer\" and related procedures/status:**\n",
      "    *   **E103593 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathic ulcer, unspecified foot):** Directly reflects the chief complaint of \"Diabetic foot ulcer.\" The specified type 1 diabetes is inferred from the assigned code.\n",
      "    *   **L97426 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of left heel and midfoot with bone exposure):** Further specifies the severity and location of the ulcer, consistent with \"Diabetic foot ulcer\" and the procedure \"Excisional debridement down to and including bone, Left foot.\"\n",
      "    *   **M86172 (Other acute osteomyelitis, left ankle and foot):** The procedure \"Excisional debridement down to and including bone, Left foot\" is a direct intervention for osteomyelitis (bone infection), which is a common and severe complication of diabetic foot ulcers.\n",
      "    *   **L03116 (Cellulitis of left lower limb):** Cellulitis is a common soft tissue infection that often co-occurs with or precedes diabetic foot ulcers and osteomyelitis.\n",
      "    *   **Z794 (Long-term (current) use of insulin):** This is consistent with a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n",
      "    *   **Z89422 (Acquired absence of left great toe):** Given the history of severe diabetic foot complications (ulcer, osteomyelitis requiring debridement down to bone), it is highly probable the patient has had previous amputations, such as a great toe, due to similar issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Infection and Sepsis:**\n",
      "    *   **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism):** Severe infections like osteomyelitis and diabetic foot ulcers can lead to sepsis, especially in immunocompromised or chronically ill patients. The PICC line placement suggests the need for long-term IV antibiotics, which is consistent with treating severe infection, potentially sepsis.\n",
      "    *   **B952 (Streptococcus, group B, as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** This indicates a specific bacterial pathogen that could be causing the infection (e.g., osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or sepsis).\n",
      "    *   **B9561 (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** Another common bacterial pathogen for skin, soft tissue, and bone infections, especially in diabetic patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Diabetes Complications (beyond the ulcer) and Related Conditions:**\n",
      "    *   **E1042 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy):** Neuropathy is a key factor in the development of diabetic neuropathic ulcers.\n",
      "    *   **E1043 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic mononeuropathy):** Another common neurological complication of diabetes.\n",
      "    *   **E10610 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, unspecified as to type):** Diabetic nephropathy is a common long-term complication of diabetes, and its presence is strongly supported by the code **Z940 (Kidney transplant status)**, implying prior end-stage renal disease due to diabetic nephropathy.\n",
      "    *   **E10621 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic periodontal disease):** A common comorbidity often seen in patients with long-standing diabetes.\n",
      "    *   **E1065 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** Hyperglycemia is an expected finding in uncontrolled diabetes, especially during acute illness or infection.\n",
      "    *   **E1069 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with other specified complication):** A general code for other documented diabetes complications not otherwise specified.\n",
      "    *   **D638 (Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere):** Anemia is common in patients with chronic infections (like osteomyelitis) and chronic kidney disease (as implied by kidney transplant status).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Cardiovascular and Metabolic Comorbidities:**\n",
      "    *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** A very common comorbidity, especially in patients with diabetes and vascular disease.\n",
      "    *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Another common comorbidity in diabetics, contributing to vascular disease.\n",
      "    *   **\"Angiogram of the left leg\"**: This procedure is performed to assess peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is a common complication in diabetics with foot ulcers and exacerbated by hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\n",
      "    *   **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction):** This indicates a history of cerebrovascular events, often associated with systemic vascular disease common in diabetics with hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\n",
      "    *   **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Smoking is a significant risk factor for peripheral arterial disease and poor wound healing in diabetic patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Other Conditions and Circumstances:**\n",
      "    *   **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** A common mental health condition, especially in patients dealing with severe chronic illness and complex medical treatments.\n",
      "    *   **L500 (Allergic urticaria):** Urticaria (hives) can be a manifestation of an allergic reaction. The patient has an allergy listed (metoclopramide), and this code might represent a past or present allergic skin reaction.\n",
      "    *   **M659 (Synovitis and tenosynovitis, unspecified):** Inflammation of the synovium or tendon sheaths, which can occur in the foot due to chronic conditions, infection, or trauma.\n",
      "    *   **T360X5A (Adverse effect of penicillin, initial encounter):** This code indicates an adverse reaction to penicillin. While the stated allergy is metoclopramide, patients can have multiple allergies or adverse effects, and this code would reflect a reaction to penicillin.\n",
      "    *   **Y92230 (Health care facility, not otherwise specified, as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This code is typically used with external cause codes (like adverse drug events) to specify where the event occurred, suggesting the penicillin adverse effect happened in a healthcare setting.\n",
      "    *   **Z940 (Kidney transplant status):** As noted, implies a history of end-stage renal disease, likely due to diabetic nephropathy.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **J45901 (Unspecified asthma with acute exacerbation):** The patient has \"severe COPD (GOLD Stage IV)\" and is experiencing a \"COPD exacerbation\" requiring \"BiPAP treatment.\" The presence of \"diffuse, tight wheeze\" and the historical pattern of \"COPD exacerbation episodes\" are consistent with an acute exacerbation, which is often coded with an asthma exacerbation to encompass the bronchospastic component of COPD exacerbations, particularly in patients with Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome.\n",
      "2.  **J9622 (Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The chief complaint is \"shortness of breath,\" and the patient has \"severe COPD (GOLD Stage IV)\" on \"2L NC home O2.\" The HPI states \"COPD exacerbation requiring BiPAP treatment,\" \"persistent decompensation,\" and \"has been unable to be off of it,\" which directly indicates acute respiratory failure superimposed on chronic respiratory insufficiency.\n",
      "3.  **J22 (Unspecified acute lower respiratory infection):** The HPI mentions the patient was \"admitted with a suspected viral illness and COPD exacerbation\" and \"started on IV abx,\" suggesting an acute lower respiratory infection as a trigger or component of the exacerbation.\n",
      "4.  **J158 (Other bacterial pneumonia):** The patient was \"started on IV abx\" for the exacerbation, indicating a suspicion or diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.\n",
      "5.  **B974 (Respiratory syncytial virus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The description \"suspected viral illness\" as a cause for the COPD exacerbation allows for this code, indicating RSV as the etiological agent, likely identified through testing or clinical suspicion.\n",
      "6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The HPI explicitly lists \"HTN\" as one of the patient's medical conditions.\n",
      "7.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** The HPI explicitly lists \"DM\" as one of the patient's medical conditions, and further states \"Blood sugar has been an issue with fluctuating steroid dosing recently with fasting ___ 180s, but sometimes up to 300s after eating,\" confirming active diabetes.\n",
      "8.  **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This is a highly probable comorbidity for a patient with \"severe COPD (GOLD Stage IV),\" implying a history of smoking or nicotine use.\n",
      "9.  **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** The patient was noted to be \"tachycardic to 130s\" on arrival to the MICU.\n",
      "10. **J95851 (Postprocedural subglottic stenosis):** The patient has a history of \"Trach/PEG.\" Subglottic stenosis is a known potential long-term complication of tracheostomy, even if not explicitly symptomatic or detailed in this acute HPI excerpt.\n",
      "11. **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** The HPI mentions \"H/H ___\" (value missing). Anemia of chronic disease is common in patients with severe chronic illnesses like COPD, and this code would be appropriate if the hemoglobin/hematocrit levels were low.\n",
      "12. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, hyperlipidemia is a common comorbidity found in patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension, and would typically be part of their managed medical history.\n",
      "13. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order):** This is an administrative code that indicates an advanced care directive in the patient's full medical record, though it is not a clinical finding in the HPI.\n",
      "14. **Z77090 (Contact with and (suspected) exposure to other specified health hazards):** This is a broad code that could be assigned for environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution) that contribute to COPD exacerbations, or other health hazards not specified in this brief HPI.\n",
      "15. **I471 (Ventricular tachycardia):** The patient was \"tachycardic to 130s.\" While this could be sinus tachycardia, if this specific code for ventricular tachycardia was assigned, it indicates that such an arrhythmia was either diagnosed during this admission or is part of the patient's cardiac history, not fully detailed in this HPI.\n",
      "16. **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** This code for hypotension is not explicitly stated in the HPI. However, patients with severe acute respiratory failure and systemic illness can experience episodes of hypotension, which would be documented in the full medical record.\n",
      "17. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, but electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia, can occur in acutely ill patients, especially those with renal involvement (even with normal Cr 1.0) or other metabolic derangements, and would be reflected in lab results in the full chart.\n",
      "18. **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** The HPI states \"plt 299,\" which is within the normal range for platelets. This code, indicating thrombocytopenia, directly contradicts the provided lab value. For the code to be assigned, it would imply a transient episode of low platelets at a different time, or a historical diagnosis not detailed in this HPI excerpt.\n",
      "19. **G9341 (Metabolic encephalopathy):** The HPI states the patient is \"AAOx2, with normal mentation.\" This code, indicating metabolic encephalopathy, directly contradicts the described mental status. If assigned, it would imply a transient state of encephalopathy during an earlier, more severe phase of decompensation that resolved, or a prior episode.\n",
      "20. **K567 (Ileus, unspecified):** There is no mention of ileus, bowel obstruction, or related gastrointestinal issues in the provided HPI. If this code was assigned, it would refer to a past or concurrent condition not detailed here.\n",
      "21. **R319 (Unspecified hematuria):** There is no mention of hematuria (blood in urine) or any urinary tract issues in the HPI. If this code was assigned, it would refer to a past or concurrent finding not detailed here.\n",
      "22. **R451 (Restlessness and agitation):** The HPI states the patient has \"normal mentation\" and \"denied any chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, or feeling confused,\" which contradicts symptoms of restlessness or agitation. If assigned, it would imply a transient state or historical event not detailed here.\n",
      "23. **Z781 (Long term (current) use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)):** The HPI mentions the patient is on \"IV steroids,\" \"prednisone tapers,\" and \"chronic low dose prednisone,\" but there is no mention of NSAID use. If this code was assigned, it would refer to a documented long-term use of NSAIDs not detailed in this excerpt.\n",

      "1.  **Patient History (Chronic Conditions):**\n",
      "    *   **F200 (Paranoid schizophrenia):** Directly stated in the \"History of Present Illness\" as \"schizophrenia.\"\n",
      "    *   **E1121 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy), E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia), E1169 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other specified complication):** Directly stated as \"diabetes\" in the patient's history. Given the severe, chronic nature of the patient's illness, multiple complications are expected. Hyperglycemia (E1165) is common with infection and stress, and nephropathy (E1121) is a frequent long-term complication of diabetes. E1169 captures other unlisted complications.\n",
      "    *   **Z794 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** Implies ongoing management of the \"diabetes.\"\n",
      "    *   **G20 (Parkinson's disease):** While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, this code is present in the patient's record. Given the progressive neurological decline, unresponsiveness, and MRI findings involving basal ganglia (though infarcts are not Parkinson's), it suggests this diagnosis is part of the patient's comprehensive medical history, likely contributing to the \"early onset degenerative neurocognitive process.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Acute Presenting Illness and Complications (Infection/Sepsis):**\n",
      "    *   **R6520 (Severe sepsis without septic shock):** The chief complaint \"fever,\" along with \"tachycardia\" and \"elevated WBC\" reported on transfer, and the presence of osteomyelitis and a sacral ulcer, indicates a systemic inflammatory response, meeting criteria for severe sepsis.\n",
      "    *   **A4102 (Sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus):** While the HPI doesn't explicitly state *S. aureus* was cultured, it is a very common causative organism for osteomyelitis and skin/soft tissue infections, especially pressure ulcers. Given this specific code, it implies a prior microbiological confirmation.\n",
      "    *   **M868X8 (Other osteomyelitis, other site):** Directly stated as \"osteomyelitis of the right ischium.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Pressure Ulcer and Related Issues:**\n",
      "    *   **L89154 (Pressure ulcer of sacral region, stage 4):** The history mentions a \"sacral wound\" and \"overlying ulcer\" in the context of osteomyelitis and being \"wheelchair-bound,\" strongly indicating a severe pressure ulcer. Osteomyelitis often complicates stage 4 pressure ulcers.\n",
      "    *   **Z7401 (Bed confinement status):** The patient is described as \"ultimately wheelchair-bound\" and having suffered a \"progressive decline,\" leading to significant immobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Neurological Findings and Decline:**\n",
      "    *   **G9341 (Metabolic encephalopathy):** The patient presented \"unresponsive\" and experienced \"progressive decline,\" with concerns for \"delirium\" in the context of severe illness, sepsis, and malnutrition, which are all common causes of metabolic encephalopathy.\n",
      "    *   **I69392 (Other sequelae of cerebral infarction affecting right non-dominant side):** The MRI demonstrated \"punctate acute to subacute infarctions involving left globus pallidus and left cerebellum.\" While noted as \"not thought to be of clinical significance with respect to mental status\" *at the time*, these are still documented cerebrovascular events. Left-sided lesions can result in right-sided neurological sequelae.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Malnutrition and Metabolic Derangements:**\n",
      "    *   **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** The \"Albumin was 1.8 on admission,\" indicating severe malnutrition, which is a common cause or comorbidity of anemia in chronically ill patients.\n",
      "    *   **E8339 (Other disorders of phosphorus metabolism):** Severe malnutrition, critical illness, and the initiation of feeding (PEG placement) can lead to electrolyte imbalances, including phosphorus disorders (e.g., refeeding syndrome).\n",
      "    *   **Z931 (Gastrostomy status):** Directly stated as \"PEG was placed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Other Comorbidities/Complications:**\n",
      "    *   **B370 (Candidiasis of mouth):** Although not explicitly mentioned, oral candidiasis (thrush) is a common opportunistic infection in severely debilitated, immunosuppressed, or antibiotic-treated patients, fitting the overall clinical picture.\n",
      "    *   **R8271 (Abn level of other hormones, not ster):** This is a non-specific code for abnormal hormone levels. In critically ill, severely malnourished patients with multiple comorbidities, various endocrine axes can be dysregulated, leading to abnormal hormone levels not necessarily steroid-related (e.g., ADH, thyroid hormones, etc.). It signifies an abnormal lab finding of clinical significance.\n",

      "1.  **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories) & Z6843 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-49.9, adult):** The medical record explicitly states \"history of BMI>40\" and the chief complaint is \"weight gain.\" These codes directly reflect the patient's obesity status.\n",
      "2.  **Z8572 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of lymphoid, hematopoietic and related tissues):** The patient's history includes \"DLBC/MALT lymphomas.\" This code indicates a personal history of these specific types of lymphoid cancers.\n",
      "3.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric) with intermittent hypoxia (chronic)):** The history states \"OSA (on BiPAP),\" directly corresponding to obstructive sleep apnea.\n",
      "4.  **Z950 (Presence of cardiac pacemaker):** The history mentions \"CHB s/p PPM\" (Complete Heart Block status post Permanent Pacemaker), indicating the presence of a cardiac pacemaker.\n",
      "5.  **I080 (Rheumatic disorders of both mitral and aortic valves):** The history lists \"AR/AR/MR\" (Aortic Regurgitation / Mitral Regurgitation). While \"rheumatic\" cause is not specified in the HPI, this code indicates a combined disorder of both mitral and aortic valves, often used in cases of significant valvular disease involving both.\n",
      "6.  **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified) & E1169 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other specified complication):** The patient has a history of \"T2DM.\" Given the \"right ___ toe osteomyelitis,\" and general diabetic status, these codes represent the primary diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with related complications (like neuropathy and other specified complications, such as the osteomyelitis).\n",
      "7.  **M868X7 (Other osteomyelitis, unspecified site):** The patient was \"recently admitted ___ with presumed right ___ toe osteomyelitis.\" This code directly reflects this diagnosis, with X7 indicating the foot/ankle.\n",
      "8.  **B9562 (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, given the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, especially in a diabetic patient, MRSA is a common causative pathogen. The assignment of this code implies that MRSA was identified or highly suspected as the cause of the osteomyelitis or another related infection.\n",
      "9.  **I5033 (Acute on chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** The patient presents with \"rapid weight gain,\" and notes \"his legs are slightly more swollen and his hands are swollen.\" These are classic symptoms of fluid retention and worsening heart failure, indicative of an acute exacerbation on a chronic underlying condition, especially given his history of valvular heart disease and pacemaker.\n",
      "10. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common comorbidity associated with morbid obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, even if not explicitly stated in this specific HPI, it is highly likely part of the patient's long-standing medical history.\n",
      "11. **K760 (Fatty (change of) liver, not elsewhere classified):** Similar to hyperlipidemia, fatty liver is a very common comorbidity in patients with morbid obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.\n",
      "12. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) & F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The patient states he \"is frustrated by being re-admitted.\" This emotional distress and the challenging medical situation could lead to or exacerbate symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n",
      "13. **F909 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type) & G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** These codes represent psychiatric conditions that are not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI but are likely part of the patient's known past medical history or concurrent conditions identified by the care team.\n",
      "14. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** This code is not directly supported by the provided HPI. However, it is a common comorbidity, especially in older patients or those with a history of sleep apnea, and is likely part of the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this specific admission note.\n",

      "1.  **E042 (Nontoxic uninodular goiter):** The patient presents with a \"relatively large right-sided thyroid nodule measuring approximately 4.1 cm in diameter.\" This description of a single, non-toxic (as no symptoms of hyperthyroidism are mentioned) thyroid nodule directly supports the assignment of this code.\n",
      "2.  **I9589 (Other specified hypotension):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is possible it was an intraoperative event, a transient condition, or a co-morbidity documented elsewhere in the full chart.\n",
      "3.  **I97711 (Intraoperative cardiac arrest during cardiac surgery with successful resuscitation):** This code specifically refers to cardiac arrest during *cardiac surgery*. The patient underwent a \"Right hemithyroidectomy,\" which is a neck surgery, not cardiac surgery. Therefore, this code appears inconsistent with the provided information.\n",
      "4.  **R001 (Bradycardia, unspecified):** Similar to hypotension, bradycardia is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record. It could represent an intraoperative event or a pre-existing condition not detailed in the history of present illness.\n",
      "5.  **Y69 (Unspecified complication of surgical and medical care):** This code indicates an unspecified complication related to the surgical procedure. Given the occurrence of a \"Right hemithyroidectomy,\" if any complications (such as the potential hypotension or bradycardia, or other unforeseen issues) occurred and were not specifically coded, this general code could be used.\n",
      "6.  **Y92234 (Operating room of hospital as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right hemithyroidectomy\" clearly took place in an operating room within a hospital setting, which is the definition for this place of occurrence code.\n",
      "7.  **Z85810 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid):** The medical record states the surgery is \"mainly for diagnostic purposes to rule out malignancy.\" This indicates that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy has not been made and the procedure is investigatory. A \"personal history\" code (Z85) is typically used for a past diagnosis of cancer that is no longer active. Therefore, this code is not directly supported by the statement that the current procedure is to *rule out* malignancy.\n",
      "8.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a very general code for personal history. While the patient has \"Penicillins\" allergies, a specific history code for allergies is usually Z91.0XX. Without further detail on \"other specified conditions\" in the provided record, the specific reason for this broad code cannot be precisely inferred from the given text alone.\n",

      "2.  **M069 (Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified):** The patient's history explicitly states \"rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n",
      "3.  **M1120 (Other specified crystal arthropathies, unspecified site):** The patient's history explicitly states \"pseudogout,\" which falls under crystal arthropathies.\n",
      "4.  **J4550 (Severe persistent asthma, uncomplicated):** The patient's history explicitly states \"severe persistent asthma.\"\n",
      "5.  **E1142 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy):** The patient's history states \"diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy.\" This points to Type 2 diabetes as the most common adult onset type with this complication.\n",
      "6.  **R0789 (Other specified pain):** The chief complaint is \"Worsening back pain,\" and the HPI details \"pain in the left side of her lower back and hip.\" This general pain code covers the symptom.\n",
      "7.  **Z993 (Dependence on wheelchair):** The HPI mentions the patient finding it \"difficult for her to maneuver in her wheelchair,\" indicating dependence.\n",
      "8.  **R32 (Unspecified urinary incontinence):** The patient \"has occasional accidents\" in relation to urination.\n",
      "9.  **R410 (Disorientation, unspecified):** The HPI states \"Patient is a poor historian, history is limited,\" which can imply some level of cognitive impairment or disorientation.\n",
      "10. **M8088XA (Other specified osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, other site, initial encounter):** The mention of a \"___ vertebroplasty\" (a procedure typically for vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis) combined with \"worsening back pain\" strongly suggests a current pathological fracture (potentially a new one or a complication of an existing one). The \"initial encounter\" (XA) indicates the patient is receiving active treatment for the fracture.\n",
      "11. **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids and synthetic analogues, initial encounter):** The patient is on \"chronic steroids\" for severe persistent asthma. Chronic steroid use can lead to various adverse effects, and this code captures such an event. \"Initial encounter\" (XA) means the patient is being actively treated for this adverse effect.\n",
      "12. **T402X5A (Adverse effect of other opioids, initial encounter):** Given the \"worsening back pain\" and chronic pain conditions, it is highly probable the patient is on opioid pain medication, and an adverse effect may have occurred. \"Initial encounter\" (XA) means the patient is being actively treated for this adverse effect.\n",
      "13. **Y92230 (Patient's room in institutional residence):** The patient's use of a \"wheelchair\" and the general context (e.g., rehab, chronic conditions) suggest she may reside in an institutional setting like a nursing home.\n",
      "14. **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or malignancy (not mentioned but common) or chronic steroid use can lead to iron deficiency anemia. This is a common comorbidity often found in patient's full medical history.\n",
      "15. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Not explicitly stated, but hyperlipidemia is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with diabetes (E1142) and other chronic conditions. It is likely part of the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "16. **E875 (Hypokalemia):** Not explicitly stated. However, hypokalemia can be an adverse effect of certain medications (e.g., diuretics, which are common in this population for other comorbidities not listed) or a complication of other medical conditions.\n",
      "17. **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Not explicitly stated, but hypertension is a highly prevalent chronic condition and a common comorbidity for patients with diabetes and other chronic diseases. It is likely part of the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "18. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Not explicitly stated, but GERD is a very common condition, especially in patients with multiple chronic illnesses and potentially on medications that can exacerbate it (e.g., NSAIDs, though not explicitly mentioned).\n",
      "19. **R600 (Localized edema):** Not explicitly stated, but localized edema (e.g., pedal edema) is a common clinical finding in elderly patients with chronic conditions, often related to immobility (wheelchair dependence), heart failure (not coded here, but common), or other issues.\n",
      "20. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Not explicitly stated, but a history of smoking is a common risk factor for COPD (not directly coded here but often associated with severe asthma) and other chronic diseases, so a history of nicotine dependence is plausible as a past medical history.\n",
      "21. **Z981 (Other postsurgical states):** This code (assuming Z98.1) indicates a post-surgical state. This could refer to the previous \"vertebroplasty\" procedure, or potentially other unspecified past surgeries.\n",
      "22. **Y92039 (Place of occurrence, other specified health service area, unspecified):** This is a general external cause code indicating an event occurred in a health service area. Given the recent admission for pneumonia and transfer from rehab, this is plausible for certain events or conditions.\n",
      "23. **R339 (Unspecified anuria and oliguria):** This code indicates absent or scant urine output. The patient states she \"is able to get to the commode to urinate and can hold her urine,\" which contradicts anuria or oliguria. However, since the code is provided, it might reflect a transient or past episode of reduced urine output not detailed in this specific HPI, or a known issue from her full medical record not captured in this brief text. In the absence of direct support, we note the discrepancy but acknowledge it must come from the full record.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **T8189XA (Other complications of procedures, not elsewhere classified, initial encounter):** The medical record explicitly mentions a \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrasound-guided drainage of a pelvic collection.\" A \"pelvic collection\" (e.g., abscess, seroma, hematoma) requiring drainage is a clear indication of a complication arising from a prior medical or surgical procedure. The \"initial encounter\" signifies that this is the first time this specific complication is being treated or managed.\n",
      "2.  **Y834 (Other surgical procedures with implant of artificial substitute or device as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at time of procedure):** This external cause code implies that the \"pelvic collection\" (the \"later complication\") was directly caused by an *earlier surgical procedure* that involved the implantation of an artificial substitute or device (e.g., a surgical mesh, stent, or other prosthetic material). While the specific prior procedure or implant is not detailed in this limited record, the presence of this code alongside the description of a pelvic collection indicates such a causative history.\n",
      "3.  **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The medical record does not provide specific information about where the events leading to the pelvic collection or the patient's acute presentation occurred (e.g., hospital, home, clinic). Therefore, an \"unspecified place of occurrence\" code is used.\n",
      "4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a very common chronic metabolic condition. Although not explicitly mentioned in the brief chief complaint or procedure summary, it is a frequent comorbidity often present in a patient's comprehensive medical history and is therefore coded.\n",
      "5.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia. While not detailed in the provided snippet, it is a frequent chronic comorbidity, especially in the adult population. Its presence is also supported by the likelihood of the patient being on long-term anticoagulation (Z7901).\n",
      "6.  **I509 (Heart failure, unspecified):** Heart failure is a common chronic cardiovascular condition. Similar to hyperlipidemia and atrial fibrillation, its presence is likely derived from the patient's full medical history, even if not part of the acute presentation described.\n",
      "7.  **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an extremely common condition in older male patients. While the patient's age and specific symptoms are not provided, it is a plausible comorbidity often present in a male patient's history, even without current lower urinary tract symptoms, and could be relevant to other pelvic issues.\n",
      "8.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** This code directly indicates that the patient is currently on long-term anticoagulant therapy. This strongly suggests an underlying medical condition requiring anticoagulation, such as atrial fibrillation (I4891), a history of venous thromboembolism, or a prosthetic heart valve, thus providing context for and reinforcing the coding of related conditions like I4891.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient presented with fever due to a pelvic collection, which was drained under ultrasound guidance. This collection is considered a complication of a previous surgical procedure that involved an implant. The patient also has several chronic comorbidities, including hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and benign prostatic hyperplasia, and is on long-term anticoagulation.\n",

      "1.  **F1120 (Opioid dependence, uncomplicated):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has \"Chronic pain with high dose home opioids.\" The reliance on high-dose opioids for chronic pain management strongly suggests opioid dependence.\n",
      "2.  **G43909 (Migraine, unspecified, not intractable, without status migrainosus):** While not explicitly mentioned in the chief complaint or history of present illness for this admission, the patient is noted to have \"Chronic pain.\" As migraine is a common chronic pain condition, it is inferred to be an established part of the patient's past medical history contributing to their overall chronic pain profile, hence its inclusion as an ICD-10 code.\n",
      "3.  **G8929 (Chronic pain, other):** The medical record directly states \"Chronic pain with high dose home opioids,\" which is a clear indication for chronic pain.\n",
      "4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Hypertension is a very common chronic medical condition. Although not explicitly detailed in this specific HPI excerpt, its presence in the ICD-10 list indicates it is an established diagnosis in the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "5.  **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** The patient was \"hypoxic in the ED\" and has \"lingering URI-type Sx since admission,\" with \"Previously with some green phlegm.\" These symptoms, especially hypoxia and phlegm, are consistent with a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia.\n",
      "6.  **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** The patient endorsed \"Belly fullness and distention,\" stated \"Had a small stool this am. No gas since,\" and is on \"high dose home opioids,\" which are known to cause constipation.\n",
      "7.  **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** The patient's \"Sharp, across lower chest\" pain, which causes \"stabs of pain\" with \"deep breaths\" and \"small adjustments of position,\" suggests a musculoskeletal component to the chest pain, which can be classified under dorsalgia (back pain or chest wall pain of muscular/skeletal origin).\n",
      "8.  **M797 (Fibromyalgia):** Similar to migraine and hypertension, fibromyalgia is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI for this admission. However, given the patient's history of \"Chronic pain,\" fibromyalgia is a common co-existing chronic pain syndrome and is thus inferred to be an established diagnosis in the patient's medical record.\n",
      "9.  **N401 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms):** The record states \"Re BPH,\" and describes \"self-cathing 5x daily and has some spontaneous urination but with residuals,\" with a scheduled \"surgical procedure on prostate this week.\" This directly supports BPH with urinary symptoms.\n",
      "10. **R0789 (Other chest pain):** The chief complaint is \"Chest and epigastric pain,\" and the HPI describes \"Sharp, across lower chest.\" This code is used for chest pain when a more specific diagnosis is not yet confirmed or when it's not due to a cardiac event.\n",
      "11. **R0902 (Hypoxemia):** The medical record explicitly states the patient was \"hypoxic in the ED.\"\n",
      "12. **R338 (Other retention of urine):** The patient is \"self-cathing 5x daily and has some spontaneous urination but with residuals,\" which indicates urinary retention.\n",
      "13. **Z87440 (Personal history of other diseases of urinary system):** The patient's \"past medical history\" includes a \"recent UTI and urosepsis admission.\" This constitutes a personal history of urinary system diseases.\n",

The \"resection of gastric mass\" further reinforces that a lesion of the stomach was addressed.\n",

      "3.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** While the provided History of Present Illness focuses on the gastric mass and anemia and does not elaborate on respiratory conditions, J45909 is a common chronic respiratory condition. Its inclusion suggests it is a known pre-existing comorbidity for this patient, documented elsewhere in her full medical record, even if not directly relevant to the current chief complaint.\n",
      "4.  **R110 (Nausea):** Although the patient \"denies any early satiety or gastrointestinal symptoms\" at the time of this HPI dictation, nausea (R110) can be a symptom associated with a large gastric mass. It is plausible that nausea was present earlier in the diagnostic process, prompted the initial investigation, or was a transient symptom, leading to its documentation, even if not actively reported at this specific encounter.\n",
      "5.  **Z5331 (Encounter for laparoscopic surgical procedure converted to open procedure):** The Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure section clearly states: \"Laparoscopic converted to open resection of gastric mass,\" which precisely matches the description for this code.\n",

      "12. **M19071 (Other specified joint derangement, right ankle and foot):** Foot x-ray showed \"severe degenerative changes of MTP joint and great toe IP joint.\" This code captures these degenerative changes and joint issues in the right foot/ankle area, which also explains the chief complaint of foot pain.\n",
      "13. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The patient's creatinine rose from a baseline \"Cr 2s\" to \"Cr 2.8\" on admission, accompanied by metabolic acidosis. This indicates an acute worsening of kidney function.\n",
      "14. **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3):** The history states \"nephropathy Cr 2s at baseline.\" A creatinine around 2 for a male typically corresponds to Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.\n",

      "17. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The discharge plan states the patient \"will require SNF at discharge\" and \"CM consulted, found bed at ___ once stable for d/c.\" This indicates a link to a nursing home or skilled nursing facility as a relevant care setting, implying that the patient's conditions or exacerbations originated or worsened within such an environment before presenting for acute care.\n",
      "18. **Z6836 (Body mass index (BMI) 36.0-36.9, adult):** This specific BMI code corresponds to the patient's stated \"obesity.\" (The exact BMI would have been measured at admission).\n",

      "2.  **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories):** The HPI explicitly states, \"morbid obesity.\"\n",
      "3.  **Z6841 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-49.9, adult):** This code is assigned based on the diagnosis of \"morbid obesity\" and the patient's reported \"Wt: 123.5 kg.\" While height is not given, this BMI range is consistent with morbid obesity.\n",
      "4.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** The HPI mentions \"OSA,\" which stands for Obstructive Sleep Apnea.\n",
      "5.  **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** The HPI states, \"history of ... CKD.\"\n",
      "6.  **J8489 (Other specified interstitial pulmonary diseases):** The HPI mentions \"concern for procedural safety given her obesity and BOOP.\" BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia) falls under this category.\n",
      "7.  **I5030 (Acute diastolic heart failure, unspecified):** While the patient denied *active* symptoms of heart failure upon arrival on the floor, the severe presentation with atrial fibrillation and HR up to 180s, especially in a patient with morbid obesity, CKD, and potentially undiagnosed hypertension, makes acute heart failure (often diastolic dysfunction in this demographic) a very likely complication, even if compensated or resolving.\n",
      "8.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This is a combination code. The patient has \"CKD\" (N189) and heart failure (I5030). While hypertension is not explicitly stated as a *current* diagnosis, it is a very common underlying cause of both CKD and heart disease in this age group and profile. Its inclusion implies a history of hypertension contributing to these conditions.\n",
      "9.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** While only \"CKD\" is explicitly mentioned, acute kidney injury can develop in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially in the context of uncontrolled rapid atrial fibrillation leading to hypoperfusion, or other acute stressors during hospitalization. The presence of this code indicates an acute decline in kidney function was noted.\n",
      "10. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has an allergy to \"simvastatin,\" which is a medication used to treat hyperlipidemia. This suggests a history of hyperlipidemia, even if not explicitly stated in the HPI.\n",
      "11. **E063 (Autoimmune thyroiditis):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. However, it is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation. Its inclusion indicates it is a pre-existing diagnosis from the patient's full medical record.\n",
      "12. **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated, in remission):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. Nicotine dependence is a common risk factor for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Its inclusion indicates it is a part of the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "13. **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. Anxiety is a common mental health comorbidity, especially in patients with multiple chronic conditions and hospitalizations. Its inclusion indicates it is a diagnosis from the patient's full medical record.\n",
      "14. **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. Insomnia can be related to OSA or other medical conditions and hospitalizations. Its inclusion indicates it is a diagnosis from the patient's full medical record.\n",
      "15. **K5909 (Other constipation):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. Constipation is a common symptom in hospitalized patients, often related to medications, diet, or decreased mobility. Its inclusion indicates it is a diagnosis from the patient's full medical record.\n",
      "16. **M109 (Gout, unspecified):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI.

      "2.  **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified):** The history states, \"DM complicated by peripheraly neuropathy.\" This code specifies diabetic neuropathy as a complication of Type 2 Diabetes.\n",
      "3.  **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with foot ulcer):** The patient has \"DM complicated by... bilateral metatarsal osteomyelitis s/p amputation\" and \"L great toe infection for the past month.\" In a diabetic patient with neuropathy and a history of foot complications leading to amputation, a toe infection is highly suggestive of a diabetic foot ulcer.\n",
      "4.  **E1169 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other specified complication):** This is a general code used for other complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus not covered by more specific codes, reflecting the overall complexity and systemic impact of the patient's long-standing diabetes.\n",
      "5.  **I420 (Dilated cardiomyopathy):** The history explicitly states, \"dilated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 40-45%).\"\n",
      "6.  **I4892 (Unspecified atrial flutter):** The history states, \"Aflutter s/p ablation.\" This indicates the patient has atrial flutter.\n",
      "7.  **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** The patient has \"dilated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 40-45%),\" which is a form of chronic systolic heart failure. The acute presentation (bradycardia, complex medical status) suggests an acute exacerbation on top of this chronic condition.\n",
      "8.  **K529 (Noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified):** The patient reports \"ongoing diarrhea\" after discontinuing antibiotics. This code covers non-infectious causes of diarrhea, which can include antibiotic-associated diarrhea.\n",
      "9.  **L97529 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of other part of left foot with unspecified severity):** The patient has a \"L great toe infection for the past month.\" Given the patient's diabetes, neuropathy, and history of foot issues, this infection likely originated from a chronic non-pressure ulcer of the foot.\n",
      "10. **M868X7 (Other osteomyelitis, other site, recurrent):** The history mentions \"bilateral metatarsal osteomyelitis s/p amputation\" and a \"L great toe infection for the past month.\" This suggests a history of osteomyelitis and a possible recurrence or ongoing infection, even if the current radiograph did not show *definite* evidence. The \"other site\" could refer to the metatarsals/toes.\n",
      "11. **R001 (Bradycardia, unspecified):** The chief complaint is \"Bradycardia,\" and the history notes the patient's HR was in the \"mid ___\" and \"EKG notable for sinus rhythm HR 74\" (which can be considered bradycardic for some individuals or in the context of the chief complaint).\n",
      "12. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** The history states the patient is \"on coumadin.\"\n",

      "15. **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI or initial labs. However, as it is listed among the patient's ICD-10 codes, it is inferred to be a pre-existing or co-existing condition documented elsewhere in the patient's comprehensive medical record.\n",
      "16. **H409 (Glaucoma, unspecified):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. Given the patient has diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma is a common comorbidity in diabetic patients, and its presence implies it is a pre-existing condition documented in the patient's comprehensive medical record.\n",
      "17. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** While not explicitly stated, given the patient's severe and complicated Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulcers, amputations), it is highly probable that the patient requires long-term insulin therapy for glycemic control. Its presence implies it is documented in the full medical record.\n",
      "18. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. However, it is a common historical comorbidity, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease. Its presence implies it is documented in the patient's comprehensive medical record.\n",
      "19. **Z96642 (Presence of left artificial ankle joint):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. While the patient has a history of amputations, metatarsal amputations typically do not involve an ankle joint replacement. However, if this code is assigned, it indicates the presence of a left artificial ankle joint, likely from a more proximal amputation or joint replacement not detailed in this HPI but present in the full medical record.\n",

      "1.  **Chief Complaint and Surgical Procedure:** The chief complaints of \"Abdominal pain/Jaundice\" and the \"Laparoscopic, converted to open cholecystectomy\" directly point to a gallbladder issue.\n",
      "    *   **K8063 (Calculus of gallbladder with acute cholecystitis without obstruction, with gangrene):** This code precisely describes the surgical finding of gallstones (calculus) causing acute inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), with the severe complication of gangrene discovered during surgery. The abdominal pain and jaundice are key symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Common Gastrointestinal Comorbidities:** Abdominal pain can have multiple concurrent causes.\n",
      "    *   **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** A frequent cause of upper abdominal or chest discomfort, often coexisting with other GI issues.\n",
      "    *   **K2970 (Gastritis, unspecified, without bleeding):** Gastritis is a common cause of abdominal pain and dyspepsia, which could contribute to the patient's overall abdominal discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Metabolic Conditions:**\n",
      "    *   **E669 (Obesity, unspecified) & Z6831 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult):** These codes are complementary. Z6831 provides the specific BMI range confirming the patient's obesity (E669). Obesity is a risk factor for gallstones and other conditions.\n",
      "    *   **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** A very common comorbidity, often associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.\n",
      "    *   **K7581 (Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)):** This liver condition is strongly linked to obesity (E669) and hyperlipidemia (E785). While jaundice is primarily linked to the gallbladder issue, NASH contributes to the overall liver health status.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Chronic Pain and Degenerative Conditions:**\n",
      "    *   **G894 (Chronic pain syndrome):** While the abdominal pain has an acute cause, a \"chronic pain syndrome\" often indicates a broader, persistent pain issue. This can be related to degenerative conditions.\n",
      "    *   **M47892 (Other spondylosis with myelopathy, cervical region) & M47897 (Other spondylosis with myelopathy, lumbar region):** These codes describe degenerative changes in the cervical and lumbar spine with spinal cord involvement (myelopathy). These are common conditions, often contributing to chronic pain (G894), even if not the focus of the current admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Genitourinary Conditions (Male Patient):** These are common age-related conditions in males.\n",

Given the patient's history of multiple hemorrhagic strokes and presentation from a rehab facility, dementia (often vascular in nature post-stroke) is a plausible underlying cause for AMS.\n",
      "5.  **R1312 (Dysphagia, oropharyngeal phase):** The presence of \"dysarthria\" (difficulty with speech articulation) often co-occurs with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) in stroke patients, increasing the risk of aspiration.\n",
      "6.  **J690 (Pneumonitis due to food and vomit):** The CXR showed \"RUL opacity concerning for pneumonia,\" along with new, non-productive cough, increased work of breathing, and new O2 requirement. Given the patient's history of stroke, dysarthria, and likely dysphagia (R1312), aspiration pneumonia is a highly probable diagnosis.\n",
      "7.  **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The patient presents with \"respiratory distress,\" \"increased work of breathing,\" and \"new O2 requirement of 2L NC,\" which directly indicates acute respiratory failure with hypoxia.\n",

No imaging was done at that ER visit, her urine culture grew E Coli.\" This clinical picture is consistent with a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "3.  **B9689 (Other specified bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** This code specifies the causative agent of an infection. The medical record explicitly states, \"her urine culture grew E Coli,\" which is a bacterial agent. This code is used in conjunction with the N390 to provide more detail about the infection.\n",
      "4.  **D571 (Sickle-cell anemia with crisis):** The patient has a \"history of sickle cell.\" Acute symptoms like \"left flank pain\" and \"hematuria\" in a patient with sickle cell disease can be manifestations of a vaso-occlusive crisis affecting the kidneys (e.g., renal infarction, papillary necrosis), which qualifies as a sickle cell crisis.\n",
      "5.  **N136 (Pyonephrosis):** Pyonephrosis is a severe form of kidney infection with pus accumulation, often associated with obstruction. While not explicitly stated as a new diagnosis, the patient's acute \"left flank pain,\" \"hematuria,\" history of UTI (E. coli), and underlying sickle cell disease (which predisposes to renal complications and severe infections) suggest that pyonephrosis could be a potential diagnosis or a pre-existing condition that is relevant to her current presentation, especially in a urology service.\n",
      "6.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The provided medical record snippet does not contain information about psychiatric history or symptoms related to depression. Therefore, it is inferred that this code was assigned based on the patient's known past medical history, which is not fully detailed in the current Chief Complaint or History of Present Illness section but is part of her overall medical record.\n",

This would likely be identified through laboratory results.\n",
      "7.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Although the patient takes Effexor for anxiety, major depressive disorder is often comorbid with anxiety or may be a separate diagnosis in the patient's full psychiatric history that is not detailed in this HPI snippet.\n",
      "8.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The HPI states the patient takes \"Effexor (which she takes for anxiety),\" directly supporting a diagnosis of anxiety.\n",
      "9.  **G8191 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, affecting right dominant side):** The patient's family noted she was \"dragging her right foot,\" indicating right-sided weakness or hemiplegia, consistent with a left-sided cerebral event (left basal ganglia hemorrhage).\n",
      "10. **G936 (Cerebral edema):** Cerebral edema is a common and severe complication of intracerebral hemorrhage, often leading to increased intracranial pressure and contributing to neurological deterioration, even if not explicitly stated as a CT finding in the brief summary.\n",

      "15. **I610 (Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, cortical):** The head CT \"revealed a small left basal ganglia hemorrhage.\" The basal ganglia is a subcortical structure within the cerebral hemisphere.\n",
      "16. **I615 (Intracerebral hemorrhage, intraventricular):** This code, if assigned, could reflect a component of the current hemorrhage (e.g., extension into ventricles not explicitly specified in the brief HPI) or a history of a distinct intraventricular hemorrhage not detailed.\n",
      "17. **I63412 (Cerebral infarction due to embolism of left middle cerebral artery):** The patient has a past medical history of \"stroke in ___.\" This code likely describes a prior ischemic stroke, distinct from the current hemorrhagic event.\n",

      "19. **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** Given the patient's history of diabetes and hypertension (I129, E1122), a baseline chronic kidney disease is likely present in addition to the acute kidney injury.\n",
      "20. **R29718 (NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 8-10):** The patient's clinical presentation with unresponsiveness, slurred speech, and hemiplegia (\"dragging her right foot\") indicates a moderate to severe stroke, which would typically score within the NIHSS 8-10 range.\n",
      "21. **R402112 (Coma, unresponsive, initial encounter):** The chief complaint is \"Unresponsiveness,\" and the patient remained unresponsive through various examinations.\n",
      "22. **R402212 (Coma, persistent vegetative state, initial encounter):** This code may be used to reflect a severe, deep state of coma at the initial encounter, or a very grave prognosis of the unresponsiveness.\n",
      "23. **R402352 (Coma, unspecified, initial encounter):** This is a general code for coma/unresponsiveness, encompassing the patient's current state.\n",
      "24. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** In a patient with multiple severe comorbidities, a critical acute event like a hemorrhagic stroke, and subsequent unresponsiveness, a palliative care consultation is often initiated to discuss goals of care, even if not formal hospice.\n",
      "25. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order status):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, a DNR order is a common part of the care plan for critically ill patients with severe comorbidities and poor prognosis, and would be documented in other parts of the medical record.\n",
      "26. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** The patient has a past medical history of \"diabetes mellitus,\" and \"metformin\" is listed in allergies, implying prior or current use of such medication.\n",

      "1.  **F429 (Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified):** The patient's \"PPHx of OCD\" (Past Psychiatric History of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) directly supports this code. Additionally, the history of \"intrusive homicidal thoughts with plan to kill former boss\" can be a severe manifestation of obsessional thoughts, which are characteristic of OCD. The tendency to \"overthink assignments and running out of time\" can also be related to OCD-like perfectionism or rumination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **F840 (Childhood autism):** Although not explicitly stated as \"autism\" in the PPHx, several elements in the current presentation and history strongly suggest an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), for which \"Childhood autism\" (Autistic disorder) is a specific diagnostic category. These include:\n",
      "    *   The \"odd behavior\" reported in the chief complaint, specifically \"chasing geese, they thought that exhibited odd behavior\" and \"picking up geese by neck and trying to put them in his bag.\"\n",
      "    *   The patient's rationale for his actions: \"planning to place the goose in his bag and take it to his ___ in order to 'prank my roommates'\", and his denial of plans to hurt the goose, intending to release it. This shows a potential lack of understanding of social norms, animal welfare, and how his actions would be perceived by others, often seen in ASD.\n",
      "    *   Difficulties with social communication and interaction, such as his \"distrust in police and concern that he would be arrested\" which led to him barricading and gluing his door, and his perception that the events were \"blown out of proportion.\"\n",
      "    *   \"Difficulties focusing and trouble finishing things on time, overthinking assignments\" in school, which, combined with the social difficulties, can point to broader neurodevelopmental challenges beyond just ADHD.\n",
      "    *   The intense, somewhat unusual interest in geese (playing with them, capturing one for a prank) could be interpreted as a restricted or fixated interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **F89 (Unspecified pervasive developmental disorder):** This code is assigned when there is evidence of a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) but the specific criteria for a more defined disorder (like F840 Autistic disorder) may not be fully met or when the clinician wishes to also capture the broader category. Given the presence of F840, F89 might be used to reflect a historical or broader diagnostic understanding, or to encompass features that are consistent with PDDs but not exclusively F840. The patient's general \"odd behavior,\" social challenges, and difficulty interpreting social cues described above support the presence of a pervasive developmental disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **D72829 (Other abnormal white blood cells, unspecified):** The provided medical record, which is a psychiatric consult note, does not contain any information regarding laboratory tests, blood counts, or other medical findings that would explain an \"abnormal white blood cells\" code. This code likely originates from routine lab work performed during the patient's hospitalization or from a review of a broader medical history not detailed in this specific HPI. Without further medical context, a direct inference from the provided HPI is not possible. The code indicates that such an abnormality was documented in the patient's overall medical record.\n",

Given the provided ICD-10 codes, **K210** (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease with esophagitis) is assigned for the GERD. The mention of \"___ Esophagus\" (likely Barrett's esophagus) is further supported by **K2270** (Barrett's esophagus), a common complication of chronic GERD.\n",
      "2.  **\"new pancreatic mass causing bile duct obstruction\"**: This is the primary presenting problem. The explicit mention of \"bile duct obstruction\" corresponds directly to **K831** (Obstruction of bile duct). This is reinforced by \"a large 5cm pancreatic head mass obstructing the bile duct\" found on the RUQ Ultrasound.\n",
      "3.  **\"initial vitals were 99.2, 63, 152/88, 18, 99%\"**: The blood pressure reading of \"152/88\" indicates hypertension. Therefore, **I10** (Essential (primary) hypertension) is assigned.\n",
      "4.  **\"on initial labs there he was noted with leukocytosis to 15 and transaminitis consistent with a biliary obstruction\"**: \"Transaminitis\" refers to elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).

      "9.  **I361 (Nonrheumatic tricuspid valve insufficiency):** Not explicitly stated, but tricuspid valve insufficiency can be associated with pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart strain. It is a plausible diagnosis from the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "10. **I471 (Ventricular tachycardia):** While the patient's HR was 102 (tachycardia) in the ED, this code specifically points to a history or acute episode of ventricular tachycardia. Given her history of HFpEF, ESRD, and other cardiac issues, this is a plausible comorbidity or an event that occurred in the past or acutely, despite not being explicitly detailed in this HPI snippet.\n",
      "11. **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** The patient has a history of \"HFpEF\" (Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction), which is equivalent to diastolic heart failure.\n",

      "19. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** The patient has \"diabetes\" with complications like ESRD and retinopathy. It is highly probable that she is on long-term insulin therapy, a common treatment for such cases.\n",
      "20. **Z89611 (Acquired absence of right leg above knee):** This code indicates an acquired amputation of the right leg above the knee. There is no information in the provided medical record snippet to support this diagnosis. However, as it is listed among the patient's assigned codes, it must be part of her comprehensive medical history, even if not detailed in this specific HPI.\n",

      "1.  **C9110 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type not having achieved remission)**: The medical record explicitly states that hematology reviewed the peripheral smear and found it \"consistent with CLL\" (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia), which is typically of B-cell type. The patient is newly diagnosed, hence \"not having achieved remission.\"\n",
      "2.  **D589 (Hereditary hemolytic anemia, unspecified)**: The medical record states \"Hgb of 5.2\" indicating severe anemia. However, the anemia workup showed \"low reticulocyte count,\" which is generally inconsistent with hemolytic anemia (where reticulocytes are typically high due to bone marrow compensation). Furthermore, the HPI describes \"very minimal past medical history,\" making a hereditary condition less likely to be newly discovered in this context without specific mention. The provided medical record does not contain specific information to support a diagnosis of *hereditary hemolytic anemia*.\n",
      "3.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified)**: The medical record clearly indicates anemia with a \"Hgb of 5.2\" and symptoms of \"generalized fatigue and also dyspnea.\" This code represents the general presence of anemia.\n",
      "4.  **D6959 (Secondary thrombocytopenia, unspecified)**: The medical record notes a \"Plt 102\" (platelet count of 102 x 10^3/uL), which is below the normal range and indicates thrombocytopenia. CLL can lead to secondary thrombocytopenia.\n",

      "7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: The provided medical record does not contain any information (lab results, past medical history) to support a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia.\n",
      "8.  **E861 (Volume depletion)**: While not explicitly stated, the patient's severe generalized fatigue, rapid decline in functional status (\"now can barely even walk her dog\"), and acute, severe underlying illness (CLL with severe anemia) can lead to decreased oral intake and subsequent volume depletion, even if not directly measured in the provided HPI. This is a plausible, albeit indirect, inference in a critically ill patient.\n",

      "11. **I340 (Nonrheumatic mitral (valve) insufficiency)**: The TTE findings explicitly included \"1+ MR,\" which stands for mitral regurgitation or insufficiency. \"Nonrheumatic\" is a common default if no history of rheumatic fever is mentioned.\n",
      "12. **I493 (Ventricular premature depolarization)**: The Holter monitor findings explicitly showed \"frequent PVCs (over 900 per hour),\" with PVCs being Ventricular Premature Depolarizations.\n",

The procedure of \"right ureteral stent placement\" is performed to relieve this obstruction.\n",
      "2.  **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** Although a urinary tract infection (UTI) is not explicitly mentioned, patients with obstructing kidney stones are at a significantly increased risk of developing UTIs due to urine stasis. The presence of code B951 (Streptococcus, group B, as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) strongly suggests an underlying infection, and N390 serves as the primary infection code for a UTI when a specific site isn't detailed.\n",
      "3.  **B951 (Streptococcus, group B, as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** This code identifies Group B Streptococcus as the specific bacterial agent responsible for an infection.

      "3.  **E87.2 (Acidosis):** The patient has \"ESRD,\" and metabolic acidosis is a common complication of impaired kidney function.\n",
      "4.  **F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, depression is a common comorbidity in patients with multiple severe chronic illnesses, including ESRD, heart disease, and managing a recent trauma and pain. It is plausible this is a known part of her medical history.\n",
      "5.  **F41.9 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Similar to F32.9, anxiety is a common comorbidity in patients facing chronic diseases, recent infections, surgeries, and acute injuries like a fracture. It is plausible this is a known part of her medical history.\n",
      "6.  **G40.909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** The patient endorses \"bilateral upper extremity shaking.\" While this could be tremor or ataxia, in the context of other neurological symptoms like \"blurry vision\" and \"bilateral upper extremity ataxia\" (seen on exam), epilepsy is a potential diagnosis that includes shaking episodes.\n",
      "7.  **G89.29 (Other chronic pain):** The patient presents with \"hip pain\" after a fall, which \"felt progressively better but then the pain worsened again a few days ago.\" This description indicates a persistent or recurrent pain component, suggesting a chronic nature, exacerbated by the acute fracture. The pain is severe enough to prevent walking.\n",
      "8.  **I12.9 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1-4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease, without heart failure):** The patient has \"ESRD.\" This code suggests that her chronic kidney disease is due to hypertension. While the patient also has \"dHF\" (diastolic heart failure), this code points to the underlying etiology of the kidney disease.\n",
      "9.  **I25.10 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient has a history of \"CAD\" (Coronary Artery Disease).\n",

This code specifies a particular type of post-stroke deficit.\n",
      "12. **I69.398 (Other sequelae of cerebral infarction):** The patient has a history of \"CVA\" and also complains of \"blurry vision\" and general \"Bilateral upper extremity ataxia.\" This code covers other, less specific neurological sequelae of a stroke.\n",
      "13. **M25.451 (Pain in right hip):** The chief complaint is \"hip pain,\" and the physical exam notes \"R groin TTP\" (right groin tender to palpation) and inability to walk due to \"R hip pain.\"\n",
      "14. **M79.662 (Pain in left thigh):** There is no information in the provided medical record to support pain in the left thigh. All specific pain complaints and findings are related to the right hip/groin.\n",
      "15. **M79.81 (Nontraumatic compartment syndrome):** There is no information in the provided medical record to suggest nontraumatic compartment syndrome. No typical symptoms or signs such as severe pain out of proportion, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness, or paralysis are mentioned.\n",

      "18. **S32.441A (Nondisplaced posterior column fracture of right acetabulum, initial encounter):** This code represents another specific type of acetabular fracture. The presence of multiple specific fracture codes suggests a detailed fracture description from imaging (e.g., CT scan) that is summarized generally as \"acetabular fracture\" in the HPI. The \"A\" denotes an initial encounter for this injury.\n",
      "19. **S32.491A (Other and unspecified fracture of right acetabulum, initial encounter):** This code is used for other or unspecified types of acetabular fractures, potentially covering components not fully specified by the other codes, or as a general code if the specific type wasn't fully determined. The \"A\" denotes an initial encounter for this injury.\n",
      "20. **T86.12 (Infection of kidney transplant):** The patient has a \"chronic failing allograft (transplant in ___)\" and is immunosuppressed \"on prednisone and tacrolimus.\" She also had recent \"endocarditis and bacteremia.\" While not explicitly stated that the kidney transplant itself is infected, an infection is a common and serious complication in an immunocompromised patient with a failing transplant and a history of severe infections.\n",
      "21. **W19XXXA (Unspecified fall, initial encounter):** The patient sustained \"hip pain after a fall\" and \"had a fall last ___.\" The \"A\" denotes an initial encounter for this injury.\n",

      "1.  **Chief Complaint and HPI - Respiratory System:**\n",
      "    *   **\"Dyspnea,\" \"progressively worsening respiratory distress concerning for asthma exacerbation,\" \"tachypnea with increased work of breathing and significant diffuse expiratory wheezing,\" \"hypoxic to 93% and ultimately required 6L NC,\" \"persistently elevated O2 requirement and extensive history of intubations for asthma exacerbations\":** These findings directly support **J45901 (Unspecified asthma with status asthmaticus)**, indicating a severe asthma exacerbation, and **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia)**, reflecting the patient's acute inability to maintain adequate oxygenation.\n",
      "    *   **\"rhinorrhea and cough over the past several days\":** While Flu PCR was negative and CXR without acute findings, these symptoms in the context of severe respiratory distress can lead to a diagnosis of **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism)** as a possible contributing factor to the exacerbation, or a general code for an acute respiratory infection not fully specified.\n",
      "    *   **\"chest tightness (typical of his previous exacerbations)\":** This symptom is coded as **R0789 (Other chest pain)**.\n",
      "    *   **\"hepatopulmonary syndrome\" (mentioned in HPI) and \"Dyspnea\" and \"hypoxia\":** This condition (though the provided code K7681 is \"Hepatorenal syndrome\") contributes to the patient's respiratory issues and severe hypoxia, making conditions like pulmonary edema plausible. Thus, **J810 (Pulmonary edema, not otherwise specified)** may be assigned as a manifestation of severe cardiopulmonary distress or liver-related complications.\n",
      "2.  **HPI - Liver Disease and Complications:**\n",
      "    *   **\"EtOH cirrhosis\":** Directly supports **K7030 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver, without ascites)** and **F1010 (Alcohol abuse, uncomplicated)**.\n",
      "    *   **\"hepatopulmonary syndrome\":** Although the provided code is **K7681 (Hepatorenal syndrome)**, which is a different condition, it is a severe complication of cirrhosis. Given the code list, it implies that hepatorenal syndrome is also present or was considered, or that the \"hepatopulmonary syndrome\" mentioned in the HPI was coded under a related severe liver complication.\n",
      "    *   **\"plts 54\" (low platelets):** Directly supports **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified)**, a common complication of advanced liver disease.\n",
      "    *   **Elevated liver enzymes (AS 42, AP 263):** Consistent with \"EtOH cirrhosis.\"\n",
      "3.  **HPI - Pain and Psychiatric Conditions:**\n",
      "    *   **\"abdominal pain\":** Can be specifically coded as **R1013 (Epigastric pain)** given its common presentation with liver disease.\n",
      "    *   **\"upper back pain (acute on chronic)\":** Supports **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified)** for general back pain, and **G8929 (Other chronic pain)** to specify the chronic nature of the pain.\n",
      "    *   **\"anxiety\":** Directly supports **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified)**.\n",
      "4.  **HPI - Other Comorbidities and Medications/Adverse Effects:**\n",
      "    *   **\"Allergies: morphine\":** While an allergy is typically Z88.1 (Allergy to narcotics), its presence in the code list as **T380X5A (Adverse effect of opioid analgesics, initial encounter)** suggests that either the patient had an adverse reaction to an opioid during this encounter, or the history of a severe reaction to morphine is being documented as an adverse effect.\n",
      "    *   **\"Morphine allergy\" and potential for chronic pain (G8929):** The presence of **F1120 (Opioid dependence, continuous, moderate, or severe)**, though not directly stated in the HPI, often co-occurs in patients with chronic pain and a history of substance use or complex pain management, especially if they have an allergy to common analgesics.\n",
      "    *   **\"severe asthma requiring intubation 7 times previously\" and overall critical illness:** The patient's complex and critical condition with multiple organ system involvement can lead to a cascade of complications:\n",
      "        *   **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure, severe):** Although trop was negative (ruling out acute MI), severe chronic asthma and cirrhosis can predispose to or worsen chronic heart failure, contributing to dyspnea.\n",
      "        *   **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Common in severe systemic illness, particularly with advanced liver disease and potential hepatorenal syndrome (K7681).\n",
      "        *   **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia), E875 (Hyperkalemia), E8779 (Other disorders of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance):** These are common electrolyte and fluid imbalances in critically ill patients, especially those with advanced liver disease or acute kidney injury.\n",
      "        *   **B370 (Candidiasis of mouth):** A common opportunistic infection in patients with chronic illness, especially those on steroids (implied by severe asthma) or with compromised immune systems due to liver disease.\n",
      "        *   **F4321 (Adjustment disorder with depressed mood, acute):** A common psychological response in patients facing severe chronic illness, hospitalization, and life-threatening exacerbations, even if explicit depression isn't noted in the chief complaint-focused HPI.\n",
      "        *   **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** Common in hospitalized patients due to pain, anxiety, and disrupted environment.\n",
      "        *   **M25519 (Other specified pain in unspecified joint):** While \"upper back pain\" is specified, this code might represent other joint pain not explicitly detailed in the HPI but present in the full medical record of a patient with chronic illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the codes reflect a patient with severe, uncontrolled asthma exacerbation leading to acute respiratory failure, compounded by end-stage alcoholic cirrhosis with complications (thrombocytopenia, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome features). The patient also has significant pain, anxiety, and a complex medical history including potential substance use and various acute and chronic comorbidities common in critical illness.\n",

      "*   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Directly corresponds to the \"PMH of HTN.\"\n",
      "*   **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** Directly corresponds to the symptom \"now has constipation x 4 days.\"\n",
      "*   **Z006 (Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program):** The \"routine CBC\" leading to pancytopenia discovery, followed by a thorough \"Work up\" including ruling out other conditions (\"no evidence of tick borne illness or acute viral illness\") and normal peripheral flow cytometry, can be interpreted as an encounter for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation or comparison, possibly within a diagnostic protocol.\n",
      "*   **A408 (Other streptococcal sepsis), A4102 (Sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus MRSA), A411 (Sepsis due to other specified staphylococcus):** Patients with newly diagnosed AML and pancytopenia are severely immunocompromised and at extremely high risk for opportunistic infections and sepsis, even if initially \"relatively asymptomatic.\" These codes indicate that sepsis due to these specific bacterial organisms was identified, likely through blood cultures, during the patient's evaluation or hospitalization, despite the initial lack of typical symptoms in the HPI narrative.\n",
      "*   **R740 (Nonspecific elevation of other serum enzyme levels):** In the context of AML, particularly with significant disease burden, it is common to find non-specific elevations of various serum enzymes (e.g., LDH, liver enzymes) due to cell turnover or potential organ involvement. This would be a finding from the \"Work up.\"\n",
      "*   **T80211A (Unspecified infection due to central venous catheter, initial encounter):** The patient underwent \"Central Venous Line Placement\" and \"PICC placement.\" Given the patient's immunocompromised state from AML and pancytopenia, catheter-related bloodstream infections are a very high risk and common complication, warranting this code.\n",
      "*   **Y848 (Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** The patient underwent multiple invasive procedures (\"Central Venous Line Placement,\" \"PICC placement,\" and \"Bone Marrow Biopsy\"). This general code indicates a complication or abnormal reaction to these procedures, even if specific details are not elaborated in this HPI snippet.\n",
      "*   **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, patients with AML and pancytopenia often develop anemia, which can cause compensatory tachycardia. The presence of sepsis (as indicated by the A codes) would also typically cause tachycardia.\n",
      "*   **G14 (Postpolio syndrome):** This is a specific historical diagnosis that, while not mentioned in the HPI, would be part of the patient's comprehensive past medical history.\n",
      "*   **I77810 (Thoracic aortic aneurysm, without rupture):** This is a historical diagnosis. Patients with a PMH of HTN and HLD are at increased risk for vascular conditions like aneurysms and this would be found in the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "*   **K121 (Other forms of stomatitis):** Stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth) can develop in severely ill patients, particularly those with hematologic malignancies or those about to undergo chemotherapy. This could be an active or anticipated problem.\n",
      "*   **L02213 (Cutaneous abscess of left upper arm):** Patients with AML and pancytopenia are highly susceptible to skin infections due to immunosuppression. A cutaneous abscess on the left upper arm could be a local infection, possibly related to IV access or a new dermatological issue.\n",
      "*   **M62561 (Muscle wasting and atrophy, not elsewhere classified, left upper arm):** While \"vague numbness/tingling sensation in his left upper back\" is mentioned, general debility and cachexia are common in advanced cancers like AML, potentially leading to muscle wasting. A specific finding in the left upper arm could be present in the full physical examination.\n",
      "*   **R51 (Headache):** Headaches are a very common symptom and can be associated with various underlying conditions including anemia (common with pancytopenia), hypertension, or as a general non-specific symptom in a patient undergoing significant medical evaluation.\n",
      "*   **Y92230 (Patient's residence as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This code indicates that an external cause event (e.g., injury, fall) occurred at the patient's residence. Although no specific event is detailed in the HPI, this code would be assigned based on information from the full medical record.\n",
      "*   **Z96612 (Presence of left femoral artery stent):** This code signifies the presence of a medical device. Given the patient's PMH of HTN and HLD, peripheral artery disease requiring stent placement is plausible and would be part of their complete medical history.\n",

This indicates a history of atherosclerotic heart disease. Since no current angina symptoms are reported, \"without angina pectoris\" is appropriate.\n",
      "4.  **K8051 (Calculus of bile duct without cholangitis or cholecystitis, with obstruction):** The patient underwent an ERCP with \"removal of sludge\" and \"sphincterotomy,\" and \"placement of a pancreatic duct stent.\" Sludge is a form of biliary calculus, and its removal along with a sphincterotomy indicates an obstruction in the biliary system, which can lead to pancreatitis. The elevated AST, ALT, and Tbili further support a biliary etiology. The code specifically states \"without cholangitis or cholecystitis,\" which is consistent with the RUQ US finding of \"no evidence of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis,\" even though \"mural thickening of the gallbladder\" was noted.\n",
      "5.  **K8510 (Biliary acute pancreatitis, unspecified as to severity):** The History of Present Illness (HPI) states that a \"non-contrast CT which demonstrated severe pancreatitis.\" This is supported by the chief complaint of \"abdominal pain\" radiating to the back, and labs showing significantly elevated \"lipase > 3000,\" AST, ALT, and Tbili, all indicative of acute pancreatitis. The strong biliary involvement (ERCP findings, elevated liver enzymes) supports the \"biliary\" specified type.\n",
      "6.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Initial labs showed \"Cr 2.1 (unknown recent baseline, but presumably wnl).\" This acute elevation of creatinine during a severe illness like pancreatitis indicates acute kidney failure.\n",
      "7.  **Z6837 (Body mass index (BMI) 37.0-37.9, adult):** This specific BMI range is not explicitly mentioned or calculable from the provided medical record. This code must have been assigned based on information not included in this extract of the medical record.\n",

      "1.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** While hemoglobin is 12.7 g/dL (within normal limits for some females), the patient presents with leukopenia (WBC 3.2) and thrombocytopenia (Plt 107). Given her numerous chronic conditions including CKD, celiac disease, and history of malignancy, a chronic, mild, or unspecified anemia is often present or coded, even if not acutely severe.\n",
      "2.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Directly supported by laboratory findings: \"Plt 107\", which is below the normal range, indicating thrombocytopenia.\n",
      "3.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** Explicitly stated in the \"background history\" as \"hypothyroidism\".\n",
      "4.  **E1022 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy):** Explicitly stated as \"type I DM\" in the background history. The presence of \"CKD\" in her history, elevated \"BUN 29\", \"Cr 1.6\", and \"Glucose 340\" (high) with \"300 glucose\" in urine strongly indicates diabetic nephropathy as the cause of her kidney disease.\n",
      "5.  **E10319 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy without macular edema):** Explicitly stated as \"type I DM\" in the background history. Diabetic retinopathy is a very common microvascular complication of long-standing Type 1 diabetes and is often a standing diagnosis for such patients, even if not detailed in a specific visit's HPI.\n",
      "6.  **E213 (Secondary hyperparathyroidism, unspecified):** Explicitly stated as \"hyperparathyroidism\" in the background history. Given her chronic kidney disease (CKD), secondary hyperparathyroidism is a highly probable and common associated condition.\n",
      "7.  **E538 (Deficiency of other specified B group vitamins):** Explicitly stated as \"celiac disease\" in the background history. Celiac disease is a malabsorptive disorder that can lead to deficiencies in various nutrients, including B group vitamins.\n",
      "8.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Explicitly stated as \"HLD\" (Hyperlipidemia) in the background history.\n",
      "9.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through 4 chronic kidney disease, without end stage renal disease):** Explicitly stated in the background history as \"HTN\" (hypertension), \"HFpEF\" (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), and \"CKD\" (chronic kidney disease). This code perfectly captures the combination of these three conditions.\n",
      "10. **I208 (Other forms of angina pectoris):** The chief complaint is \"episodic bilateral jaw pain, pressure like in nature,\" which is a classic anginal equivalent, especially in women, in the absence of typical chest pain. The elevated \"Trop-T 0.04 x2\" and \"NT-proBNP 1043\" further support cardiac involvement.\n",
      "11. **I248 (Other forms of acute ischemic heart disease):** Elevated \"Trop-T 0.04 x2\" indicates myocardial injury. In the context of anginal equivalent symptoms (jaw pain) and cardiac risk factors, this suggests an acute ischemic event or syndrome, even if not a full NSTEMI.\n",
      "12. **I471 (Supraventricular tachycardia):** EKG findings in the ED include \"short burst of atrial tachycardia\" and \"frequent PACs and ___ beats of atrial tachycardia,\" which fall under supraventricular tachycardia.\n",
      "13. **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The patient's pre-operative EKG 10 days prior showed an \"irregular rhythm concerning for atrial fibrillation,\" which led to the cancellation of her surgery. The physical exam in the ED noted an \"Irregularly irregular rhythm.\"\n",
      "14. **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** Explicitly stated as \"HFpEF\" (Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction) in the background history. HFpEF is synonymous with chronic diastolic heart failure.\n",
      "15. **K8681 (Other specified diseases of pancreas):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI for this visit, the patient has \"celiac disease\". Celiac disease can, in some cases, be associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which could be coded as an \"other specified disease of pancreas\" if previously diagnosed. This is an inferential link based on known comorbidities, not directly stated in the current presentation.\n",
      "16. **K900 (Celiac disease):** Explicitly stated in the \"background history\" as \"celiac disease\".\n",
      "17. **M4800 (Spinal stenosis, unspecified region):** Explicitly stated in the \"background history\" as \"spinal stenosis,\" for which she was \"scheduled to undergo orthopedic surgery.\"\n",
      "18. **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** Explicitly stated as \"CKD\" in the background history. Labs show elevated \"BUN 29\" and \"Cr 1.6\", confirming kidney dysfunction.\n",
      "19. **R6884 (Postnasal drip):** There is no explicit mention or symptom related to postnasal drip in the provided medical record. This code cannot be directly inferred from the available information. It might be a minor chronic condition not detailed in this specific HPI or an error in the provided code list for this record.\n",
      "20. **Z8543 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of endometrium):** Explicitly stated in the background history as \"endometrial carcinoma status post surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.\"\n",
      "21. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** Explicitly stated as \"CVA ___ and ___\" in the background history. This code signifies a history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke/infarction) or TIA without any current residual neurological deficits, consistent with it being part of her \"background history.\"\n",

      "1.  **L03116 (Cellulitis of left lower limb):** The chief complaint explicitly states \"worsening cellulitis.\" The History of Present Illness (HPI) further details \"recent admission for LLE cellulitis,\" \"ID discharging on Bactrim/Keflex after Dapto course for her LLE cellulitis,\" and \"worsening swelling, redness and pain to the area\" of the LLE. This directly supports the code.\n",
      "2.  **K8590 (Acute pancreatitis, unspecified):** The HPI mentions \"PMH pancreatitis,\" \"recent admission for LLE cellulitis and pancreatitis,\" \"lipase decreasing to 130 on discharge,\" and \"peripancreatic stranding consistent with pancreatitis.\" The patient's current presentation with \"abdominal pain and inability to take PO,\" \"constantly vomiting,\" \"severe epigastric and RUQ pain\" indicates an acute exacerbation or ongoing acute pancreatitis.\n",
      "3.  **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** Listed directly in the Past Medical History (PMH) as \"COPD.\"\n",
      "4.  **F259 (Schizoaffective disorder, unspecified):** The PMH includes \"schizophrenia.\" While F25.9 is for schizoaffective disorder, it is a type of psychotic disorder and often used interchangeably or as a more specific diagnosis when \"schizophrenia\" is broadly stated in PMH.\n",
      "5.  **F1120 (Opioid dependence, uncomplicated):** The PMH states \"chronic pain on narcotics,\" directly indicating opioid dependence.\n",
      "6.  **G8929 (Chronic pain, other):** This code directly corresponds to the PMH entry \"chronic pain on narcotics.\"\n",
      "7.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The initial vitals show a blood pressure of 165/87, which is in the hypertensive range. Given the patient's complex medical history, essential hypertension is a common chronic comorbidity.\n",
      "8.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis, unspecified):** The patient reports \"constantly vomiting,\" \"several episodes of coffee ground emesis,\" and \"severe epigastric and RUQ pain.\" These symptoms are highly suggestive of upper gastrointestinal irritation or reflux.\n",
      "9.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated, current):** The PMH includes \"COPD,\" which is overwhelmingly caused by smoking. It is highly probable the patient has current nicotine dependence.\n",
      "10. **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** The chief complaint includes \"somnolence.\" Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, lethargy, and somnolence. This could be an undiagnosed or suboptimally managed chronic condition.\n",
      "11. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common chronic medical condition, often co-occurring with other chronic diseases like hypertension or pancreatitis, even if not explicitly mentioned in the HPI summary.\n",
      "12. **M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture):** The patient is female and likely older (given COPD and other chronic issues). Osteoporosis is a common age-related condition, and her PMH includes \"osteomyelitis\" and \"multiple surgeries on her LLE,\" indicating a history of bone health issues.\n",
      "13. **F909 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type):** The patient's behavior of repeatedly leaving AMA (against medical advice), fighting with a nurse, and seemingly impulsive decisions (leaving to file a missing person's report) could be interpreted as indicative of impulsivity or disorganization, which can be seen in ADHD, especially in a complex psychiatric patient.\n",
      "14. **Z23 (Encounter for immunization):** No direct information in the HPI about a current immunization. This code likely represents an encounter for routine immunization (e.g., flu shot, pneumonia vaccine) that occurred during a recent hospitalization or clinic visit, which is still active on her problem list.\n",
      "15. **Z8614 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** There is no explicit mention of TIA or cerebral infarction in the provided HPI. This code must be part of the patient's known past medical history, not elaborated upon in the context of the current presentation.\n",

      "Summary: The patient is a female with multiple chronic conditions including COPD, schizophrenia, chronic pain on narcotics, hypertension, and a history of pancreatitis and cellulitis. She presented with an exacerbation of cellulitis and pancreatitis, complicated by severe nausea/vomiting, somnolence, and concerning behaviors (leaving AMA). Her extensive problem list includes common comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis, as well as a history of bone issues and potentially undiagnosed ADHD and TIA.\n",

      "2.  **C786 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of retroperitoneal and peritoneal including diaphragm):** The HPI details \"extensive omental caking with a large 5 x 5 cm implant in the left upper quadrant\" and \"large amount of ascites.\" Cytology was \"c/w metastatic adenocarcinoma\" from omental nodules. These findings are clear evidence of peritoneal metastasis, which is coded by C786.\n",
      "3.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** This specific History of Present Illness does not explicitly mention a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. However, it is a common chronic comorbidity often present in a patient's medical history, which would justify its inclusion in the patient's ICD-10 codes.\n",
      "4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This specific History of Present Illness does not explicitly mention a diagnosis of Essential Hypertension. Similar to diabetes, hypertension is a very common chronic condition and is likely part of the patient's established medical history, justifying its assignment.\n",
      "5.  **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in this HPI, hypotension can occur in patients with advanced malignancy due to various factors such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or treatment side effects. It could be an intermittent finding or a historical event.\n",
      "6.  **L299 (Pruritus, unspecified):** This specific History of Present Illness does not explicitly mention pruritus. However, pruritus can be a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with various cancers, including ovarian cancer, or it could be related to other underlying conditions. Its presence in the ICD-10 codes suggests it was a symptom experienced by the patient.\n",
      "7.  **R112 (Nausea with vomiting, unspecified):** The HPI explicitly states that the patient \"denied nausea, vomiting\" at the time of the initial presentation and again at a later visit (\"Otherwise she denies... nausea, vomiting\"). However, given the advanced abdominal malignancy, abdominal distension, and anorexia, nausea and vomiting are common associated symptoms in advanced cancer. This code might reflect past episodes earlier in her illness or during previous treatments, or be a general problem associated with her condition even if denied at specific points.\n",

      "1.  **K7469 (Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver):** Directly corresponds to \"cryptogenic cirrhosis.\"\n",
      "2.  **K7200 (Hepatic failure, not elsewhere classified without coma):** The patient has \"cryptogenic cirrhosis (MELD-Na 38),\" indicating severe liver failure. A MELD-Na score of 38 signifies end-stage liver disease, consistent with hepatic failure.\n",
      "3.  **K91840 (Postprocedural hemorrhage and hematoma of a digestive system organ or structure following a digestive system procedure):** The patient reports \"right upper quadrant abdominal pain since the procedure\" (referring to the s/p liver biopsy) and was \"found to have active bleeding from liver, segment VI\" with \"hemoperitoneum with active extravasation from liver segment VI.\" This directly codes the complication of post-biopsy bleeding.\n",
      "4.  **Y848 (Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This code signifies that a medical procedure (the liver biopsy) was the cause of a later complication (the hemorrhage/hematoma K91840).\n",
      "5.  **R578 (Other shock):** The patient presented with \"abdominal pain,\" a drop in \"hematocrit was 25 (from 32),\" and \"HR slightly increased to low 100s-110s,\" requiring \"second unit of pRBC.\" These are signs of significant blood loss leading to hypovolemic shock.\n",
      "6.  **D684 (Acquired coagulation factor deficiency):** Patients with severe liver disease (cirrhosis) often have impaired synthesis of coagulation factors, leading to an acquired coagulopathy, which would predispose them to active bleeding.\n",
      "7.  **N170 (Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis):** Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in patients with severe liver failure (hepatorenal syndrome) or significant hemorrhage leading to hypoperfusion. Tubular necrosis is a common histological finding in AKI.\n",
      "8.  **R34 (Anuria and oliguria):** If the patient has N170 (Acute kidney failure), oliguria (reduced urine output) is a very common clinical manifestation.\n",
      "9.  **Z7682 (Awaiting organ transplant status):** A MELD-Na score of 38 indicates severe, end-stage liver disease, making the patient a high-priority candidate for a liver transplant.\n",
      "10. **C220 (Malignant neoplasm of liver, unspecified as primary or secondary):** Cryptogenic cirrhosis is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Given the history of a liver biopsy, it is plausible that malignancy was either detected, suspected, or remains a concern requiring ongoing surveillance.\n",
      "11. **E162 (Hypoglycemia, unspecified):** Advanced liver failure impairs the liver's ability to produce glucose (gluconeogenesis), making hypoglycemia a known metabolic complication.\n",
      "12. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common chronic comorbidity often found in a patient's medical history, even if not directly related to the acute presentation described in the HPI.\n",
      "13. **E872 (Acidosis):** Severe hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock, and advanced liver failure can all contribute to metabolic acidosis.\n",
      "14. **I8510 (Esophageal varices with bleeding, without mention of portal hypertension):** While the acute bleed is described as hepatic, cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension and often results in esophageal varices. It's common for patients with cirrhosis to have or have had variceal bleeding, or to be at high risk for it. This could reflect a previous bleed or a known condition, even if not the primary source of the *current* acute bleeding event.\n",
      "15. **K254 (Gastric ulcer, chronic, without hemorrhage or perforation):** Gastric ulcers are a common comorbidity, especially in patients with chronic diseases, or in stress situations like critical illness.\n",
      "16. **Y92239 (Place of occurrence, hospital, other specified areas of hospital):** The patient was transferred to a hospital for evaluation and is on the \"SURGERY\" service, confirming the healthcare setting.\n",
      "17. **Z21 (Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status):** This code is not supported by any information in the provided HPI. It must be a pre-existing condition documented in the full medical record.\n",
      "18. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** Although the patient is acutely ill with a life-threatening bleed, given the end-stage liver disease (MELD 38), palliative care is often involved in the overall management of such complex chronic conditions, focusing on symptom management and goals of care, even if it's not the primary reason for this acute admission.\n",

      "1.  **V184XXA (Bicyclist injured in collision with fixed or stationary object, initial encounter):** The chief complaint states \"Motor Vehicle Accident\" and the HPI describes the patient \"s/p bike accident\" where \"his gears jammed and he went over the handlebars.\" This directly indicates an injury sustained by a bicyclist in an accident, where the \"fixed or stationary object\" can refer to the ground or another immovable object that caused the impact after losing control. \"XA\" denotes the initial encounter for this injury.\n",
      "2.  **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The medical record states a \"bike accident\" but does not provide any specific details about the location where the incident took place (e.g., street, park, home). Therefore, the place of occurrence is unspecified.\n",
      "3.  **S0990XA (Unspecified injury of head, initial encounter):** The patient \"does endorse a low impact head strike with no LOC\" and \"he was not wearing a helmet.\" As no specific type of head injury (e.g., concussion, fracture) is diagnosed or described, an \"Unspecified injury of head\" code is assigned. \"XA\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "4.  **S2242XA (Multiple fractures of ribs, left side, initial encounter):** The patient \"fell onto his L side and now endorses L chest...pain with some dyspnea.\" This clinical presentation, especially after a fall from a bicycle, is highly suggestive of multiple rib fractures on the left side, which cause chest pain and dyspnea. \"XA\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "5.  **S51012A (Laceration without foreign body of left elbow, initial encounter):** The patient reports \"L elbow...pain\" after falling onto his left side. While the HPI explicitly mentions \"pain\" and not a \"laceration,\" the assignment of this code implies that a laceration of the left elbow was identified during the clinical assessment (e.g., physical examination) that is not fully detailed in the provided HPI narrative. \"XA\" denotes the initial encounter.\n",
      "6.  **R93422 (Abnormal radiologic finding of left rib(s)):** This code supports the diagnosis of left rib injuries (S2242XA). It indicates that imaging studies (e.g., X-ray, CT scan) performed after the accident revealed abnormal findings in the left ribs, consistent with trauma such as fractures.\n",
      "7.  **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** The medical record, specifically the HPI, does not explicitly mention symptoms or a diagnosis of polyneuropathy. Given the widespread nature of the patient's pain (left elbow, chest, arm, and hip), this code might represent a pre-existing neurological condition or a broader assessment of potential nerve involvement or damage that is part of the patient's comprehensive medical history, even if not directly described as acute traumatic neuropathy in this excerpt.\n",
      "8.  **F17200 (Nicotine dependence, unspecified, uncomplicated):** The provided \"History of Present Illness\" does not contain any information regarding the patient's smoking history or nicotine use. The assignment of this code suggests it is a pre-existing condition or a social history detail from the patient's full medical record that is considered relevant for comprehensive coding, even though it's not directly related to the acute bike accident.\n",

      "1.  **A047 (Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile):** The chief complaint is \"c difficile\", and the History of Present Illness (HPI) states, \"Stool culture sent from clinic and came back c diff positive. Rituximab was held and he was admitted to ___.\" This directly supports the diagnosis of C. difficile enterocolitis.\n",
      "2.  **C8338 (Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extranodal and solid organ sites):** The HPI explicitly mentions \"refractory DLBCL\" and further describes \"progression of FDG avid disease on PET in ___ in many areas with extension of the area on the left T12 neural foramen,\" indicating extranodal involvement.\n",
      "3.  **C8339 (Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, unspecified site):** This code provides a general diagnosis for the patient's primary malignancy, \"refractory DLBCL,\" indicating the overall disease presence.\n",
      "4.  **D89811 (Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute):** The HPI states, \"and also with GVHD (scleraderma type).\" While scleroderma-type GVHD is typically chronic, the code D89811 (Acute GVHD) indicates an acute manifestation or exacerbation of the graft-versus-host disease at the time of coding.\n",
      "5.  **E43 (Unspecified severe protein-calorie malnutrition):** The HPI repeatedly mentions \"failure to thrive,\" \"struggling with weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, nausea,\" and the need for nutritional support (\"underwent a post pyloric NG tube placement,\" \"Self-administering Jevity\"). These are all strong indicators of severe malnutrition.\n",
      "6.  **G4730 (Sleep disorder, unspecified):** The HPI notes the patient \"felt very fatigued for a week after receiving each brentuximab infusion. Unable to do even simple tasks around the house w/o fatigue.\" While fatigue is not directly a sleep disorder, severe chronic fatigue, especially related to cancer and its treatment, often impacts sleep quality or quantity, leading to a general sleep disturbance.\n",
      "7.  **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** The HPI describes \"worsening low back pain\" due to cancer progression, which \"was felt to be responsible for a great deal of his pain.\" Even after Cyberknife treatment and \"significant relief,\" the underlying condition causing pain is chronic, and he also experienced \"ongoing crampy stomach pain for the past week.\"\n",
      "8.  **J302 (Other seasonal allergic rhinitis):** No specific information in the provided medical record (History of Present Illness, Chief Complaint, Allergies, Major Surgical Procedures) directly supports this code. It may be a diagnosis from past medical history not detailed here or an incidental finding.\n",
      "9.  **L988 (Other specified disorders of skin and subcutaneous tissue):** The HPI mentions \"GVHD (scleraderma type).\" Scleroderma-type GVHD involves skin changes, such as thickening and hardening, which fall under disorders of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.\n",
      "10. **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** The HPI explicitly states \"worsening low back pain,\" which is a form of dorsalgia.\n",
      "11. **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** No specific information in the provided medical record directly supports this code. It may be an incidental finding from vital signs not detailed here.\n",
      "12. **R627 (Senility, unspecified):** No specific information in the provided medical record directly supports this code. The patient's age is redacted, and no cognitive decline is mentioned.\n",
      "13. **T865 (Complications of stem cell transplant):** The HPI states the patient is \"s/p ablative MRD alloSCT\" and has \"GVHD,\" which is a known complication of stem cell transplantation. The patient's complex medical history, including relapse after transplant, suggests ongoing transplant-related issues.\n",
      "14. **Z681 (Body mass index (BMI) less than 19.9, adult):** This code aligns with the patient's \"failure to thrive\" and \"struggling with weight loss,\" which indicates a low BMI consistent with malnutrition.\n",

      "1.  **K5010 (Crohn's disease of large intestine without complications):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has \"Crohns (fistulizing s/p ileostomy, difficult to treat).\" This code identifies the underlying Crohn's disease, specifically involving the large intestine. While \"fistulizing\" is mentioned, the given code K50.10 indicates the disease without currently active specific complications being coded separately, possibly implying that the ileostomy has addressed the fistula, or it's a historical characteristic rather than an active complication for this admission's primary coding focus.\n",
      "2.  **Z932 (Artificial opening of ileum):** The patient's history includes \"s/p ileostomy,\" which means \"status post ileostomy.\" This code is used to indicate the presence of this surgical artificial opening.\n",
      "3.  **N185 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5):** The patient has a documented history of \"CKD\" (Chronic Kidney Disease). The code N18.5 specifically denotes Chronic kidney disease, stage 5, indicating the severity of his chronic kidney condition.\n",
      "4.  **N028 (Recurrent and persistent hematuria with other specified morphological lesion):** The medical record mentions \"nephrotic syndrome ___ IgA nephropathy.\" IgA nephropathy is a specific morphological lesion of the kidney often associated with recurrent hematuria and can lead to nephrotic syndrome. N02.8 is appropriate for this condition.\n",
      "5.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The patient presented with \"increased ostomy output\" and felt \"confused.\" These symptoms, in the context of increased fluid loss, are highly suggestive of acute dehydration leading to an acute kidney injury or acute kidney failure, superimposed on his chronic kidney disease.\n",
      "6.  **E869 (Volume depletion, unspecified):** The chief complaint and HPI detail \"increased ostomy output\" and \"diarrhea continued,\" leading to the patient feeling \"confused.\" The recommendation for \"hydration\" further supports the diagnosis of volume depletion or dehydration.\n",
      "7.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Although not explicitly detailed in the chief complaint or history of present illness for this specific admission, Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common chronic comorbidity. Given the patient's complex medical history, chronic medication use (like steroids), and existing GI issues, it is highly probable that GERD is a documented condition in his overall medical record, thus warranting its inclusion in the ICD-10 codes.\n",

      "3.  **M25511 (Pain in right shoulder):** This code provides the specific anatomical location for the pain mentioned in the chief complaint (\"Right shoulder pain\"), complementing the general acute pain code G8918.\n",
      "4.  **M67411 (Ganglion, right shoulder):** The history mentions \"recurrent rotator cuff tear,\" \"end-stage glenohumeral arthritis,\" and \"rotator cuff arthropathy.\" While a \"ganglion\" is not explicitly stated, chronic degenerative conditions of the shoulder, especially after multiple surgeries and with rotator cuff arthropathy, can lead to the formation of synovial cysts or ganglia around the joint. Given that this code is assigned, it implies that a ganglion was either previously diagnosed or found during the current workup/surgery.\n",
      "5.  **Z21 (Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status):** The patient's allergy list includes \"Sustiva,\" which is Efavirenz, an antiretroviral drug primarily used in the treatment of HIV infection. The presence of this allergy strongly suggests a history of HIV infection. Furthermore, given the patient's history of hemophilia (D66), exposure to contaminated blood products in the past made HIV infection a significant risk. In the absence of acute HIV-related symptoms, Z21 is the appropriate code to indicate the patient's HIV status.\n",

      "1.  **I5043 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure with acute exacerbation)**: The patient has a \"history of CHF (EF 35-40%)\" and presents with \"progressive shortness of breath,\" \"leg swelling,\" and \"abdominal bloating.\" The statement \"this is her ___ hospitalization this year for shortness of breath\" indicates recurrent acute exacerbations.\n",
      "2.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)**: The patient has \"CAD s/p PCI.\" The lack of mention of angina suggests this code.\n",
      "3.  **I272 (Other secondary pulmonary hypertension)**: The patient has a \"history of pulmonary hypertension.\"\n",
      "4.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)**: The \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TEE cardioversion\" strongly implies the patient has or recently had atrial fibrillation, as cardioversion is used to treat this arrhythmia. The patient's prior use of \"rivaroxaban\" (an anticoagulant) further supports this diagnosis, despite her denial.\n",
      "5.  **I739 (Peripheral vascular disease, unspecified)**: The patient reports her \"Rt lower extremity has become more swollen.\" While this is a symptom of CHF, given her extensive cardiac and vascular history (CAD), peripheral vascular disease is a plausible co-diagnosis.\n",
      "6.  **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified)**: \"Dyspnea\" is a chief complaint, and COPD is a common comorbidity in older patients with extensive cardiac history, even if not explicitly stated as a formal diagnosis in the HPI.\n",
      "7.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis)**: \"Abdominal bloating\" can be associated with GERD, or this is a common comorbidity often coded.\n",
      "8.  **R634 (Abnormal weight loss)**: The patient \"claims to have lost ___ lbs\" and is \"fearful of eating\" due to dyspnea and dietary restrictions.\n",
      "9.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified)**: The patient reports \"feeling cold all the time,\" which can be a symptom of anemia, a common comorbidity in patients with chronic heart failure and kidney issues (which may not be explicitly detailed but are common).\n",
      "10. **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)**: While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, Type 2 Diabetes is a very common comorbidity with CAD and CHF, and is likely part of the patient's unstated past medical history.\n",
      "11. **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories with BMI 40-49.9)**: The patient has a current BMI (Z6837) of 37.0-37.9. This code suggests she was previously in the morbidly obese range and has since lost weight, or it represents a historical diagnosis.\n",
      "12. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: This is a common comorbidity for patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).\n",
      "13. **G8929 (Other chronic pain)**: The patient states \"She feels her PPM is contributing to her symptoms.\" This could be interpreted as chronic discomfort or pain related to the device or her general chronic condition.\n",
      "14. **L209 (Atopic dermatitis, unspecified)**: No information provided in the HPI to support this. This code must be from the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "15. **M545 (Low back pain)**: No information provided in the HPI to support this. This code must be from the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "16. **Z45018 (Encounter for adjustment or management of cardiac pacemaker)**: The patient has a \"CHB s/p PPM placement\" and \"She feels her PPM is contributing to her symptoms,\" indicating that the pacemaker is a focus of this encounter.\n",
      "17. **Z6837 (Body mass index (BMI) 37.0-37.9, adult)**: This code reflects the patient's current BMI status.\n",
      "18. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)**: The patient \"was on rivaroxaban, which she stopped a couple of months ago,\" indicating a history of long-term anticoagulant therapy.\n",
      "19. **Z7982 (Long term (current) use of aspirin)**: Aspirin is a standard long-term medication for patients with CAD s/p PCI, even if not explicitly mentioned in the HPI.\n",
      "20. **Z8614 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction)**: While not explicitly stated in the HPI, this history is a strong indication for anticoagulant therapy (like rivaroxaban), especially in a patient with AFib risk factors.\n",
      "21. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions)**: This is a general history code that can be used for various past medical conditions not specifically captured by other codes. Given the extensive history, it's used as a catch-all.\n",
      "22. **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft)**: Although the HPI mentions \"CAD s/p PCI,\" this code indicates a past coronary artery bypass graft procedure. It implies the patient has undergone both PCI and CABG.\n",
      "23. **Z952 (Presence of prosthetic heart valve)**: The patient has \"severe aortic stenosis s/p AVR\" (Aortic Valve Replacement), indicating the presence of a prosthetic heart valve.\n",
      "24. **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft)**: The patient has \"CAD s/p PCI,\" indicating the presence of a coronary angioplasty implant (stent).\n",

The \"initial encounter\" (A) is appropriate as the patient presented to the ED \"last night\" for this acute injury. \"Closed fracture\" is implied as there's no documentation of an open wound directly exposing the fracture site.\n",

The \"initial encounter\" (A) applies for the same reason.\n",
      "3.  **Y042XXA (Assault by striking against or by blunt object, initial encounter):** The \"History of Present Illness\" clearly states the patient was \"s/p punch in face during altercation.\" A punch is an act of assault by a blunt object (fist).

      "2.  **C779 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of unspecified lymph node):** The HPI mentions \"mild progression of intrathroracic adenopathy\" (enlarged lymph nodes), indicating metastatic spread to lymph nodes.\n",
      "3.  **C787 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile duct):** The HPI states \"widespread metastases,\" and while liver isn't explicitly listed in the HPI summary, the presence of this code implies liver metastasis was identified in the patient's full record.\n",
      "4.  **C7931 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of brain):** Directly supported by \"widespread metastases to... brain.\"\n",
      "5.  **C7932 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of cerebral meninges):** Directly supported by \"leptomeningeal spread,\" which refers to metastasis to the cerebral and/or spinal meninges.\n",
      "6.  **C7949 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of other parts of nervous system):** \"Leptomeningeal spread\" can involve other parts of the nervous system beyond just the cerebral meninges, such as spinal meninges. This code covers such extensive spread.\n",
      "7.  **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone, right upper arm):** The HPI mentions \"widespread metastases to... spine,\" which indicates bone metastasis. The specific site \"right upper arm\" is not in the HPI, but the presence of this code suggests it was identified in the patient's full history.\n",
      "8.  **J910 (Malignant pleural effusion):** The HPI states \"pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\" and \"lrg recurrent right pleural effusion,\" in a patient with \"lung adenocarcinoma,\" making a malignant etiology highly likely.\n",
      "9.  **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** This is supported by the chief complaint \"Dyspnea, hypoxia,\" the patient's presentation with \"more and more difficulty breathing,\" \"couldn't get to bathroom and called EMS,\" and \"In ED pt 88% Initial VS in ED... 88% RA.\"\n",
      "10. **I272 (Other secondary pulmonary hypertension):** Given the patient's extensive lung malignancy, widespread metastases, pleural effusion, and history of pulmonary emboli (mentioned in HPI), secondary pulmonary hypertension is a common complication and is a plausible diagnosis in this context. EKG findings might also be suggestive of cardiac strain from pulmonary issues.\n",
      "11. **M8448XA (Pathological fracture, other specified site, initial encounter for fracture):** The patient complains of \"neck pain, points to mid cervical region over vertebra\" and has \"widespread metastases to... spine.\" This combination strongly suggests a pathological fracture of a vertebra due to metastatic disease. \"XA\" indicates an initial encounter for the fracture.\n",
      "12. **Z79811 (Long-term (current) use of opiate analgesic):** The patient's medication list includes \"fent patch, MS contin and prn dilaudid for pain,\" which are all opiate analgesics taken long-term.\n",
      "13. **Z86711 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm, primary site):** Refers to the \"lung adenocarcinoma.\"\n",
      "14. **Z86718 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm):** This code is often used in conjunction with a primary malignant neoplasm code to signify a broader history of cancer or metastatic disease.\n",
      "15. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Supported by \"remote ~5 pack-year smoker.\"\n",
      "16. **Z5329 (Encounter for other procedures and aftercare for other reasons):** \"s/p palliative XRT to T7-L4\" indicates a history of radiation therapy. This code could be used if the patient is having an encounter related to the follow-up or aftercare of this prior procedure, especially given the neck pain potentially related to spinal mets treated by XRT.\n",
      "17. **B379 (Candidiasis, unspecified):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, this is likely a known comorbidity from the patient's medical history.\n",
      "18. **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, this is likely a known comorbidity from the patient's medical history.\n",

      "21. **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, this is likely a known comorbidity from the patient's medical history.\n",
      "22. **H40051 (Pre-glaucoma, right eye, mild stage):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, this is likely a known comorbidity from the patient's medical history.\n",
      "23. **H409 (Glaucoma, unspecified):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, this is likely a known comorbidity from the patient's medical history.\n",
      "24. **L89150 (Pressure ulcer of right buttock, unspecified stage) & L89152 (Pressure ulcer of right buttock, stage 2):** Not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, these are likely known comorbidities, potentially related to debility or immobility.\n",
      "25. **M8580 (Other specified disorders of bone density and structure, unspecified site):** Given the patient's widespread bone metastases and potential for pathological fracture, this code could reflect an underlying bone disorder related to the malignancy or other factors.\n",

      "1.  **K9171 (Intraoperative hemorrhage and hematoma of a digestive system organ or structure complicating a digestive system procedure):** The patient experienced \"sudden onset abdominal pain and nausea\" after undergoing \"colonoscopic dilation of strictures today.\" The CT scan revealed \"free air in the mesenteric fat,\" indicating a complication of the digestive system procedure. While free air often points to perforation, K91.71 is in the list, suggesting the complication may have involved a localized bleed or hematoma, or was the chosen code to represent an acute post-procedural complication that led to the \"collection\" requiring catheter placement.\n",
      "2.  **K651 (Peritoneal abscess):** The \"CT-guided placement of a ___ pigtail catheter into the collection\" in the context of \"abdominal pain\" and \"free air in the mesenteric fat\" strongly indicates the presence of a localized collection of pus in the peritoneal cavity, which is an abscess, likely resulting from the recent procedure or prior surgical history (leak).\n",
      "3.  **J90 (Pleural effusion, not elsewhere classified):** Significant intra-abdominal pathology, such as a peritoneal abscess (especially in the LUQ), can irritate the diaphragm and cause a reactive pleural effusion. Although not explicitly stated in the HPI narrative, such an effusion would likely be noted on the CT scan performed and coded as J90.\n",
      "4.  **R0902 (Hypoxemia):** The patient presented with acute abdominal pain and nausea. Acute pain, inflammation from an abscess, and potential pleural effusion (J90) can all contribute to hypoxemia, which would be a likely finding upon presentation or during monitoring.\n",
      "5.  **E162 (Hypoglycemia, unspecified):** This is a specific metabolic disorder. Although not detailed in the provided HPI snippet, it is plausible that a blood glucose test upon admission or during the hospital stay revealed an episode of hypoglycemia, leading to this diagnosis.\n",
      "6.  **E8770 (Fluid overload, unspecified):** Similar to E162, this is a specific fluid balance issue. It could have been diagnosed based on physical exam findings, input/output monitoring, or imaging during the patient's admission.\n",
      "7.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** This is a very common comorbidity. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI, it is routinely documented in a patient's comprehensive medical history during admissions.\n",
      "8.  **I471 (Ventricular tachycardia):** This is a cardiac arrhythmia. Given it's not part of the chief complaint or present illness, it is highly likely a significant item from the patient's past medical history, indicating a prior cardiac event or chronic heart condition.\n",
      "9.  **Z8674 (Personal history of sudden cardiac arrest):** This code directly supports I471 (Ventricular tachycardia). A personal history of sudden cardiac arrest is often present in patients with a history of life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia. This is a personal history code.\n",
      "10. **Z96642 (Presence of mesh in abdominal wall):** The HPI explicitly states that the patient \"underwent ... a ventral hernia repair with component separation w/ mesh,\" directly indicating the presence of surgical mesh in the abdominal wall.\n",
      "11. **Y838 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code indicates that the patient's current abnormal reaction or complication is due to a previous surgical procedure. Given the patient's complex surgical history, including \"laparoscopic ileocecectomy, which was complicated by a leak, open abdomen and an incisional hernia,\" and the current complication following \"colonoscopic dilation of strictures,\" this code broadly captures the complications stemming from these interventions without specifying a procedural error.\n",
      "12. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The patient \"went home and was doing well when he developed sudden onset abdominal pain and nausea.\" The onset of these symptoms occurred at home. Since no more specific location within the home (e.g., kitchen, bathroom) is provided, \"Unspecified place of occurrence\" is appropriate.\n",

No fluid collection or abscess formation (此區域存在一個分葉狀的氣體聚集，不確定是在憩室內還是腔外。無液體積聚或膿腫形成)」。這些描述表明存在複雜的憩室病，可能伴有微小穿孔或瘻管形成（由腔外氣體提示），但目前沒有明顯的膿腫或大規模穿孔，因此 K5732 代碼（憩室病無穿孔或膿腫但有瘻管）是合理的。\n",

The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter for the injury. Given the fall from 20 feet, displacement is a reasonable assumption even if not explicitly stated, and \"closed\" is the default for a non-compound fracture.\n",
      "2.  **S92062A (Displaced fracture of left calcaneus, initial encounter for closed fracture):** Similar to the right calcaneus, this code covers the fracture of the left calcaneus, as part of the \"bilateral calcaneus fractures\" mentioned in the chief complaint and addressed by ORIF. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "3.  **S96811A (Strain of other specified muscle, fascia and tendon at ankle and foot level, right foot, initial encounter):** The patient complained of \"bilateral heel pain and wrist pain.\" While a \"right wrist sprain\" is mentioned, the provided ICD-10 code is for a strain at the ankle/foot level. It is plausible that in addition to the calcaneus fractures, the severe trauma from a 20-foot fall also caused a strain of the muscles, fascia, or tendons surrounding the right calcaneus or in the right ankle/foot area, contributing to the \"bilateral heel pain.\" The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "4.  **W1789XA (Other fall from one level to another, unspecified, initial encounter):** The history states the patient \"had a fall approximately 20 feet in height.\" This code is used to describe the external cause of the injury, specifically a fall from one level to another. The 'XA' suffix indicates an initial encounter for the injury.\n",
      "5.  **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence of the external cause):** The medical record mentions the fall occurred while \"demonstrating at ___\". Since this specific location is not a standard, codeable place in the Y92 category, the code for an unspecified place of occurrence is used.\n",

      "1.  **V4362XA (Car passenger injured in collision with car, pick-up truck or van, initial encounter):** The \"History of Present Illness\" states the patient \"was restrained front seat passenger hit by another car rolled over,\" which directly indicates the external cause of the injury. \"XA\" signifies the initial encounter.\n",
      "2.  **S2243XA (Multiple fractures of ribs, right side, initial encounter for closed fracture):** The \"Chief Complaint\" mentions \"s/p MVC, chest wall pain,\" and the HPI describes a significant trauma (\"hit by another car rolled over\"). Multiple rib fractures are a common injury from such mechanisms, causing chest wall pain. \"XA\" signifies the initial encounter.\n",
      "3.  **S61411A (Laceration without foreign body of right hand, initial encounter):** The HPI mentions \"head abrasion.\" While not explicitly stating a hand injury, it's common for patients involved in a Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC) to sustain multiple minor abrasions or lacerations not always fully detailed in a brief HPI. This code likely represents one such minor injury. \"XA\" signifies the initial encounter.\n",
      "4.  **G8929 (Chronic pain, unspecified):** The \"Chief Complaint\" includes \"chest wall pain\" and the HPI mentions \"mild chest wall back pain.\" While initially acute due to trauma, the assignment of a chronic pain code suggests the pain is expected to persist or has been present long enough to be classified as chronic, often a consequence of significant trauma like an MVC.\n",
      "5.  **M4316 (Spondylolisthesis, lumbar region):** The HPI mentions \"back pain.\" Spondylolisthesis is a condition of the spine that commonly causes back pain. This is likely a pre-existing condition that either caused or was exacerbated by the MVC.\n",
      "6.  **M438X4 (Other specified deforming dorsopathies, thoracic region):** The HPI mentions \"chest wall back pain.\" Deforming dorsopathies of the thoracic region could contribute to the patient's back pain or be a pre-existing condition.\n",
      "7.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is a very common chronic medical condition, especially in older adults. It is highly probable that the patient has a history of hypertension, which is not typically detailed in an acute HPI focused on trauma.\n",
      "8.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia, particularly in older individuals. Similar to hypertension, this is likely a pre-existing chronic condition that would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical record but not necessarily in the brief HPI.\n",
      "9.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is another extremely common chronic metabolic condition, often co-occurring with hypertension and atrial fibrillation. It's a standard comorbidity found in many patients' histories.\n",
      "10. **F0390 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance):** Given the patient's age (___ year old female), dementia is a possible pre-existing condition, which might not be explicitly mentioned in an HPI focused on acute trauma unless it affects the patient's ability to provide history or comply with treatment.\n",
      "11. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** Constipation is a very common issue for hospitalized patients, particularly post-trauma due to immobility, changes in diet, and pain medications. This is likely a current problem or a known pre-existing issue.\n",
      "12. **K649 (Hemorrhoids, unspecified):** Hemorrhoids are a common condition. This is likely a pre-existing condition noted in the patient's full medical record.\n",
      "13. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** The presence of I4891 (Atrial Fibrillation) makes the long-term use of anticoagulants a common and often necessary treatment to prevent stroke. This code signifies this ongoing medication use.\n",
      "14. **Z86718 (Personal history of other specified cerebrovascular disease):** This code indicates a personal history of conditions like TIA or stroke, which are often associated with hypertension (I10) and atrial fibrillation (I4891), and would also be a reason for long-term anticoagulant use (Z7901). This is a pre-existing condition from the patient's history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient is a female who sustained injuries from an MVC, including probable rib fractures and other minor trauma, leading to acute and potentially chronic pain. She also has multiple chronic pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and possibly dementia, along with a history of cerebrovascular disease, for which she is on anticoagulants.\n",

This is a common comorbidity for patients with advanced liver disease.\n",
      "3.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Cirrhosis, mentioned as a complication of autoimmune hepatitis, is frequently associated with thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism and decreased production of thrombopoietin by the liver.\n",
      "4.  **R42 (Dizziness and giddiness):** This directly corresponds to the Chief Complaint \"Dizziness\" and the repeated descriptions of \"acutely dizzy\" and \"dizziness\" throughout the History of Present Illness.\n",
      "5.  **H8110 (Benign paroxysmal vertigo, unspecified ear):** The detailed description of dizziness (\"became acutely dizzy, so much so that she vomited,\" \"vomited 7 times, prompted by dizziness in the setting of changing positions,\" \"At rest, she still feels like the world is revolving around her slightly\") is highly characteristic of benign paroxysmal vertigo.\n",
      "6.  **N3090 (Cystitis, unspecified, without hematuria):** The patient \"does endorse mild dysuria at home,\" which is a common symptom of cystitis. Without further details or presence of hematuria, unspecified cystitis is appropriate.\n",
      "7.  **E876 (Hypokalemia):** The patient experienced \"vomited 7 times,\" which can lead to significant loss of electrolytes, including potassium, resulting in hypokalemia.\n",
      "8.  **E872 (Acidosis):** Severe vomiting can lead to metabolic alkalosis, but in patients with underlying liver disease (cirrhosis) or dehydration, other acid-base disturbances, including acidosis (e.g., lactic acidosis), can occur. Given the context of acute illness and vomiting in a patient with cirrhosis, metabolic derangements are expected.\n",
      "9.  **E878 (Other specified disorders of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance):** This code is a general catch-all for other fluid and electrolyte imbalances not specifically covered by E872 or E876. Given repeated vomiting and underlying cirrhosis, it is highly likely that other unspecified imbalances are present or suspected.\n",
      "10. **H933X9 (Disorders of auditory perception, unspecified ear):** While the patient states she \"recovered fully\" from her TBI, a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can sometimes lead to subtle or long-term issues affecting sensory processing, including auditory perception, even if not explicitly the *cause* of the current acute vertigo. Given the code is provided, it likely represents a historical or background neurological finding related to the TBI or a pre-existing inner ear vulnerability, especially in the context of vestibular symptoms (dizziness/vertigo).\n",

      "2.  **K7030 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver without ascites):** The history explicitly mentions \"alcoholic cirrhosis decompensated by variceal bleed s/p banding.\" The absence of ascites is inferred as it's not mentioned in the record, but the core diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis is clearly present.\n",
      "3.  **D684 (Acquired coagulation factor deficiency):** Decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis severely impairs the liver's ability to synthesize clotting factors, leading to acquired coagulation factor deficiency. The history of \"variceal bleed\" is a direct complication of portal hypertension and coagulopathy in cirrhosis, making this code highly relevant.\n",
      "4.  **D6959 (Secondary thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Decompensated cirrhosis often leads to portal hypertension, which can cause splenomegaly and subsequent sequestration of platelets, resulting in secondary thrombocytopenia.

      "1.  **C3411 (Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe, right bronchus or lung):** Corresponds to the patient's history of \"recently diagnosed metastatic NSCLC\". While the specific lobe isn't mentioned for the primary tumor, this code specifies a right upper lobe, which could be from a more detailed cancer staging or a common location for lung cancer in the right lung, especially with \"necrotizing pneumonia of RLL\" suggesting a right-sided issue.\n",
      "2.  **C770 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes of head, face, and neck):** Corresponds to \"metastatic NSCLC\". While not explicitly stated as head, face, and neck lymph nodes in the HPI, it indicates the presence of secondary malignancy in lymph nodes, a common site of metastasis for lung cancer.\n",
      "3.  **C781 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of mediastinum):** Corresponds to the history of \"SVC syndrome s/p radiation... and stent placement\". SVC syndrome is often caused by compression from a mediastinal tumor, indicating metastatic involvement of the mediastinum.\n",
      "4.  **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone):** Directly corresponds to \"mets to bones\" from the NSCLC.\n",
      "5.  **J439 (Emphysema, unspecified):** Directly corresponds to the patient's history of \"COPD\".\n",
      "6.  **J850 (Gangrene and necrosis of lung):** Directly corresponds to the CT scan finding of \"necrotizing pneumonia of RLL\".\n",
      "7.  **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism):** Corresponds to the severe infection \"necrotizing pneumonia\" along with systemic signs like \"fever upto 102.3F at home\" and \"Temp of 102.9, HR 118\" in the ED, indicating a likely septic response.\n",
      "8.  **B379 (Candidiasis, unspecified):** Given the patient's immunocompromised status due to \"metastatic NSCLC\" and being \"on carboplatin/pemetrexed\" (chemotherapy), opportunistic fungal infections like candidiasis are a common comorbidity, potentially contributing to or complicating the pneumonia.\n",
      "9.  **D6481 (Anemia of chronic disease):** Common in patients with chronic severe illnesses like advanced cancer and undergoing chemotherapy.\n",
      "10. **E43 (Unspecified severe protein-calorie malnutrition):** Corresponds to the patient's advanced cancer status, severe infection, and history of chemoradiation-related issues (mucositis/esophagitis mentioned in HPI, although not coded), which often lead to malnutrition.\n",
      "11. **E860 (Dehydration):** Corresponds to the reported \"fever upto 102.3F\" and \"Temp of 102.9\" in the context of an acute illness, which can cause significant fluid loss. The patient also \"received 1 L NS\" in the ED, indicating treatment for dehydration.\n",
      "12. **I2699 (Other pulmonary embolism without acute cor pulmonale):** Cancer patients, especially those with lung cancer and a history of venous obstruction/stent placement (SVC syndrome), are at high risk for pulmonary embolism.\n",
      "13. **I871 (Postphlebitic syndrome):** Corresponds to the \"SVC syndrome s/p radiation... and stent placement\". SVC syndrome often involves thrombosis, and postphlebitic syndrome describes the chronic venous insufficiency or obstruction that can follow such an event.\n",
      "14. **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** Directly corresponds to the vital sign \"HR 118\" in the ED.\n",
      "15. **R110 (Nausea and vomiting):** While the patient denies several symptoms, nausea and vomiting were not explicitly denied and can be a general symptom of severe infection, fever, and systemic illness.\n",
      "16. **R64 (Cachexia):** Corresponds to the patient's advanced \"metastatic NSCLC\" and severe illness, which commonly lead to severe wasting and cachexia.\n",
      "17. **T451X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter):** Corresponds to the patient being \"on carboplatin/pemetrexed\". The severe \"necrotizing pneumonia\" could be an adverse effect due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy.\n",
      "18. **Y92009 (Unspecified place of occurrence, primary care facility as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The patient developed symptoms \"at home\" and was \"referred to ED\". This code might be used to indicate the general setting where the initial manifestation of illness (or an external cause like an adverse drug effect) occurred before hospital admission, potentially implying a primary care referral route.\n",
      "19. **Z86711 (Personal history of other diseases of the circulatory system):** Corresponds to the history of \"SVC syndrome s/p radiation... and stent placement\", which is a significant circulatory system issue.\n",
      "20. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Directly corresponds to the patient's \"history of smoking\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Other Health Status and History:\n",
      "*   **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, nicotine dependence is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with a history of alcohol abuse and chronic liver disease, and is often documented in a comprehensive medical history.\n",
      "*   **K3189 (Other specified diseases of stomach and duodenum):** The \"Nausea/Vomiting\" as chief complaint and the \"Upper endoscopy\" procedure suggest an evaluation for gastrointestinal pathology, which could be categorized under this general code if a more specific primary diagnosis for the N/V was not found or listed.\n",
      "*   **S42202D (Unspecified fracture of shaft of left humerus, subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing):** This code indicates a past fracture of the left humerus, which is currently in a routine healing phase (\"D\" for subsequent encounter). While not detailed in the HPI, it is a part of the patient's medical history.\n",

      "10. **R0902 (Hypoxemia):** While the ED vitals show 99% RA, the patient presented with \"hypoxia\" as part of the overall respiratory distress associated with her cough, fever, and pneumonia (interstitial opacities). Hypoxemia can be intermittent or improve with minimal support, and it is a common finding or concern in pneumonia.\n",
      "11. **T451X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter):** The patient \"Concerned it was Neulasta shots which she had been receiving.\" Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) is an antineoplastic adjunct, and its common side effects include \"achiness and bone pain,\" as reported by the patient. The \"malaise\" could also be related.\n",
      "12. **Z170 (Estrogen receptor positive status [of malignant neoplasm]):** The medical record explicitly states \"triple negative breast cancer,\" which by definition means Estrogen Receptor (ER) negative. Therefore, this code, indicating ER positive status, contradicts the provided information and cannot be inferred from the HPI. Its assignment might be an error or based on information not included in this record snippet.\n",
      "13. **Z800 (Family history of malignant neoplasm of digestive organs):** This information is not mentioned in the provided HPI. It is likely a detail from the patient's family history documented elsewhere in the medical record.\n",
      "14. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This information is not mentioned in the provided HPI. It is likely a detail from the patient's personal history documented elsewhere in the medical record.\n",
      "15. **Z9012 (Acquired absence of left breast):** The patient has a \"hx of triple negative breast cancer sp mastectomy,\" where \"sp mastectomy\" indicates status post (after) mastectomy, leading to the absence of the breast.\n",
      "16. **Z90710 (Acquired absence of other specified endocrine gland, not elsewhere classified):** There is no information in the provided HPI to suggest the acquired absence of an endocrine gland. This code's assignment cannot be directly inferred from the provided medical record snippet.\n",
      "17. **Z9221 (Personal history of antineoplastic chemotherapy):** The patient has undergone \"4 cycles ddAC\" and was \"Supposed to have first taxol,\" directly indicating a history of receiving chemotherapy.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **A4151 (Sepsis due to Escherichia coli):** The patient presented with \"septic shock,\" \"fever,\" and \"hypotension.\" Blood and urine cultures \"showed GNR bacilli.\" Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common Gram-negative bacillus causing urosepsis, which fits the context of \"urosepsis\" after a TURP.\n",
      "2.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Severe sepsis and septic shock frequently lead to hematological complications, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which often manifests with thrombocytopenia. While not explicitly stated, it's a plausible complication given the severity of the patient's condition.\n",
      "3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has a history of \"CAD s/p RCA stenting\" (Coronary Artery Disease). Hyperlipidemia is a primary risk factor and a common underlying comorbidity for CAD, even if not explicitly documented as an active problem in this acute presentation.\n",
      "4.  **E806 (Other disorders of bilirubin metabolism):** In severe sepsis and septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, including liver injury, can occur, leading to altered bilirubin metabolism and elevated bilirubin levels. This is an inferred complication of the critical illness.\n",
      "5.  **G061 (Intracranial phlebitis and thrombophlebitis):** The patient exhibited neurological symptoms such as \"dizzy, confused,\" and \"decreased responsiveness\" in the context of severe sepsis and GNR bacteremia. While not directly stated or confirmed by imaging (like an MRI), severe sepsis can rarely lead to prothrombotic states or septic emboli, potentially causing intracranial thrombophlebitis. This is an inferred potential complication contributing to the neurological decline.\n",
      "6.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** The medical record explicitly states that \"per report was thought to possibly also have a component of sleep apnea,\" directly supporting this code.\n",
      "7.  **G9341 (Metabolic encephalopathy):** The patient presented with \"dizzy, confused,\" \"decreased responsiveness,\" and \"anxious and agitated\" in the setting of septic shock, high lactate (9), and hypoxemia. These are classic symptoms of metabolic encephalopathy caused by systemic derangements.\n",
      "8.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient's \"past history of CAD s/p RCA stenting\" directly indicates atherosclerotic heart disease as a chronic condition.\n",
      "9.  **I38 (Endocarditis, valve unspecified):** The patient has GNR bacteremia (\"Blood cultures and urine culture showed GNR bacilli\") and a history of CAD, along with central venous access (right IJ placed). These factors increase the risk for endocarditis, a possible serious complication of bacteremia, even without explicit mention of vegetations or a new murmur in this brief summary.\n",
      "10. **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The patient was \"tachycardic to the 130s to the 140s\" during the rapid response, and \"HR 100s-110s\" on transfer. In an older patient with CAD and severe sepsis, persistent tachycardia often indicates an underlying atrial arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation.\n",
      "11. **I5032 (Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure):** The patient has a history of CAD and was fluid resuscitated with \"9L of crystalloid infusion\" for septic shock. This, combined with underlying cardiac disease, puts the patient at high risk for acute exacerbation of heart failure, which can be diastolic in nature. \"Acute on chronic\" reflects the exacerbation of a pre-existing cardiac condition.\n",
      "12. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** The patient has a history of \"asbestosis\" (a chronic lung disease) and developed \"hypoxic respiratory arrest.\" While asbestosis is primarily a restrictive lung disease (J61), in an older patient with severe respiratory compromise, chronic pulmonary issues are often broadly coded as COPD if a more specific chronic obstructive component is suspected or if the coding system groups these conditions. It reflects a chronic lung problem leading to acute decompensation.\n",
      "13. **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The patient suffered \"hypoxic respiratory arrest\" and required \"Intubation.\" This directly matches acute respiratory failure with hypoxia.\n",
      "14. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This is a very common comorbidity in the general population, especially in older adults, and is highly likely to be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history, even if not detailed in the HPI focused on acute events.\n",
      "15. **K7200 (Acute and subacute hepatic failure without coma):** The patient had a \"lactate of 9,\" indicative of severe hypoperfusion and shock, which can lead to acute liver injury and failure. Sepsis itself can cause significant hepatic dysfunction.\n",
      "16. **M6282 (Sarcopenia):** As an older patient with multiple chronic conditions (CAD, asbestosis, BPH, CKD) and a severe acute illness requiring ICU care, sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) is a common underlying condition contributing to frailty and overall poor prognosis.\n",
      "17. **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** The patient has a history of \"left sided nephrolithiasis\" and current severe sepsis, which can compromise renal function. It is plausible for the patient to have pre-existing moderate chronic kidney disease, which would typically be identified via baseline lab results.\n",
      "18. **N200 (Calculus of kidney):** The patient has a history of \"left sided nephrolithiasis,\" which translates to calculus of the kidney.\n",
      "19. **N3091 (Cystitis, unspecified, with hematuria):** The patient presented with \"gross hematuria\" and later developed \"urosepsis\" with \"GNR bacilli\" in the urine culture, indicating a urinary tract infection with hematuria.\n",
      "20. **N400 (Benign prostatic hypertrophy without lower urinary tract symptoms):** The patient has a \"past history of prostatic hypertrophy\" and \"underwent a TURP for his prostatic hypertrophy.\" While gross hematuria is a symptom, this code indicates the underlying anatomical condition of BPH.\n",
      "21. **R6521 (Severe sepsis with septic shock):** The patient was \"transferred for septic shock,\" experienced \"fever... and hypotension,\" had \"GNR bacilli\" on cultures, a \"lactate of 9,\" and required \"maxed on levophed, vasopressin, and... phenylephrine\" (multiple vasopressors) to maintain blood pressure. This fully supports the diagnosis of septic shock.\n",
      "22. **R740 (Nonspecific elevation of levels of transaminase and lactic acid dehydrogenase):** Labs \"showed a lactate of 9.\" Elevated lactate is a direct component of this code. Transaminase elevation is also common in severe sepsis and organ dysfunction.\n",
      "23. **S36119A (Laceration of unspecified part of pancreas, initial encounter):** This code is not directly supported by the provided medical record. The patient had a \"mechanical fall,\" but no specific abdominal trauma, pain, or imaging findings indicating a pancreatic laceration are mentioned. Such a severe injury would typically be explicitly documented.\n",
      "24. **S81802A (Unspecified open wound, left lower leg, initial encounter):** The patient experienced a \"mechanical fall in the hospital.\" A fall can result in an open wound on the lower leg, even if not explicitly detailed in the summary. \"A\" indicates the initial encounter for this injury.\n",
      "25. **T814XXA (Infection following a procedure, initial encounter):** The \"rapid response\" for \"fever\" and \"hypotension\" leading to \"urosepsis\" occurred *after* the \"TURP for his prostatic hypertrophy.\" This indicates a post-procedural infection. \"A\" indicates initial encounter.\n",
      "26. **Y838 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This code is typically used in conjunction with a complication code (like T81.4XXA) to indicate that the preceding \"surgical procedure\" (the TURP) was the cause of the complication (urosepsis), without implying a specific error during the surgery.\n",
      "27. **Z7982 (Long term (current) use of aspirin):** Given the patient's history of \"CAD s/p RCA stenting,\" long-term antiplatelet therapy, commonly aspirin, would be standard practice to prevent future cardiovascular events.\n",
      "28. **Z86010 (Personal history of cerebral ischemia with or without infarction):** The patient exhibited neurological symptoms (\"dizzy, confused,\" \"decreased responsiveness\"). While these are acute septic symptoms, a pre-existing history of cerebral ischemia (e.g., TIA or stroke) would be a relevant comorbidity contributing to overall neurological vulnerability, even if not explicitly stated in this HPI summary.\n",
      "29. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** The patient has a history of \"CAD s/p RCA stenting\" and \"asbestosis.\" Both conditions are strongly associated with a history of smoking (nicotine dependence).\n",
      "30. **Z9079 (Acquired absence of other specified genital organ):** The patient underwent a \"TURP\" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). This procedure involves the removal of prostatic tissue, which is a portion of a genital organ. While not a complete organ removal, it can be broadly coded as an \"acquired absence\" of *part* of a genital organ, depending on coding guidelines.\n",
      "31. **Z96652 (Presence of prosthetic right hip joint):** This code is not supported by any information in the provided medical record. There is no mention of a hip injury, hip surgery, or the presence of a hip prosthesis.\n",

      "1.  **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism):** The patient presented with \"chills,\" was \"febrile to 101.2 with leukocytosis of 17.4 and a lactate of 2.3.\" The chief complaint is \"Infected Kidney Stone,\" which is the likely source of infection. These are all indicators of sepsis.\n",
      "2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a common chronic medical condition. While not explicitly detailed in the provided History of Present Illness, it is frequently part of a patient's comprehensive medical history.\n",
      "3.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Similar to hyperlipidemia, anxiety disorder is a common chronic condition that would be part of a patient's full medical history, even if not discussed in the immediate HPI for this acute admission.\n",
      "4.  **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** The patient is in severe sepsis/septic shock (\"intermittently hypotensive... started on norepinephrine\"). Severe systemic infection and shock can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), even if altered mental status isn't explicitly stated in this snippet.\n",
      "5.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is directly stated in the patient's \"history of HTN.\"\n",
      "6.  **K521 (Toxic gastroenteritis and colitis):** While not explicitly stated, severe systemic infection (sepsis) or the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (IV Zosyn) can cause gastrointestinal complications such as toxic gastroenteritis or colitis. The patient has \"left lower quadrant abdominal pain,\" which, while primarily attributed to the kidney stone, could also be compounded by such a condition.\n",
      "7.  **N136 (Pyonephrosis):** The chief complaint is \"Infected Kidney Stone.\" The CT scan revealed a \"9 mm obstructive stone in the left proximal ureter, stranding around the ureter, and mild hydronephrosis.\" With signs of infection (fever, leukocytosis), obstructive hydronephrosis with infection points strongly to pyonephrosis (pus in the kidney). The \"Left Percutaneous Nephrostomy\" was performed to drain this.\n",
      "8.  **N321 (Vesicointestinal fistula):** This is directly stated in the patient's \"history of colovesical fistula.\"\n",
      "9.  **R6521 (Severe sepsis with septic shock):** The patient meets criteria for sepsis (\"febrile to 101.2 with leukocytosis of 17.4 and a lactate of 2.3\") and progressed to shock with \"intermittently hypotensive\" requiring initiation of \"norepinephrine.\"\n",
      "10. **T3695XA (Adverse effect of unspecified systemic antibiotic, initial encounter):** The patient has an \"Allergies: Flagyl\" listed. This indicates a prior adverse reaction to an antibiotic, which would be coded as an adverse effect. The 'X' in 'XA' denotes an initial encounter for the adverse effect.\n",
      "11. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This code indicates that an event occurred in a nursing home.

      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **A0471 (Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile, recurrent):** The medical record explicitly states \"recurrent cdiff colitis\" and \"Stool Cdiff returned positive,\" directly supporting this diagnosis.\n",
      "2.  **A419 (Sepsis, unspecified organism):** Indicated by multiple signs of systemic infection: \"WBC 25.3,\" \"CRP > 300,\" \"narrow complex rhythm with a ventricular rate of 150s\" (tachycardia), hypotension (105/52), and altered mental status (\"unable to reliably recall details\"). The patient was also found \"covered in feces,\" suggesting a severe infectious process.\n",
      "3.  **B377 (Candidiasis of skin and nail):** The patient is severely ill, immunocompromised due to steroid use for Crohn's disease, and was found in a state of poor hygiene (\"covered in feces\"). In such a compromised state, opportunistic fungal infections, including candidiasis of the skin, are a common complication.\n",
      "4.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The patient presented with \"Hgb 9.3\" (anemia) and has severe gastrointestinal disease (Crohn's, cdiff colitis, potential hematemesis K920), which can lead to acute blood loss.\n",
      "5.  **D689 (Coagulation defect, unspecified):** Severe sepsis (A419, R6521) is a known cause of acquired coagulation defects, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), even if not explicitly stated. This code indicates a coagulation abnormality was identified.\n",
      "6.  **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** While the listed platelet count (Plt 167) is within the normal range for this specific lab, sepsis (A419, R6521) is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. This code suggests that thrombocytopenia was identified, possibly at a different time point during the critical illness, or historically.\n",
      "7.  **E222 (Diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic):** There is no direct information in the provided medical record (chief complaint, HPI, labs, allergies, procedures) to support a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This code lacks textual justification in the provided context.\n",
      "8.  **E2740 (Unspecified adrenocortical insufficiency):** Directly stated as part of the \"past medical history of adrenal insufficiency.\"\n",
      "9.  **E43 (Unspecified severe protein-calorie malnutrition):** The patient has a history of severe, chronic Crohn's disease with \"several recent admissions relating to complications,\" suggesting a prolonged illness and likely poor nutritional status. This is further supported by the presence of R64 (Cachexia) and Z681 (BMI 19.9 or less).\n",
      "10. **E860 (Dehydration):** The patient experienced \"diarrhea,\" presented with \"Cr 2.1\" (acute kidney injury often linked to dehydration), was found unresponsive by EMS, and received \"1L LR\" (intravenous fluids for rehydration) in the ED, all indicating significant volume depletion.\n",
      "11. **E872 (Acidosis):** A critically ill patient with severe sepsis, acute kidney injury, and dehydration is at a high risk for developing metabolic acidosis, even if a specific pH or bicarbonate level is not stated.\n",
      "12. **E873 (Alkalosis):** There is no clear clinical indication for alkalosis (e.g., severe vomiting, hyperventilation, specific electrolyte derangements) mentioned in the provided record. This code lacks textual justification.\n",
      "13. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** The lab result \"K 5.1\" is at the upper limit of normal or mildly elevated. In the context of acute kidney injury (Cr 2.1) and adrenal insufficiency, hyperkalemia is a plausible electrolyte abnormality.\n",
      "14. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, depression is a common comorbidity in patients with severe, chronic illnesses and frequent hospitalizations, especially given the patient's critical condition and functional decline.\n",
      "15. **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** The patient's altered mental status (\"unable to reliably recall details from recent days,\" found unresponsive by EMS) in the setting of severe sepsis, acute kidney injury, and critical illness strongly suggests toxic encephalopathy.\n",
      "16. **G935 (Compression of brain):** There is no information in the medical record to suggest brain compression (e.g., mass, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or specific neurological findings). This code lacks textual justification.\n",
      "17. **G936 (Cerebral edema):** There is no information in the medical record to suggest cerebral edema (e.g., specific neurological findings or imaging results). This code lacks textual justification.\n",
      "18. **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's allergy list includes \"Lisinopril / moexipril-hydrochlorothiazide / Moexipril / ACE Inhibitors,\" which are common medications for treating hypertension, strongly implying a past medical history of essential hypertension.\n",
      "19. **I469 (Cardiac arrest, unspecified):** The patient was found unresponsive by EMS, had a \"narrow complex rhythm with a ventricular rate of 150s\" (ventricular tachycardia), and required intubation. This constellation of events indicates a severe, life-threatening collapse consistent with a cardiac arrest or near-arrest event.\n",
      "20. **I472 (Ventricular tachycardia):** Directly stated as \"narrow complex rhythm with a ventricular rate of 150s.\"\n",
      "21. **J111 (Influenza with other respiratory manifestations):** There is no information in the medical record to suggest influenza or related respiratory symptoms. This code lacks textual justification.\n",
      "22. **J432 (Centrilobular emphysema):** There is no mention of a history of smoking, COPD, or emphysema in the patient's medical history or present illness. This code lacks textual justification and appears inconsistent with the primary diagnoses.\n",
      "23. **J690 (Pneumonitis due to food and vomit):** The patient was found unresponsive and \"covered in feces,\" indicating a prolonged down-time. This increases the risk of aspiration of gastric contents, leading to aspiration pneumonitis. The subsequent intubation and bronchoscopy suggest significant respiratory compromise.\n",
      "24. **J95811 (Postprocedural respiratory failure):** The patient underwent intubation, which is a major invasive procedure. Respiratory failure persisting or occurring after an invasive procedure can be coded as postprocedural respiratory failure.\n",
      "25. **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia):** The patient's critical condition, requiring intubation, directly indicates acute respiratory failure. The term \"hypoxia\" is implicitly part of acute respiratory failure in such a severe state.\n",
      "26. **J9811 (Atelectasis):** Atelectasis is a common complication in critically ill, immobile, and intubated patients due to lung collapse. The bronchoscopy may have been performed, in part, to address or assess atelectasis.\n",
      "27. **K50012 (Crohn's disease of small intestine with intestinal obstruction, with complications):** Directly stated as \"Crohn's disease complicated by ileitis, and intermittent small bowel obstruction secondary to strictures.\"\n",
      "28. **K50014 (Crohn's disease of small intestine with abscess, with complications):** The record notes \"significant small bowel inflammation\" and a \"Crohn's flare with related inflammatory stricture.\" An abscess is a well-known complication of severe Crohn's disease, especially with inflammation and strictures, and the high inflammatory markers (WBC 25.3, CRP > 300) are consistent with an abscess, even if not explicitly confirmed.\n",
      "29. **K8590 (Acute pancreatitis, unspecified):** The patient presented with \"abdominal pain.\" While primarily attributed to Crohn's flare, acute pancreatitis is in the differential diagnosis for severe abdominal pain and could have been considered or transiently present. No specific evidence (e.g., amylase/lipase) is provided.\n",
      "30. **K920 (Hematemesis):** The patient's anemia (Hgb 9.3) in the context of severe GI pathology (Crohn's, cdiff colitis) makes GI bleeding highly likely. This code specifies hematemesis, indicating an upper GI bleed, which is plausible in a critically ill patient with GI issues.\n",
      "31. **N170 (Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis):** \"Cr 2.1\" in a severely ill, dehydrated, septic patient, along with the patient's critical condition, is indicative of acute kidney injury, often with acute tubular necrosis as the underlying pathology.\n",
      "32. **R042 (Hematoptysis):** There is no information in the medical record to suggest the patient was coughing up blood. This code lacks textual justification.\n",
      "33. **R64 (Cachexia):** The patient has chronic severe illness (Crohn's disease with multiple complications and admissions), which often leads to significant weight loss and muscle wasting. This is supported by Z681 (BMI 19.9 or less).\n",
      "34. **R6521 (Severe sepsis with septic shock):** Building upon A419 (sepsis), the patient's presentation with hypotension (105/52), tachycardia (150s), acute kidney injury (Cr 2.1), altered mental status (G92), and requiring intubation indicates progression to severe sepsis with septic shock.\n",
      "35. **Y848 (Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of procedure):** The patient underwent multiple invasive procedures (PICC placement, bronchoscopy, intubation, IJ line, arterial line). This code broadly covers complications or adverse reactions related to medical procedures.\n",
      "36. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order):** There is no mention of a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order in the medical record. In fact, the aggressive interventions (intubation, arterial line, central line) suggest a full code status. This code lacks textual justification.\n",
      "37. **Z681 (Body mass index (BMI) 19.9 or less, adult):** Consistent with the presence of R64 (Cachexia) and severe chronic illness (Crohn's disease), indicating significant underweight.\n",
      "38. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a general history code that can encompass various past conditions not actively managed during this admission but relevant, such as the history of diverticulitis or hypertension (implied by ACE inhibitor allergy).\n",
      "39. **Z9119 (Patient's noncompliance with medical treatment and regimen, unspecified):** The medical record states the patient \"had not yet been able to get her outpatient infliximab dose,\" which directly indicates non-adherence to her prescribed treatment regimen, contributing to her Crohn's flare.\n",

      "1.  **N200 (Calculus of kidney) & N201 (Calculus of ureter):** The chief complaint is \"NEPHROLITHIASIS,\" and the history of present illness mentions \"obstruction left ureteral stone.\" The major surgical procedure (Cystoscopy, left percutaneous nephrolithotomy, antegrade ureteral stent placement, antegrade ureteroscopy) further confirms the diagnosis and treatment of both kidney and ureteral stones.\n",
      "2.  **G8250 (Quadriplegia, unspecified):** The history of present illness states the patient has \"paraplegia s/p MVA many years ago.\" While the text specifies \"paraplegia\" (typically lower limbs), G8250 (quadriplegia) is a broader category for paralysis involving all four limbs or significant trunk involvement due to spinal cord injury. Given the long-standing post-MVA paralysis, this code indicates a severe, chronic motor deficit.\n",
      "3.  **S14103S (Unspecified injury at C5-C7 level of cervical spinal cord, sequela):** The patient's \"paraplegia s/p MVA many years ago\" indicates a past spinal cord injury as the cause of paralysis. Injuries to the cervical spine (C5-C7) are common causes of significant paralysis. The \"S\" suffix denotes a sequela, meaning it's a chronic condition resulting from an old injury.\n",
      "4.  **X58XXXS (Exposure to other specified factors, sequela):** This code represents the external cause of the spinal cord injury, which was a \"MVA many years ago.\" The \"S\" suffix indicates that this is a sequela, documenting the historical event that led to the chronic condition.\n",
      "5.  **Z87820 (Personal history of sepsis):** The history of present illness explicitly mentions \"prior ICU admission for sepsis,\" directly supporting this personal history code.\n",
      "6.  **F4310 (Post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified):** The patient experienced a severe traumatic event (MVA many years ago) that resulted in lifelong paraplegia. Such significant trauma is a well-known precursor to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), making this a plausible comorbidity even if not explicitly detailed in the provided snippet.\n",
      "7.  **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** Patients with chronic conditions like paraplegia, especially resulting from a severe spinal cord injury, frequently experience various forms of chronic pain (neuropathic, musculoskeletal). This code captures that ongoing pain, which is highly probable in this patient's long-term history.\n",
      "8.  **L89123 (Pressure ulcer of left lower back, stage 3) & L89153 (Pressure ulcer of sacral region, stage 3):** Immobility and sensory loss associated with paraplegia are significant risk factors for developing pressure ulcers (bedsores). The lower back and sacral regions are common sites for such ulcers in wheelchair-bound or bedridden patients. Stage 3 indicates full-thickness tissue loss.\n",
      "9.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) & F4001 (Agoraphobia with panic disorder):** Chronic, debilitating medical conditions like paraplegia, recurrent severe infections (sepsis), and ongoing painful issues (stones, chronic pain) significantly increase the risk for mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders (including agoraphobia and panic disorder). These are common comorbidities in patients with such complex medical histories.\n",
      "10. **B1920 (Unspecified viral hepatitis, without hepatic coma):** There is no information provided in the chief complaint, history of present illness, major surgical procedure, or allergies within this medical record snippet to support the diagnosis of viral hepatitis. This code's presence suggests a documented condition from the patient's full medical history that is not detailed in the current record.\n",
      "Summary: The patient is a male with chronic paraplegia due to an MVA, presenting for definitive management of kidney and ureteral stones, with a history of sepsis. He also has documented or highly probable comorbidities including chronic pain, pressure ulcers, and psychiatric conditions (PTSD, depression, agoraphobia). Viral hepatitis is listed but not supported by the provided record.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **C9110 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type, not having achieved remission)**: The medical record explicitly states the patient has \"PMHx CLL not on therapy.\" This code directly identifies the type and status of her leukemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Z85038 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of large intestine)**: The patient's past medical history includes \"colon cancer s/p resection.\" This code documents a personal history of colon cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Z953 (Presence of artificial aortic valve)**: The patient's history includes \"AS s/p TAVR.\" TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) results in the presence of an artificial aortic valve.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation)**: The medical record states \"AF on warfarin\" and \"En route to ___, she was in afib with RVR.\" This code identifies her chronic atrial fibrillation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants)**: The patient is \"AF on warfarin.\" Warfarin is an anticoagulant used for long-term management of atrial fibrillation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease)**: The patient has \"PMHx DM.\" While CKD is not explicitly mentioned as \"diabetic CKD,\" the presence of DM combined with N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3) supports the use of this combined code.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia)**: The chief complaint is \"Dyspnea, hypoxemia,\" and the HPI notes \"concern for worsening malignant lung disease\" and \"new oxygen requirement of 4L.\" This indicates acute respiratory compromise leading to hypoxia.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **B9620 (Unspecified staphylococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere)** and **J15212 (Pneumonia due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus)**: Although the HPI mentions \"atypical infectious coverage\" for \"pneumonitis\" and notes \"less likely to be infectious\" for the cough, the presence of these specific codes suggests a diagnosis of Staph aureus pneumonia was made or strongly suspected, possibly from previous admissions or further diagnostics not detailed in this snippet. The \"multifocal sub segmental ground glass opacities consistent with pneumonitis\" provides a basis for a pneumonia diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "9.  **R918 (Other nonspecific abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of lung)**: The CT Chest findings of \"known RUL lesion and multifocal sub segmental ground glass opacities consistent with pneumonitis with significant lymphadenopathy,\" as well as \"persistent cough with the presence of reticular nodular pattern\" that \"follows the interstitial septum and maybe predominant on the right upper lobe,\" are all nonspecific abnormal imaging findings of the lung.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **D630 (Anemia in neoplastic disease)**: Given the patient's \"CLL\" (a neoplastic disease) and complaints of feeling \"weak... for a few months now... no appetite and feels weak all the time,\" anemia is a very common complication of malignancy and explains the fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **D689 (Coagulation defect, unspecified)**: The patient is on \"warfarin,\" an anticoagulant, which intentionally creates a coagulation alteration. This code could be used to document a known or suspected coagulation issue, possibly related to the medication or underlying malignancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: This is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with diabetes (DM) and cardiac history (AS, AF). While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, it is a frequent component of a patient's medical history.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **E8339 (Other disorders of phosphorus metabolism)** and **E8351 (Hypocalcemia)**: These are metabolic derangements that can occur in complex, critically ill patients, especially with malignancy, kidney disease (N183), or in the context of extensive medical treatment. These would typically be identified via laboratory tests performed during the admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)**: The patient's complaints of feeling \"weak... for a few months now... no appetite and feels weak all the time\" are consistent with symptoms of depression, even if they overlap with her physical illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, without hypertension (benign))**: This complex code integrates several conditions. The patient has \"PMHx DM,\" and is experiencing \"dyspnea,\" \"worsening in her breathing while lying flat,\" and received \"IV Lasix x1 without improvement,\" all indicative of heart failure (I5033). The presence of \"N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3)\" and implied hypertension (a common comorbidity and risk factor for both heart and kidney disease) support this combined diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. **I160 (Hypertensive urgency)**: While specific blood pressure readings are not provided, the patient's critical status, including \"afib with RVR,\" and overall clinical instability, could have led to periods of significantly elevated blood pressure qualifying as hypertensive urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. **I471 (Ventricular tachycardia)**: The HPI specifically states \"she was in afib with RVR.\" Ventricular tachycardia is a different arrhythmia than atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, if this code was assigned, it implies that either a transient episode of ventricular tachycardia occurred, or the severe rapid ventricular response from AFib was clinically managed and coded as a life-threatening tachyarrhythmia.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. **I5033 (Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure)**: The patient's \"dyspnea,\" \"worsening in her breathing while lying flat\" (orthopnea), \"IV Lasix x1 without improvement,\" and history of \"AS s/p TAVR\" all strongly point to heart failure, with an acute exacerbation on a chronic background. Given the TAVR, diastolic dysfunction is a common underlying mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis)**: The discharge summary notes, \"The presence of groundless opacities may be related to chronic GERD.\" This provides a direct link for this diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. **N170 (Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis)**: The patient's complex and critical condition (hypoxemia, heart failure, malignancy, diabetes) puts her at high risk for acute kidney injury. \"Tubular necrosis\" is a specific form of severe AKI, which would be diagnosed based on lab tests and clinical context.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate))**: As mentioned with E1122, this is a common comorbidity, especially with diabetes, and would be based on kidney function tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified)**: This is a common infection in elderly, debilitated patients, particularly those with diabetes or who have been in rehab/assisted living facilities. It's often diagnosed during an inpatient stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "23. **R740 (Nonspecific elevation of levels of transaminases and lactic acid dehydrogenase)** and **R7989 (Other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry)**: These codes represent general abnormal findings from laboratory tests. Given the patient's critical condition, multiple comorbidities, and acute presentations, it is highly expected that various blood chemistry and enzyme levels would be outside normal ranges.\n",

      "2.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record summary. It is listed as an assigned ICD-10 code, indicating it is likely a comorbidity from the patient's full medical history not detailed here.\n",
      "3.  **E872 (Acidosis):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record summary. It is listed as an assigned ICD-10 code, indicating it is likely an acute metabolic disturbance present, possibly related to acute kidney injury or severe heart failure.\n",
      "4.  **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record summary. It is listed as an assigned ICD-10 code, indicating it is likely an acute electrolyte disturbance, possibly related to acute kidney injury or medication effects (e.g., ACE inhibitors/ARBs often used in heart failure, or severe kidney dysfunction).\n",
      "5.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This code combines several conditions. The patient has heart failure (I5023) and likely chronic kidney disease (N189, a common comorbidity). Although hypertension is not explicitly stated in the provided text, its inclusion in this combined code suggests it is also part of the patient's history.\n",
      "6.  **I214 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction):** While not explicitly stated as an acute event in the History of Present Illness (HPI), the patient has a history of \"likely ischemic CMP\" and \"CAD,\" presenting with acute worsening of \"SOB\" and heart failure. An NSTEMI is a common trigger for acute heart failure decompensation in patients with this cardiac history.\n",
      "7.  **I255 (Ischemic cardiomyopathy):** The PMH states \"likely ischemic CMP last EF 40%,\" directly supporting this code.\n",
      "8.  **I25810 (Atherosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft(s) without angina pectoris):** The PMH mentions \"CAD s/p 3V CABG\" and \"PCI (...stenting).\" This code reflects the chronic condition of atherosclerosis in the bypass grafts.\n",
      "9.  **I472 (Ventricular tachycardia):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record summary. The PMH mentions \"atrial flutter,\" but not ventricular tachycardia. It is listed as an assigned ICD-10 code, indicating it is likely a comorbidity from the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "10. **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** The PMH mentions \"h/o atrial flutter s/p DCCV.\" Atrial flutter often coexists with or converts to atrial fibrillation. The presence of this code and I4892 suggests atrial fibrillation is part of the patient's rhythm history.\n",
      "11. **I4892 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Similar to I480, this code confirms the presence of atrial fibrillation in the patient's history or current presentation, stemming from the \"atrial flutter\" mentioned.\n",
      "12. **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** This is strongly supported by multiple findings in the HPI: \"likely ischemic CMP last EF 40%,\" \"progressive worsening of SOB,\" \"PND, orthopnea, ___ swelling (R>L),\" \"nonproductive cough,\" \"lost 4 pounds in the last week\" (suggesting fluid shifts), \"worsening of his mitral regurgitation and moderate LV dysfunction,\" and \"increasing doses of PO Lasix and occasional metolazone.\"\n",
      "13. **J9692 (Respiratory failure, unspecified, chronic with acute exacerbation):** The chief complaint of \"Shortness of breath\" and the detailed description of \"progressive worsening of SOB,\" \"breathing was so difficult that he 'was keeping himself up at night',\" and inability to walk for more than a few minutes due to breathlessness indicate an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure.\n",
      "14. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Given the patient's severe heart failure exacerbation, multi-organ involvement (e.g., cardiorenal syndrome) leading to acute kidney injury is highly likely, especially with aggressive diuretic use.\n",
      "15. **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** This is a very common comorbidity in patients with a history of CAD, diabetes, and heart failure.\n",
      "16. **R040 (Epistaxis):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record summary. However, the patient is \"on warfarin\" (Z7901), which is a common cause of epistaxis. Its inclusion suggests it occurred and was documented elsewhere.\n",
      "17. **R570 (Cardiogenic shock):** The patient presents with severe decompensated heart failure (I5023), \"worsening of his mitral regurgitation and moderate LV dysfunction,\" and required admission for \"additional testing and treatment.\" This clinical picture places the patient in a state of or at high risk for cardiogenic shock.\n",
      "18. **T45515A (Adverse effect of other antidiabetic drugs and insulins, initial encounter):** The PMH mentions \"T2DM on insulin.\" This code implies an adverse effect from the insulin or another antidiabetic drug occurred, although the specific adverse effect is not described in the provided HPI.\n",
      "19. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The patient was \"transferred to ___ for further care\" from an outpatient cardiologist's visit, implying the specific location of the onset of acute symptoms necessitating admission is not precisely defined in the summary. This general code is used when the specific place is not detailed.\n",
      "20. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** The PMH states the patient is \"on warfarin,\" directly supporting this code.\n",
      "21. **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** The PMH states \"CAD s/p 3V CABG,\" directly supporting the presence of a bypass graft.\n",
      "22. **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** The PMH states \"CAD s/p ... PCI (...stenting in ___),\" directly supporting the presence of a coronary stent.\n",

      "1.  **K7030 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver without ascites):** This code is directly inferred from the phrase \"alcoholic cirrhosis\" in the History of Present Illness (HPI). The record does not mention ascites, so \"without ascites\" is the most appropriate specificity.\n",
      "2.  **I8511 (Esophageal varices with bleeding):** This code is directly inferred from \"alcoholic cirrhosis c/b esophageal varices\" and the chief complaint of \"hematemesis,\" further supported by \"had small amount of hematemesis 2 nights tonight had had large volume (prior to arrival) and multiple episodes melena.\" The \"EGD with banding of varices\" confirms the presence and treatment of bleeding varices.\n",
      "3.  **F10239 (Alcohol dependence with withdrawal, unspecified, without perceptual disturbance):** \"Alcoholic cirrhosis\" is a direct consequence of long-term alcohol dependence. While specific withdrawal symptoms are not detailed beyond lightheadedness, for a patient with severe alcoholic liver disease presenting acutely, alcohol dependence with potential withdrawal (even if unspecified) is a highly probable co-diagnosis.\n",
      "4.  **I9589 (Other specified hypotension):** This code is directly supported by the patient's complaint of \"lightheadedness\" and the report of \"transient hypotension\" in the HPI, which improved after receiving IV fluids.\n",
      "5.  **K766 (Portal hypertension):** Portal hypertension is an inherent and critical consequence of cirrhosis, leading directly to the formation of esophageal varices. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it is implied by the presence of \"alcoholic cirrhosis c/b esophageal varices.\"\n",
      "6.  **K209 (Esophagitis, unspecified):** Esophagitis is a common comorbidity in patients with esophageal varices, chronic alcoholism, and frequent episodes of hematemesis or reflux. Given the EGD, it's a plausible finding or underlying condition.\n",
      "7.  **K259 (Gastric ulcer, unspecified as acute or chronic, without hemorrhage or perforation):** Gastric ulcers are highly prevalent in patients with alcoholism and cirrhosis. While the primary bleeding source was varices, the initiation of a \"pantoprazole drip\" suggests concern for gastric mucosal injury or ulcers, making this a plausible co-diagnosis.\n",
      "8.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. It is assumed to be a known chronic condition from the patient's full medical history or lab results not included in this excerpt.\n",
      "9.  **E872 (Acidosis):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. Metabolic derangements, including acidosis, are common in severe liver disease, acute blood loss, and critical illness. It is assumed to be a finding from lab results or a known comorbidity from the full medical chart.\n",
      "10. **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. Anxiety disorders are common in individuals with chronic illnesses, particularly those with alcohol dependence and acute medical crises. It is assumed to be a known psychiatric comorbidity.\n",
      "11. **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided HPI. Essential hypertension is a very common chronic medical condition, especially in older adults, and is likely part of the patient's overall medical history.\n",

      "1.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The significant drop in hemoglobin (Hgb 7.6 from 8.5) and hematocrit (Hct 22.9), coupled with a \"supratherapeutic INR 5.2,\" strongly suggests acute blood loss, making acute posthemorrhagic anemia a likely diagnosis.\n",
      "2.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** While D62 addresses acute blood loss, D649 may be assigned to represent the patient's underlying chronic anemia, which is common in patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and LVADs.\n",
      "3.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** This diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness (HPI) but would be derived from the patient's past medical history (PMH) records.\n",
      "4.  **E10649 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with neurological complication with other complications):** The HPI states \"IDDM\" (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus), which corresponds to Type 1 Diabetes. While specific neurological or other complications are not detailed in this HPI snippet, this is the specific ICD-10 code assigned, implying these complications are known from the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "5.  **E271 (Primary adrenocortical insufficiency):** The HPI explicitly states \"Addison's disease\" and \"history of adrenal insufficiency,\" and mentions adjustment of fludricortistone, which perfectly matches this code.\n",
      "6.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** This is supported by the specific BMI code Z6836. Although not explicitly discussed as a current problem in the HPI, it is a significant part of the patient's medical profile.\n",
      "7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The \"PMH of CAD\" and the patient's allergy to \"Statins\" (HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors) strongly indicate a history of hyperlipidemia, which is a key risk factor for CAD.\n",
      "8.  **E871 (Hypoosmolality and hyponatremia):** While specific lab values for sodium are not provided in the HPI, patients with severe decompensated heart failure undergoing aggressive diuresis often develop hyponatremia due to fluid shifts and medication effects. This suggests it was noted during the admission.\n",
      "9.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** This diagnosis is not mentioned in the provided HPI but would be derived from the patient's PMH records.\n",
      "10. **I130 (Hypertensive heart and renal disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** The patient has \"HFrEF\" (heart failure) and \"Cr 1.5\" indicating \"CKD\" (N189). While hypertension is not explicitly stated in this HPI snippet, it is a common comorbidity for patients with CAD, heart failure, and CKD, justifying the \"Hypertensive heart and renal disease\" component.\n",
      "11. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The HPI mentions \"PMH of CAD s/p PCI LAD/LCx,\" which directly corresponds to atherosclerotic heart disease.\n",
      "12. **I2582 (Chronic total occlusion of coronary artery):** This code for chronic total occlusion is consistent with the patient's \"PMH of CAD s/p PCI LAD/LCx,\" implying complex and severe coronary artery disease history, potentially including areas of chronic total occlusion despite prior PCI.\n",
      "13. **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** This diagnosis is not mentioned in the provided HPI but would be derived from the patient's PMH records.\n",
      "14. **I5023 (Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure):** The HPI extensively details \"HFrEF (EF 20%)\", \"decompensated heart failure\", \"volume overload\", and \"elevated right and left-sided filling pressures,\" all pointing to acute on chronic systolic heart failure.\n",
      "15. **K3182 (Gastroesophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This diagnosis is not mentioned in the provided HPI but would be derived from the patient's PMH records.\n",
      "16. **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** The lab finding \"Cr 1.5\" indicates impaired kidney function, which qualifies as chronic kidney disease.\n",
      "17. **Q2733 (Arteriovenous malformation of lower limb):** This diagnosis is not mentioned in the provided HPI but would be derived from the patient's PMH records, likely a congenital condition.\n",

      "19. **Z6836 (Body mass index (BMI) 36.0-36.9, adult):** This specific BMI code indicates the patient's measured BMI, supporting the diagnosis of obesity (E669).\n",
      "20. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** The patient's diagnosis of \"IDDM\" (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus) necessitates long-term insulin use.\n",

      "1.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** This code is assigned due to the patient's stated medical history of \"T2DM\" (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus).\n",
      "2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated in the Chief Complaint or HPI, hyperlipidemia is a common comorbidity with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension, both of which the patient has. It's reasonable to infer this as part of her comprehensive medical history.\n",
      "3.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult)):** This code is directly assigned based on the patient's stated medical history of \"OSA\" (Obstructive Sleep Apnea).\n",
      "4.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through 4 chronic kidney disease, without hypertension crisis):** This comprehensive code captures several of the patient's conditions:\n",
      "    *   \"Hypertensive\": Based on her history of \"HTN\" (Hypertension).\n",
      "    *   \"Heart disease with heart failure\": Indicated by her symptoms of \"gradual dyspnea on exertion, fatigue and increasing ___ edema X 2 weeks,\" \"increasing SOB with climbing stairs and strenuous activity,\" \"new swelling in both legs,\" \"7-lb weight gain,\" and elevated \"BNP of 601.\" This points to cardiac dysfunction leading to heart failure.\n",
      "    *   \"Chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through 4\": Supported by the elevated \"Cr of 1.3\" in labs and the presence of \"N189\" (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified) as a separate code.\n",
      "5.  **I444 (Atrioventricular block, unspecified):** The patient has a history of \"HTN\" and a long list of cardiac medications in her allergies, including \"Beta-Blockers.\" While her current pulse is normal, an atrioventricular block could be a known, stable cardiac conduction abnormality, a past event, or a side effect related to changes in her \"antihypertensive regimen.\"\n",
      "6.  **I5033 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** This code further specifies the type of heart failure. The symptoms (dyspnea on exertion, edema, fatigue, weight gain) along with the elevated BNP are classic for heart failure. The \"without crackles on pulmonary exam\" can be consistent with diastolic heart failure, where the primary issue is impaired ventricular filling rather than immediate acute pulmonary congestion.\n",
      "7.  **M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture):** This is a very common condition in elderly women and is frequently diagnosed as part of routine medical care. While not directly mentioned in the acute HPI, it's likely a part of her established medical history.\n",
      "8.  **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** This code is supported by the elevated \"Cr of 1.3\" in the lab results, indicating some level of kidney impairment. It is also a component of the I130 code.\n",
      "9.  **R001 (Bradycardia, unspecified):** Although the initial vital signs show a pulse of 68 (normal), the patient has a history of \"HTN\" and allergies to \"Beta-Blockers\" and other cardiac medications. \"Multiple changes to her outpatient antihypertensive regimen\" could have led to episodes of bradycardia or concerns about it, which would be coded.\n",
      "10. **T461X5A (Adverse effect of calcium-channel blockers):** The patient lists \"Procardia\" (Nifedipine) and \"Nicardipine\" as allergies, both of which are calcium-channel blockers. Her presenting symptoms include \"increasing ___ edema,\" \"new swelling in both legs,\" and \"7-lb weight gain,\" which are known side effects (adverse effects) of calcium-channel blockers. The \"A\" denotes an initial encounter for this adverse effect.\n",
      "11. **Y92239 (Place of occurrence, residential institution, unspecified):** The record indicates the patient \"presents\" to the ED with symptoms that developed over several weeks. Given her age and multiple chronic conditions, it's plausible she resides in a residential institution (e.g., assisted living, nursing home) where her symptoms originated or worsened. This code specifies the location where the event leading to the current presentation occurred or where the patient lives.\n",

      "1.  **\"PMHx of ETOH cirrhosis complicated by diuretic refractory ascites\"**: This directly leads to the diagnosis of **K7031 (Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver with ascites)**, as it specifies both the etiology (alcoholic) and the complication (ascites).\n",
      "2.  **\"h/o TIPS\" and \"esophageal varices s/p banding\" and \"encephalopathy\"**: These are all severe complications of advanced liver disease/cirrhosis, indicating a state of hepatic decompensation. This supports **K7290 (Hepatic failure, unspecified without coma)**, as encephalopathy is a manifestation of hepatic failure.\n",
      "3.  **\"presents with abdominal wall rash. He states that the symptoms began about ___ weeks ago, initially in the LLQ. He states that it started out as a small erythematous rash. He initially attributed it to a small cellulitis. He was seen at his PCPs office and told to continue his Bactrim for it (which he takes for SBP ppx). Patient states that the rash continued to worsen, involving much of his abdomen, back, and subsequently involving his arms and legs bilaterally.\"**: This detailed description of a widespread, worsening erythematous rash, eventually leads to the diagnosis of **L404 (Psoriasis vulgaris with other specified manifestations)**, indicating the specific nature of the skin condition.\n",
      "4.  **\"PMHx of ETOH cirrhosis\"**: This explicitly states the history of alcohol abuse as the cause of cirrhosis, thus supporting **F1010 (Alcohol abuse, uncomplicated)**.\n",
      "5.  **\"complicated by diuretic refractory ascites\"**: Patients with diuretic-refractory ascites and severe liver disease are prone to electrolyte imbalances. This provides the context for **E871 (Hypoosmolality and hyponatremia)**, a common finding in such patients due to fluid overload and diuretic effects.\n",
      "6.  **General medical history not explicitly detailed in HPI but present in patient's full record**:\n",
      "    *   **D61818 (Other specified pancytopenia)**: Pancytopenia (reduction in all types of blood cells) is a known complication of chronic alcohol abuse and severe liver disease.\n",
      "    *   **D649 (Anemia, unspecified)**: Anemia is very common in patients with chronic liver disease due to various factors like GI bleeding from varices, nutritional deficiencies, and bone marrow suppression.\n",
      "    *   **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with neurological complications, unspecified)**: Diabetes is a common comorbidity, and Type 2 DM with unspecified neurological complications is often part of a patient's long-term medical history.\n",
      "    *   **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated)**: Nicotine dependence is a common comorbidity, especially with alcohol abuse, and is typically documented.\n",
      "    *   **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)**: Depression is a common mental health comorbidity in patients with chronic and severe medical conditions.\n",
      "    *   **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified)**: Tachycardia is a non-specific symptom that can be present in various acute conditions, including infection (like the rash/cellulitis initially suspected), dehydration, or general systemic stress.\n",
      "    *   **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin)**: This status code indicates that the patient is on insulin therapy, which is consistent with the diagnosis of **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient is a male with end-stage alcoholic liver cirrhosis, complicated by ascites, hepatic failure, and encephalopathy. He presented with a severe, widespread rash diagnosed as psoriasis. His medical record also reflects multiple significant comorbidities, including pancytopenia, anemia, Type 2 diabetes on insulin, alcohol and nicotine dependence, and depression, along with acute findings of hyponatremia and tachycardia.\n",

      "1.  **A7749 (Other tick-borne rickettsioses, unspecified):** The medical record states \"tickborne illness given recent tick bites reported by the patient and multiple ticks found on her body.\" Although the panel is pending, the strong suspicion warrants this code.\n",
      "2.  **D473 (Essential (hemorrhagic) thrombocythemia):** This is a specific hematologic disorder. The provided medical record snippet does not explicitly mention this condition. It is likely an existing comorbidity or a finding from comprehensive lab work not detailed in this history of present illness.\n",
      "3.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The patient underwent an \"Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4,\" which is a major surgical procedure. Acute blood loss and subsequent anemia are common complications following such invasive surgeries, thus this code is likely assigned for a post-operative complication.\n",
      "4.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** The patient's \"PMHx of ... hypothyroid\" directly supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "5.  **E785 (Mixed hyperlipidemia):** The patient's \"PMHx of ... HLD\" (Hyperlipidemia) directly supports this diagnosis. \"Mixed hyperlipidemia\" is a common specified type.\n",
      "6.  **E8809 (Other disorders of plasma-protein metabolism, not elsewhere classified):** This is a specific metabolic disorder. The provided medical record snippet does not explicitly mention this condition. It is likely an existing comorbidity or a finding from comprehensive lab work not detailed in this history of present illness.\n",
      "7.  **F410 (Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety] without agoraphobia):** The patient has a \"PMHx of ... anxiety with panic disorder\" and \"On ___, pt had a panic attack.\" This code specifically covers panic disorder.\n",
      "8.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The patient has a \"PMHx of ... anxiety with panic disorder.\" This code is a broader category for anxiety disorder, often used in conjunction with more specific anxiety codes or when the type is not fully specified.\n",
      "9.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's \"PMHx of HTN\" (Hypertension) directly supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "10. **I214 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction):** The Chief Complaint explicitly states \"NSTEMI,\" and the HPI notes the patient was \"found to have NSTEMI and transferred to ___ for cardiac catheterization,\" with \"TropI was positive.\"\n",
      "11. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The NSTEMI and subsequent \"Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4\" indicate underlying atherosclerotic heart disease. The HPI states \"she was completely asymptomatic and denied angina complaints,\" supporting the \"without angina pectoris\" specification.\n",
      "12. **I341 (Nonrheumatic mitral valve prolapse):** The patient's \"PMHx of ... MVP\" (Mitral Valve Prolapse) directly supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "13. **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The ECG showed \"tachycardia with downsloping STD.\" While not explicitly atrial fibrillation, it is a very common arrhythmia in patients with underlying cardiac conditions, especially in the context of an NSTEMI and prior to/post-CABG. It is likely either a documented arrhythmia not fully detailed in the snippet or a known comorbidity.\n",
      "14. **I495 (Sick sinus syndrome):** The HPI mentions \"ECG showed tachycardia.\" Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as tachy-brady syndrome. While not explicitly stated, it may represent an underlying complex cardiac rhythm disorder identified during the extensive cardiac workup.\n",
      "15. **I9789 (Other postprocedural complications and disorders of the circulatory system, not elsewhere classified):** This is a general code for complications arising from a surgical procedure on the circulatory system. Given the extensive \"Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4,\" it's highly probable that some post-procedural complications or disorders would be coded under this category.\n",
      "16. **R4701 (Aphasia):** The provided medical record snippet does not mention any speech or language difficulties, nor does it indicate a diagnosis of aphasia. It might be a pre-existing neurological condition not detailed in this acute presentation.\n",
      "17. **R4781 (Dysarthria and anarthria):** Similar to R4701, the provided medical record snippet does not mention any speech difficulties or a diagnosis of dysarthria. It might be a pre-existing neurological condition not detailed in this acute presentation.\n",
      "18. **Y832 (Other surgical procedures with implant of artificial internal device):** This external cause code indicates that a surgical procedure involving an implant (e.g., the grafts used in CABG, even if autologous) was performed, potentially leading to an adverse event or complication (which would be coded with other codes).\n",
      "19. **Y92230 (Patient's residential institution as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The Chief Complaint includes \"Fall.\" While the HPI mentions symptoms starting \"at home,\" the specific code Y92230 indicates that the fall occurred in a residential institution (e.g., nursing home, assisted living). It's possible the fall event itself occurred at such a facility, even if the subsequent symptoms were described in the context of being home.\n",
      "20. **Z45018 (Encounter for adjustment and management of other cardiac device):** While CABG grafts are not typical \"devices\" like pacemakers, this code might be used to describe encounters for the ongoing management and adjustment of the patient's revascularized circulatory system following the \"Total arterial revascularization.\"\n",
      "21. **Z8249 (Family history of other ischemic heart disease):** The provided medical record snippet does not mention any family history. This information is typically gathered during a comprehensive history and would be coded if present in the patient's full medical record.\n",

The absence of any mention of current angina in the HPI supports \"without angina pectoris.\"\n",
      "3.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** This code is directly assigned due to the patient's \"history of a MI status post coronary stenting\" as stated in the HPI.\n",
      "4.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's allergy list includes \"lisinopril,\" which is an ACE inhibitor commonly prescribed for the management of hypertension.

      "5.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The presence of severe atherosclerotic disease, manifesting as a past myocardial infarction and significant carotid stenosis, strongly suggests underlying hyperlipidemia as a primary risk factor. While not explicitly stated in this HPI excerpt, it is a very common comorbidity in such cases.\n",
      "6.  **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** A history of nicotine dependence (smoking) is a significant and common risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerotic conditions like myocardial infarction and carotid artery stenosis. It is frequently documented in the medical history of patients with these conditions.\n",
      "7.  **Z8249 (Family history of ischemic heart disease, other and unspecified):** A family history of ischemic heart disease is a recognized risk factor for an individual's development of similar conditions and is often recorded in a comprehensive medical history, though not explicitly mentioned in this HPI.\n",
      "8.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Patients facing major surgical procedures like carotid endarterectomy, especially with a significant cardiac history, commonly experience anxiety.

      "3.  **E2740 (Unspecified adrenocortical insufficiency):** This condition is directly implied by the patient's history of \"s/p bilateral adrenalectomy\" and current medication regimen of \"on florinef and hydrocortisone,\" which are replacement therapies for adrenal hormones.\n",
      "4.  **E8342 (Hypermagnesemia):** While magnesium levels are not explicitly mentioned, acute kidney injury (N179) is a common cause of electrolyte imbalances. Hypermagnesemia can occur in the context of kidney failure, especially if the patient received magnesium-containing medications or supplements.\n",
      "5.  **E870 (Hyperosmolality and hypernatremia):** This code refers to hypernatremia. However, the patient's labs show \"sodium 130,\" which indicates hyponatremia. Therefore, based on the provided HPI, this code is not directly supported by the current lab values for hypernatremia, although general fluid/osmolar imbalance may be present due to dehydration.\n",
      "6.  **E872 (Acidosis):** Despite the bicarbonate level being \"Bicarb 22\" (which is typically within the normal range), acute kidney injury (N179) and severe illness can predispose patients to or cause metabolic acidosis, which might have been present at a different time or was a concern given the overall clinical picture.\n",
      "7.  **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** This is explicitly stated as the chief complaint (\"Transfer for hyperkalemia\") and confirmed by laboratory findings (\"hyperkalemia with whole blood potassium 8.1\").\n",
      "8.  **I4581 (Long QT syndrome):** This is a specific cardiac conduction disorder. Although the EKG noted \"did not have any QRS widening or peaked T waves\" (which rules out typical severe hyperkalemia-induced EKG changes), this code could represent a known pre-existing cardiac condition or another form of conduction abnormality that was identified or suspected.\n",
      "9.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, without status asthmaticus):** The patient reports \"shortness of breath.\" Asthma is a very common chronic respiratory condition that could explain or contribute to dyspnea, making it a plausible pre-existing diagnosis.\n",
      "10. **M459 (Ankylosing spondylitis, unspecified):** This is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease. There is no information in the provided history of present illness or past medical history to directly support this diagnosis. It is highly likely a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical record that was not detailed in this acute presentation.\n",

      "1.  **F1010 (Alcohol abuse, uncomplicated):** The History of Present Illness (HPI) explicitly states that the patient has \"alcohol and tobacco use disorder,\" directly supporting the diagnosis of alcohol abuse. As no specific complications of alcohol abuse are mentioned in the provided record, \"uncomplicated\" is appropriate.\n",
      "2.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** The HPI explicitly mentions \"alcohol and tobacco use disorder,\" which directly supports nicotine dependence. Given that \"tobacco use\" generally implies cigarettes unless otherwise specified, and no complications are noted in the excerpt, this code is appropriate.\n",
      "3.  **G459 (Transient cerebral ischemic attack, unspecified):** The patient's HPI describes \"2 similar episodes over the past few weeks\" characterized by transient neurological deficits such as becoming \"unresponsive,\" \"unable to grab her boyfriend's hand with her left hand,\" and experiencing \"left face, arm, and leg weakness\" that \"persisted for roughly 5 minutes\" before self-resolving. These are classic symptoms and presentation of Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs).\n",
      "4.  **G8194 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, affecting left non-dominant side):** The chief complaint is \"Left arm weakness,\" and the HPI further details \"left sided weakness,\" being \"unable to lift her left arm,\" \"unable to pick up her coffee mug with her left hand/arm,\" and her \"left foot (but not more proximal leg) felt 'dead' like 'lead'.\" The patient is described as right-handed, making the left side her non-dominant side. This clinical presentation clearly indicates hemiplegia or significant hemiparesis on the left side.\n",
      "5.  **R4781 (Slurred speech):** The chief complaint includes \"speech difficulty,\" and the HPI explicitly states she \"noticed that her speech was slurred.\"\n",
      "6.  **E7800 (Pure hypercholesterolemia, unspecified):** Although not explicitly detailed in the provided HPI excerpt, hypercholesterolemia is a very common comorbidity and a significant risk factor for cerebrovascular events like TIAs and strokes. It is highly probable that this was identified in the patient's past medical history or during the initial workup for the \"CODE STROKE,\" even if not elaborated upon in this specific HPI section.\n",
      "7.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Similar to E7800, psychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder are common and can be comorbid with substance use disorders or chronic health issues. This code likely reflects a diagnosis from the patient's past medical history that is not explicitly detailed in the provided HPI excerpt.\n",
      "8.  **I671 (Cerebral aneurysm, nonruptured):** This condition is not mentioned in the HPI. However, during the comprehensive workup for a \"CODE STROKE,\" advanced imaging studies (such as CT angiography or MRI) are typically performed. A non-ruptured cerebral aneurysm could be an incidental finding on such imaging, or it might be a known condition from the patient's past medical history that is relevant to her neurological assessment, even if not the acute cause of her current symptoms.\n",
      "9.  **Z823 (Family history of stroke):** Obtaining a comprehensive family history is a standard part of a medical evaluation, particularly for conditions like stroke, where genetic predispositions can play a role. This code indicates that a family history of stroke was documented, likely obtained during the full patient intake process, even though it is not explicitly stated in the provided HPI excerpt.\n",
      "10. **F1111 (Opioid abuse with intoxication, delirium):** The provided HPI specifically mentions \"alcohol and tobacco use disorder\" but does not explicitly state opioid use or abuse. However, the term \"use disorder\" can be broad. If this code was assigned, it suggests that a more comprehensive history, toxicology screening, or other clinical findings not detailed in this specific HPI excerpt revealed opioid abuse with intoxication and delirium. The \"unresponsive\" state during one TIA episode might have been considered in a differential diagnosis or context involving substance use, though no direct evidence for opioids is in this HPI.\n",
      "11. **Z716 (Encounter for health supervision for high-risk sexual behavior):** This code is highly specific and has no direct or indirect textual support within the provided HPI excerpt. There is no mention of sexual behavior, high-risk activities, or related health supervision. If this code was assigned, it must be based on information from another part of the patient's medical record (e.g., a specific health risk assessment, counseling session, or social history) that is not included in this provided HPI.\n",

A left-sided stroke typically causes right-sided weakness.\n",
      "3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient's \"past medical history of ... hyperlipidemia\" is the direct reason for this code.\n",
      "4.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The patient's \"past medical history of ... anxiety and depression\" supports this code for anxiety.\n",
      "5.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The patient's \"past medical history of ... anxiety and depression\" supports this code for depression.\n",
      "6.  **W1830XA (Fall on same level, unspecified, initial encounter):** The description \"Patient was walking from her bedroom to the bathroom and tripped over her right foot and fell on her right leg\" indicates a fall on the same level.

      "7.  **Y92003 (Unspecified place of occurrence, bathroom of single-family house):** The detail \"walking from her bedroom to the bathroom\" identifies the place of occurrence as a bathroom within a home setting.\n",
      "8.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** While not explicitly stated in the provided HPI, a significant fracture like a tibial plateau fracture, especially one requiring surgical repair (ORIF), can lead to acute blood loss and subsequent acute posthemorrhagic anemia. This is a common complication in trauma and surgical settings.\n",
      "9.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** This information is not present in the provided HPI. However, it is a common comorbidity often documented in a patient's comprehensive medical history or social history, even if not directly relevant to the current chief complaint or immediate admission. For the purpose of explaining the code, we assume it's part of her documented medical history.\n",
      "10. **M1990 (Unspecified arthropathy, unspecified site):** A tibial plateau fracture is an injury to the bone that forms part of the knee joint. \"Arthropathy\" refers to joint disease. This code might be assigned to broadly cover the joint involvement from the severe fracture, or potential underlying joint issues that contributed to the fall, or general joint health considerations in an orthopedic context, even if more specific codes for the fracture are also present.\n",
      "11. **Z23 (Encounter for immunization):** This code is for an encounter where an immunization was administered. While not mentioned in the HPI, it is plausible that a patient admitted for trauma or surgery might receive routine immunizations (e.g., tetanus, influenza) during their hospital stay as part of standard care.\n",

      "2.  **C772 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of intra-abdominal lymph nodes):** While the CT scan indicated no evidence of metastatic disease *preoperatively*, for an adenocarcinoma of the colon that undergoes colectomy, regional lymph node involvement (which would be considered a \"secondary malignant neoplasm\" in that region for staging purposes) is common and would be identified during the pathological examination of the resected specimen. The presence of this code implies that the final pathology report likely confirmed involvement of intra-abdominal lymph nodes, even if not evident on initial imaging.\n",
      "3.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** Although not directly stated in the HPI, patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (like hyperlipidemia and hypertension, evidenced by the allergy list) often have Type 2 Diabetes. The presence of the code Z794 (long-term use of insulin) further confirms that the patient has diabetes requiring insulin, and Type 2 Diabetes is the most common form requiring insulin in adults.\n",
      "4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The allergy list includes \"Niaspan ER / lovastatin / Simvostatin,\" all of which are medications (niacin and statins) primarily used to treat hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia. This strongly supports the diagnosis.\n",
      "5.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, uncomplicated, continuous use):** While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, nicotine dependence is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with cancer (like colon adenocarcinoma, though less directly linked than lung cancer) and cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia). The presence of the code indicates this was a diagnosed condition.\n",
      "6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The allergy list includes \"amlodipine,\" which is a common medication used to treat hypertension. This strongly suggests the patient has a diagnosis of essential hypertension.\n",

This code reflects the chronic, underlying condition of the native coronary arteries. While the patient is experiencing angina, this code often describes the structural disease of native arteries.\n",

      "7.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated, current):** Smoking is a significant risk factor for coronary artery disease and often contributes to the need for CABG. This code implies a current or recent history of smoking, which is a common comorbidity in patients with this cardiac history.\n",
      "8.  **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** COPD is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with a history of smoking (implied by F17210) and cardiovascular disease, even if not the primary focus of the current presentation.

      "1.  **C01 (Malignant neoplasm of base of tongue):** The chief complaint is \"neck cancer,\" and the history of present illness mentions an \"R neck mass.\" The major surgical procedure, \"robotic hemiglossectomy\" (surgical removal of part of the tongue), directly indicates the tongue as the primary site of the malignancy. The base of the tongue is a common location for such cancers, especially those associated with \"HPV+,\" as noted in the HPI.\n",
      "2.  **D3705 (Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of other and unspecified major salivary glands):** The \"R neck mass\" mentioned in the HPI could involve or be adjacent to major salivary glands in the neck. During the diagnostic workup or surgical exploration, a separate lesion or a component of the mass might have been identified within a salivary gland with characteristics that were not definitively benign or malignant, leading to this classification.\n",
      "3.  **E785 (Mixed hyperlipidemia):** This is a very common chronic metabolic condition. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided chief complaint or history of present illness, it is a frequent comorbidity found in a patient's overall medical history and would typically be managed by their attending physician.\n",
      "4.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Receiving a diagnosis of \"neck cancer\" and undergoing a significant surgical procedure like a hemiglossectomy are major life stressors that very commonly lead to or exacerbate anxiety. This is a plausible psychological comorbidity given the patient's situation.\n",
      "5.  **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric) (unspecified)):** Obstructive sleep apnea is a prevalent chronic condition. While not directly stated, a \"neck mass\" or issues in the oropharyngeal region (such as those leading to a hemiglossectomy) can contribute to or worsen sleep apnea. This is a common comorbidity that might be present in the patient's medical history.\n",
      "6.  **G8918 (Acute pain, not elsewhere classified):** The \"neck cancer\" itself can cause pain. Furthermore, the \"robotic hemiglossectomy\" is a significant surgical procedure that would undoubtedly result in acute postoperative pain, requiring management. This code directly reflects the presence of acute pain in this context.\n",

      "2.  **E1022 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy with end stage renal disease):** The patient has \"hx of T1DM... and CKD.\" Diabetic nephropathy is a common complication of long-standing Type 1 Diabetes and is a cause of Chronic Kidney Disease. The specific stage as \"end stage renal disease\" is an inference that would typically come from the full medical record, but it's a plausible progression for diabetic CKD.\n",
      "3.  **E1043 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy):** The patient's history includes \"T1DM c/b autonomic dysfunction.\" Autonomic dysfunction is a form of diabetic polyneuropathy.\n",
      "4.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** The patient's history states \"HTN, HFpEF and CKD.\" This code comprehensively covers the comorbidity of hypertension affecting both the heart (with heart failure) and the kidneys (chronic kidney disease).\n",
      "5.  **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** The patient's history includes \"HFpEF\" (Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction), which is synonymous with chronic diastolic heart failure.\n",
      "6.  **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** The patient has a clear history of \"CKD.\"\n",
      "7.  **R51 (Headache):** The \"History of Present Illness\" notes a \"recent admission for headache.\"\n",
      "8.  **G960 (Cerebrospinal fluid leak):** The medical record states her \"headache was secondary to dural leak from recent epidural spinal injection.\" This directly indicates a CSF leak.\n",
      "9.  **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** The patient presents with \"altered mental status\" and is \"found to be in DKA.\" DKA leads to metabolic encephalopathy, which can be categorized under toxic encephalopathy (due to endogenous metabolic toxins).\n",
      "10. **E861 (Volume depletion):** DKA is characterized by severe dehydration and fluid loss, making volume depletion a expected finding for \"altered mental status found to be in DKA.\"\n",
      "11. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** DKA, along with severe dehydration (E861) and pre-existing CKD (N189, E1022), frequently precipitates acute kidney injury or acute-on-chronic kidney failure.\n",
      "12. **D638 (Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere):** Anemia is a very common comorbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Type 1 Diabetes. While not explicitly stated, it's a highly likely associated condition.\n",
      "13. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, are common in the presentation of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) before insulin treatment.\n",
      "14. **I951 (Orthostatic hypotension):** Given the patient's \"autonomic dysfunction\" secondary to T1DM, orthostatic hypotension is a common manifestation of diabetic autonomic neuropathy.\n",
      "15. **I9589 (Other specified hypotension):** This could be related to volume depletion (E861) from DKA or general circulatory instability from autonomic dysfunction.\n",
      "16. **Z9114 (Patient's noncompliance with other medical treatment and regimen):** While the patient's son states she was \"taking her insult prior to this morning,\" the development of DKA (glucose 555) often suggests a degree of non-adherence to the diabetic regimen (diet, insulin adjustment, sick-day rules) or a failure to adequately manage blood glucose, thus potentially coded as noncompliance.\n",
      "17. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** The patient presented with acute symptoms (\"slurring her speech with some facial droop\") that prompted a \"rapid stroke screen,\" even though it was negative. In a patient with T1DM and HTN, a history of TIA or stroke is common, and these acute symptoms might trigger a review of past medical history where a TIA was diagnosed, even if not explicitly mentioned in this HPI snippet.\n",
      "18. **E10319 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy with macular edema):** This is a common microvascular complication of long-standing Type 1 Diabetes. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI, it is a very plausible condition to be present in the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "19. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Depression is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic illnesses like T1DM, CKD, and HF. It is not mentioned in the HPI but could be part of the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "20. **J4520 (Mild persistent asthma, uncomplicated):** Asthma is not mentioned in the provided medical record. This code would likely come from the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "21. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** GERD is not mentioned in the provided medical record. This code would likely come from the patient's full medical history.\n",

      "2.  **G8194 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, affecting left dominant side)**: The patient's chief complaint is \"Left-sided Weakness and Numbness,\" and the history of present illness details \"worsening left sided weakness, numbness, and confusion,\" \"left foot was dragging,\" \"left arm clumsiness,\" \"difficulty using a fork and knife in her left hand,\" \"left lower extremity weakness,\" and \"sense of heaviness and lack of awareness of her left arm and leg.\" These symptoms are consistent with hemiplegia affecting the left side, which is a common sequela of a right-sided cerebral infarct. While the patient is right-handed (meaning her left side is non-dominant), the code G81.94 refers to left-sided hemiplegia.\n",
      "3.  **H4902 (Third [oculomotor] nerve palsy, left)**: The patient's history includes \"chronic partial L ___ nerve palsy\" and her exam demonstrated \"chronic vertical diplopia on upgaze secondary to her known partial third nerve palsy.\" This directly justifies the code for left third nerve palsy.\n",

      "4.  **S7012XA (Contusion of left thigh, initial encounter):** The patient \"fell forward while climbing steps, striking his head and left leg\" and experienced \"excruciating left leg pain.\" A contusion of the thigh is a likely injury from such an impact. The \"A\" indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "5.  **S36031A (Contusion of left kidney, initial encounter):** The patient \"fell backwards, striking his flank\" two days prior and reported \"bilateral flank pain.\" The decline in Hct (from 24.7 to 22) during work-up suggests an internal injury, and a kidney contusion is a plausible finding given flank trauma. The \"A\" indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "6.  **Z9181 (Personal history of falling):** The patient \"reports a couple of recent falls,\" which necessitates coding a history of falls as a risk factor.\n",
      "7.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** The medical record notes \"his hct was noted to decline from 24.7 to 22,\" which is an acute drop, suggesting acute blood loss likely due to the recent trauma (fall and associated injuries).\n",
      "8.  **D631 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease):** The patient has \"ESRD on HD\" (End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis). Anemia is a common and expected complication of chronic kidney disease.\n",
      "9.  **I132 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 5 chronic kidney disease, or end stage renal disease):** This comprehensive code reflects the patient's \"HTN\" (Hypertension), \"ESRD on HD\" (End Stage Renal Disease), and the presence of underlying heart conditions (\"severe AS s/p TAVR,\" \"CAD\"), which collectively contribute to heart failure.\n",
      "10. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** This code directly corresponds to the patient's \"CAD\" (Coronary Artery Disease).\n",
      "11. **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** This is a common comorbidity with \"CAD\" and can be inferred given the patient's age and extensive cardiac history.\n",

      "16. **I5022 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure) & I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** Patients with \"severe AS,\" \"CAD,\" \"HTN,\" and \"ESRD\" are at high risk for developing both systolic and diastolic heart failure. While not explicitly stated, these are highly probable underlying conditions given the extensive cardiac and renal history.\n",
      "17. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI, COPD is a common chronic condition in older patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, especially if there's a history of smoking (often associated with CAD and ESRD), and can be a significant part of their overall medical burden. It is plausible this was documented in a more complete medical record.\n",
      "18. **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy with end stage renal disease):** This code links the patient's \"IDDM\" (Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, likely Type 2 in this age group) with \"ESRD on HD,\" indicating diabetic nephropathy as a cause or contributor to the kidney disease.\n",
      "19. **E1142 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy):** Diabetic polyneuropathy is a common complication of long-standing \"IDDM\" and can contribute to balance issues and falls.\n",
      "20. **E781 (Pure hypercholesterolemia):** Hypercholesterolemia is a very common comorbidity in patients with \"CAD\" and \"IDDM,\" even if not explicitly stated in the HPI, it's typically managed in such patients.\n",
      "21. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** This is a common electrolyte imbalance in patients with \"ESRD on HD,\" especially in an acute setting or if dialysis is missed or inadequate, or due to other medical stressors.\n",
      "22. **N186 (End stage renal disease):** This code directly corresponds to \"ESRD on HD.\"\n",
      "23. **Z992 (Dependence on renal dialysis):** This code indicates the patient's ongoing need for \"HD\" (Hemodialysis) due to ESRD.\n",
      "24. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** The patient's \"IDDM\" (Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) indicates long-term insulin use.\n",
      "25. **Z45018 (Encounter for adjustment and management of other cardiac device):** \"Cardiology evaluated the pacemaker\" which indicates an encounter for the management or check of the permanent pacemaker (\"s/p PPM\").\n",
      "26. **M898X6 (Other specified disorders of bone, unspecified site):** This general bone disorder code might be assigned to reflect an underlying bone condition (e.g., osteoporosis common in elderly or ESRD patients) that predisposed the patient to the hip fracture, or other bone pain (\"bilateral flank pain\").\n",
      "27. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** While not explicitly stated, a history of nicotine dependence is a very common risk factor for \"CAD,\" \"HTN,\" and \"COPD\" (if J449 is present) in this demographic, and is typically documented in a patient's full medical history.\n",

      "1.  **Chief Complaint \"Foot wound\" and Major Procedure \"Right Lower Extremity Angiogram\":** These are central to several codes related to diabetes and vascular disease in the lower extremities.\n",
      "2.  **E1142 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy) and E11628 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other skin complication):** The \"Foot wound\" in a male patient strongly suggests diabetic foot complications. Diabetic polyneuropathy (E1142) is a common predisposing factor, and the wound itself constitutes a \"skin complication\" (E11628).\n",
      "3.  **I70735 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of right lower limb with ulceration of ankle and foot) and I70738 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of other lower limb with ulceration of ankle and foot):** These codes directly describe severe peripheral artery disease (atherosclerosis) in both lower limbs, with ulceration in the ankle/foot region, aligning perfectly with the \"Foot wound\" and the \"Right Lower Extremity Angiogram\" performed to investigate the vascular supply.\n",
      "4.  **L03115 (Cellulitis of right lower limb):** An infected \"Foot wound\" often leads to cellulitis.\n",
      "5.  **L97514 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of right lower leg with bone necrosis) and L97814 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of other part of right lower limb with bone necrosis):** These codes further specify the nature and severity of the \"Foot wound\" on the right side, indicating it is a chronic, non-pressure ulcer with underlying bone necrosis.\n",
      "6.  **M86171 (Other acute osteomyelitis, right tibia and fibula):** The bone necrosis mentioned in L97514/L97814 strongly points to osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone, common in deep diabetic foot ulcers.\n",
      "7.  **Z89411 (Acquired absence of right great toe) and Z89421 (Acquired absence of right lesser toe(s)):** These indicate previous amputations of toes on the right foot, which is a common sequela of severe diabetic foot disease and peripheral artery disease, providing a history context for the current severe foot wound.\n",
      "8.  **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** Directly linked to the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes (E11.xx).\n",
      "9.  **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease) and N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** These codes indicate chronic kidney disease, a frequent comorbidity with long-standing diabetes and hypertension (implied by the Lisinopril allergy).\n",
      "10. **D631 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease):** Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease.\n",
      "11. **Z940 (Kidney transplant status):** This crucial code explains the presence of chronic kidney disease in the context of a prior kidney transplant.\n",
      "12. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a common comorbidity for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "13. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris) and Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** These indicate underlying coronary artery disease and a history of prior bypass surgery, commonly associated with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\n",
      "14. **I482 (Permanent atrial fibrillation):** A common arrhythmia in patients with underlying heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes.\n",
      "15. **I5023 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, severe):** A common severe complication of long-standing hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n",
      "16. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** This is often indicated for conditions like atrial fibrillation (I482) or significant peripheral artery disease to prevent clot formation.\n",
      "17. **T82858A (Stenosis of other cardiac and vascular prosth/graft, initial encounter):** This code suggests a complication of a previous vascular surgery, possibly a bypass graft in the lower extremity or elsewhere, now experiencing stenosis. The \"A\" denotes an initial encounter for this complication.\n",
      "18. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** A common comorbidity often seen in patients with multiple chronic conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "19. **Z8551 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of colon) and Z85828 (Personal history of other secondary malignant neoplasm):** These are part of the patient's past medical history of cancer, distinct from the current presentation but relevant to overall health status.\n",

      "1.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** The medical record explicitly states a \"past medical history of Afib (now SR s/p ablation).\" This directly supports the coding for atrial fibrillation, even though it is currently in sinus rhythm due to ablation.\n",
      "2.  **K50012 (Crohn's disease of small intestine with intestinal obstruction, with perforation):** The HPI states \"longstanding Crohn's disease complicated by stricturing with recurrent small bowel obstructions.\" This accounts for Crohn's disease of the small intestine with intestinal obstruction. While \"with perforation\" is not explicitly mentioned as a *current* event in this HPI snippet, perforation is a known severe complication of Crohn's disease with strictures and obstructions. Its inclusion suggests it may have been identified through imaging, surgical findings (not detailed here), or represents a history of perforation associated with past obstructions.\n",
      "3.  **K50014 (Crohn's disease of small intestine with fistula, with obstruction):** The HPI mentions \"longstanding Crohn's disease complicated by stricturing with recurrent small bowel obstructions\" and \"He has a history of colovesicular fistula as well.\" This directly supports Crohn's disease of the small intestine with both fistula and obstruction.\n",
      "4.  **J690 (Pneumonitis due to food and vomit):** The patient experienced \"subsequent episodes of bilious and feculent emesis.\" Emesis, especially feculent and in a patient with bowel obstruction, carries a significant risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonitis. This is a plausible acute complication to code given the symptoms.\n",
      "5.  **Z8546 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of prostate):** The HPI clearly states \"past medical history of ... prostate cancer s/p radical prostatectomy.\" This directly supports the code for a personal history of prostate cancer.\n",
      "6.  **I071 (Tricuspid insufficiency, nonrheumatic):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. However, it can be a chronic cardiovascular comorbidity, sometimes associated with conditions like pulmonary hypertension or other chronic heart conditions. Its presence in the code list implies it was part of the patient's documented medical history.\n",
      "7.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is a very common chronic medical condition. While not explicitly stated in this HPI snippet (which focuses on the acute presentation), it is frequently found in a patient's full medical history. Its inclusion suggests it was documented elsewhere in the patient's chart.\n",
      "8.  **I272 (Other secondary pulmonary hypertension):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. Pulmonary hypertension can develop secondary to various cardiac or pulmonary issues. Its presence in the code list indicates it was a documented condition in the patient's overall medical history.\n",
      "9.  **I5031 (Acute diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. However, acute heart failure can be an acute complication in patients with a history of Afib (as this patient has) or in the context of severe illness like a bowel obstruction. Its presence in the code list implies it was either diagnosed during the current admission or was a documented acute issue.\n",
      "10. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order):** This is a patient status code indicating a DNR order. It is not a clinical diagnosis and would not typically be found in the History of Present Illness. Its presence indicates that this patient's advance directive status was documented in their medical record.\n",
      "11. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. A personal history of TIA or stroke is a common finding in elderly patients, especially those with cardiovascular risk factors like Afib. Its presence suggests it was documented in the patient's complete medical history.\n",

      "2.  **F410 (Panic disorder without agoraphobia):** The chief complaint includes \"panic attacks.\" The HPI details \"intermittent panic attacks which became more frequent and disturbing to her and her family, with sensations of impending doom.\" This description aligns with the diagnostic criteria for a panic disorder.\n",
      "3.  **K5190 (Ulcerative colitis, unspecified, without complications):** The HPI explicitly states that the patient has \"ulcerative colitis.\" This code identifies the chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\n",
      "4.  **Z85818 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of skin):** The HPI mentions the patient's \"pT2N2a stage ___ adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left submandibular gland s/p complete surgical resection and completed adjuvant chemoradiation.\" This code documents the patient's personal history of this specific malignancy. While adenoid cystic carcinoma of the submandibular gland is a head and neck malignancy (salivary gland) rather than a skin malignancy, Z85.818 was assigned to reflect the history of the cancer itself.\n",
      "5.  **D539 (Nutritional anemia, unspecified):** The patient experienced \"incessant N/V, unable to take PO\" and had difficulty swallowing due to throat pain for some time. Prolonged inability to maintain adequate oral intake can lead to nutritional deficiencies, including anemia. This code is assigned based on the potential for such deficiency given the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "6.  **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** The HPI notes \"increased restlessness.\" While not explicitly stated as insomnia, severe restlessness can significantly impair sleep onset and maintenance, leading to insomnia. This code is assigned to capture this sleep disturbance potentially linked to her overall condition, medication effects, or anxiety.\n",
      "7.  **K760 (Fatty (change of) liver, not elsewhere classified):** This code is not directly supported by any explicit mention of fatty liver in the provided history. However, it can be a comorbidity associated with chronic illness, nutritional issues, or medication use. Its assignment implies a diagnosis from other parts of the medical record not included in this excerpt or a known comorbidity.\n",

      "2.  **C7801 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung, right) & C7802 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung, left):** \"Metastatic pancreatic cancer\" indicates the cancer has spread from its primary site. The lungs are a common site for metastasis, and these codes together denote secondary malignant neoplasms in both lungs.\n",
      "3.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** The patient's history includes \"hypothyroidism,\" directly supporting this code.\n",
      "4.  **E46 (Unspecified protein-calorie malnutrition):** The patient is described as \"becoming progressively weaker due to poor oral intake,\" which, combined with advanced cancer, strongly suggests malnutrition.\n",
      "5.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** While not explicitly detailed in the HPI snippet, this code would be assigned based on the patient's Body Mass Index (BMI) from a full medical assessment. A patient can have a history of obesity or still be classified as obese even while experiencing weight loss due to illness.\n",
      "6.  **E860 (Dehydration):** \"Poor oral intake\" and feeling \"lightheaded when she goes to stand\" are classic signs of dehydration.\n",
      "7.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The patient's history includes \"depression,\" supporting this code.\n",
      "8.  **J398 (Other specified diseases of upper respiratory tract):** The symptoms of \"nasal congestion\" and \"cough\" fall under this category, indicating an upper respiratory issue.\n",
      "9.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** The patient's history includes \"asthma,\" directly supporting this code.\n",
      "10. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient \"endorses nausea and one episode of vomiting.\" While these symptoms can have multiple causes, GERD is a common gastrointestinal condition that presents with nausea and vomiting and is a plausible co-diagnosis.\n",
      "11. **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** Feeling \"lightheaded when she goes to stand\" can be a symptom of orthostatic hypotension, which often involves reflex tachycardia. This is an inferred physiological response.\n",
      "12. **R0600 (Dyspnea, unspecified):** The \"cough\" and underlying metastatic lung cancer contribute to potential respiratory distress or difficulty breathing, which aligns with dyspnea.\n",
      "13. **R110 (Nausea with vomiting):** Directly corresponds to the patient's reported \"nausea and one episode of vomiting.\"\n",
      "14. **R5383 (Other fatigue):** The chief complaint explicitly includes \"fatigue,\" directly supporting this code.\n",
      "15. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** Given the patient's diagnosis of \"metastatic pancreatic cancer\" and not currently undergoing active chemotherapy, it is highly probable that a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order is in place as part of end-of-life planning, which is a common part of a comprehensive medical record.\n",
      "16. **Z6829 (Body mass index (BMI) 29.0-29.9, adult):** This code indicates a specific BMI range classifying the patient as overweight or obese. It's an objective measurement from a full assessment, similar to E669, and would be part of the patient's overall health profile.\n",

      "7.  **T504X5A (Adverse effect of other pyrazolone derivatives, not specified as to intent, initial encounter)**: 病史提到 \"diabetic nephropathy was worsened by large ibuprofen doses\" (因大量布洛芬導致糖尿病腎病變惡化)。布洛芬屬於非類固醇消炎止痛藥 (NSAIDs)，可歸類為\"其他吡唑酮衍生物\"或其他抗風濕藥物的副作用。\n",
      "8.  **Y92009 (Unspecified place of occurrence, unspecified)**: 與T504X5A (藥物不良反應) 相關，由於病史中未明確指出患者服用布洛芬的具體地點，因此使用此未指定地點代碼。\n",
      "9.  **E875 (Hyperkalemia)**: 病史提到患者因 \"hyperkalemia\" (高血鉀) 需要緊急透析，且實驗室檢查顯示 \"K 6.9\"。\n",
      "10. **E861 (Volume depletion)**: 儘管患者有體液過量症狀 (水腫、肺部濕羅音)，但 \"intradialytic hypotension\" (透析中低血壓) 通常是由於透析過程中體液清除過快導致的血管內容量不足（即相對性體液不足/脫水）。\n",
      "11. **D631 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease)**: 實驗室檢查顯示血紅蛋白 \"10.1\" (貧血)，這是末期腎臟病患者常見的併發症。\n",
      "12. **R001 (Bradycardia, unspecified)**: 病史中描述 \"Staff could not palpate a pulse and began CPR\" (醫護人員摸不到脈搏並開始心肺復甦術)，這暗示了嚴重的緩脈或心臟驟停，R001可用於描述這種情況。\n",
      "13. **I5189 (Other ill-defined heart diseases)**: 心電圖 (EKG) 顯示 \"ST depressions V4-6\" (ST段下降V4-6導程)，表示心肌缺血或心臟負荷過重，此代碼可用於描述不明確的心臟疾病。\n",
      "14. **R7989 (Other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry)**: 實驗室檢查顯示 \"lactate 3.0\"，這是一種異常的血液化學結果，可能與休克或組織灌流不足有關。\n",
      "15. **R0789 (Other chest pain)**: 患者主訴有 \"vague chest pain that he describes as MSK pain from compression\" (模糊的胸痛，描述為因壓迫引起的肌肉骨骼疼痛)。\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **C434 (Malignant melanoma of scalp and neck):** The medical record states the patient has \"metastatic melanoma.\" This code likely represents the primary site of the melanoma, established in the patient's past medical history, even if not explicitly detailed in this specific HPI excerpt.\n",
      "2.  **C770 (Secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes of head, face, and neck):** As the patient has \"metastatic melanoma,\" this code indicates metastasis to regional lymph nodes in the head/neck area, which is a common spread pattern for melanoma, especially if the primary site (C434) is in this region.\n",
      "3.  **C772 (Secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of intra-abdominal lymph nodes):** Given the patient's \"metastatic melanoma\" and presenting chief complaint of \"abdominal pain,\" this code signifies metastasis to lymph nodes located within the abdomen, directly correlating with the abdominal symptoms and widespread disease.\n",
      "4.  **C7801 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of right lung):** The patient has \"metastatic melanoma.\" Melanoma commonly metastasizes to the lungs, and this code specifies involvement of the right lung.\n",
      "5.  **C7802 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of left lung):** Similar to C7801, this code indicates metastasis to the left lung, suggesting bilateral lung involvement or distinct metastatic lesions.\n",
      "6.  **C787 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile duct):** The patient has \"metastatic melanoma,\" \"abdominal pain,\" and a \"rising LDH to 904.\" Liver metastasis is a frequent site of spread for melanoma and can cause abdominal symptoms and elevated liver enzymes or markers like LDH.\n",
      "7.  **C7931 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of brain):** \"Metastatic melanoma\" has a high propensity to spread to the brain. While not an explicit new diagnosis in the HPI, \"intermittent dizziness\" and a \"fall one week ago\" could be subtle indicators of neurological involvement, likely part of her known metastatic disease.\n",
      "8.  **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone):** Bone metastasis is another common site for advanced melanoma, and this code reflects its presence.\n",
      "9.  **C7989 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of other specified sites):** This general code is used to capture metastasis to other sites not specifically covered by more precise codes, indicating the widespread nature of the \"metastatic melanoma.\"\n",
      "10. **E069 (Thyroiditis, unspecified):** This diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI. Therefore, it is presumed to be a pre-existing condition from the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "11. **E860 (Dehydration):** The patient reports \"poor appetite and has not had good PO intake\" and \"lots of dry heaving.\" She \"was given 1L NS\" for fluid replenishment, all directly supporting a diagnosis of dehydration.\n",
      "12. **E871 (Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, electrolyte imbalances, including hyponatremia, are common in patients experiencing poor oral intake, vomiting, and advanced illness. This would likely have been identified through laboratory tests (e.g., \"Labs were unremarkable except for rising LDH\" implies other labs were checked).\n",
      "13. **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The patient's acute and recurring severe abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and the overall context of advanced metastatic cancer and hospice care are significant stressors that commonly trigger or exacerbate anxiety. This is a plausible comorbidity.\n",
      "14. **F845 (Asperger's syndrome):** This diagnosis is not mentioned in the provided HPI. It is presumed to be a pre-existing condition from the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "15. **G893 (Neoplasm related pain (acute) (chronic)):** The patient's chief complaint of \"abdominal pain,\" \"generalized diffuse abdominal discomfort over the past several weeks,\" and her use of \"fentanyl patch with standing Tylenol as well as occasional morphine\" clearly indicate significant pain directly related to her metastatic cancer.\n",
      "16. **J690 (Pneumonitis due to food and vomit):** The patient experienced \"one episode of green non-bloody vomiting\" and \"lots of dry heaving.\" In a frail patient with poor intake and advanced illness, aspiration leading to pneumonitis is a significant risk, especially with repeated emesis.\n",
      "17. **J9690 (Respiratory failure, unspecified, not elsewhere classified):** While current vitals (O2 sat 98%, RR 16) appear stable, a patient with advanced metastatic cancer (especially with lung metastases), fever, and severe symptoms like vomiting and fatigue, is at high risk for or may have experienced transient or underlying respiratory compromise, leading to a diagnostic concern for respiratory failure.\n",
      "18. **K5903 (Chronic constipation, unspecified):** The patient is on \"fentanyl patch\" and \"morphine\" for pain. Opioid-induced constipation is a very common and often chronic side effect of long-term opioid use, even if \"intermittent diarrhea\" is also present due to chemotherapy.\n",
      "19. **K7290 (Unspecified hepatic failure, not induced by alcohol):** The \"rising LDH to 904\" and the presence of liver metastases (C787) indicate significant liver dysfunction, which could progress to or represent an early stage of hepatic failure.\n",
      "20. **R112 (Nausea with vomiting, unspecified):** This code directly reflects the patient's chief complaint of \"Nausea/Vomiting\" and the described symptoms: \"one episode of green non-bloody vomiting\" and \"lots of dry heaving.\"\n",
      "21. **R188 (Other ascites):** Given the \"abdominal pain\" and widespread \"metastatic melanoma\" (specifically to intra-abdominal lymph nodes C772 and liver C787), ascites is a very common complication that causes abdominal distension and pain in advanced cancer.\n",
      "22. **R339 (Unspecified retention of urine):** This diagnosis is not mentioned in the provided HPI. It is presumed to be a pre-existing condition or an acute issue that arose during the hospital stay but was not detailed in this excerpt.\n",
      "23. **R5081 (Fever present):** The patient reported \"fever to 102.1 last night with chills\" and noted \"intermittent fevers for several weeks.\"\n",
      "24. **T402X5A (Adverse effect of other opioids, initial encounter):** The patient is using a \"fentanyl patch\" and \"occasional morphine.\" Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and constipation are common adverse effects of opioids, contributing to her presenting symptoms. The 'A' indicates an initial encounter for treating this adverse effect.\n",
      "25. **T451X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter):** The patient's \"intermittent diarrhea thought to be likely secondary to chemotherapy\" and the mention of \"side effects from chemotherapy\" directly support this code. The 'A' indicates an initial encounter for treating this adverse effect.\n",
      "26. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The acute events (abdominal pain, vomiting) occurred in various locations within the medical facility (clinic, lobby, elevator), which are collectively coded as an unspecified place of occurrence when a more specific Y92 code is not utilized.\n",
      "27. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** The HPI explicitly states, \"She was seen by Palliative Care.\"\n",
      "28. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order [DNR]):** This order is not mentioned in the provided HPI. It is presumed to be part of the patient's advance directives or past medical history.\n",

Its assignment indicates that the patient has a documented history of unspecified hypothyroidism, which is part of their overall medical record.\n",
      "3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The \"Allergies\" section lists \"Statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors / Lescol.\" Statins are a class of drugs primarily used to treat hyperlipidemia. Therefore, an allergy to statins strongly implies that the patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which these medications would have been prescribed or considered.\n",

However, given the constellation of severe, chronic, progressive conditions (severe PAH, HFpEF, permanent AFib, history of hospitalizations, myelodysplastic syndrome), it is highly likely that the patient is receiving or has been evaluated for palliative care services to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. The code indicates this status.\n",

She presented with an acute exacerbation of volume overload, dyspnea, and hypoxia, requiring oxygen dependency. Her care plan includes long-term anticoagulation and likely palliative care, possibly with a DNR status.\n",

      "1.  **G93.5 (Compression of brain):** The History of Present Illness (HPI) states, \"Spine MRI demonstrated a Chiari I type malformation with approximately 2cm tonsillar herniation and compression of the pontomedullary junction at C1 and the occiput.\" This code directly reflects the neurological compression described.\n",
      "2.  **M51.26 (Other intervertebral disc displacement, lumbar region with myelopathy):** The patient presented with \"shoulder and neck pain/pressure that has been going on for a year and a half. Upon initial examination patient describes the pain/pressure going down to the left arm as well as chest numbness.\" These symptoms are consistent with radiculopathy or myelopathy. While the HPI focuses on Chiari malformation causing cervical compression, the presence of M51.26, which specifies *lumbar* disc displacement with myelopathy, indicates that the patient's complete medical record likely includes a diagnosis of a lumbar spinal issue contributing to myelopathic symptoms, even if not explicitly detailed in this Chiari-focused HPI.\n",
      "3.  **I44.1 (Atrioventricular block, second degree):** There is no information in the provided HPI or chief complaint regarding any cardiac issues, symptoms, or diagnoses. This code represents a significant cardiac comorbidity from the patient's past medical history, not related to the current presentation.\n",
      "4.  **R03.0 (Elevated blood pressure reading, without diagnosis of hypertension):** There is no information about blood pressure in the provided HPI. This code likely reflects an elevated blood pressure reading obtained during routine vital sign assessment that does not yet warrant a formal diagnosis of hypertension or is a transient finding.\n",
      "5.  **B19.20 (Unspecified viral hepatitis C without hepatic coma):** There is no information in the provided HPI suggesting a history of hepatitis. This code indicates a pre-existing chronic infectious disease (Hepatitis C) that is a known comorbidity for the patient.\n",
      "6.  **E55.9 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified):** There is no information in the provided HPI about nutritional deficiencies. This code indicates a common nutritional deficiency, likely identified through routine laboratory screening as a comorbidity.\n",
      "7.  **F11.11 (Opioid abuse, in remission):** There is no information in the provided HPI about substance abuse. This code indicates a history of opioid substance use disorder that is currently in remission, representing a past psychiatric/substance use comorbidity.\n",
      "8.  **F14.11 (Cocaine abuse, in remission):** Similar to F11.11, there is no information in the provided HPI about substance abuse. This code indicates a history of cocaine substance use disorder that is currently in remission, representing another past psychiatric/substance use comorbidity.\n",
      "9.  **F17.290 (Nicotine dependence, unspecified, complicated):** There is no explicit mention of nicotine use in the provided HPI. However, nicotine dependence is a very common comorbidity, and this code indicates a history of nicotine use, possibly with associated health \"complications\" that are not further specified in this limited HPI.\n",

      "Summary: The patient's primary diagnosis is Chiari I Malformation with brainstem compression (G93.5), leading to neurological symptoms. Additionally, the patient has several significant comorbidities including a suspected lumbar disc issue with myelopathy (M51.26), cardiac rhythm disorder (I44.1), viral hepatitis C (B19.20), vitamin D deficiency (E55.9), a history of opioid and cocaine abuse in remission (F11.11, F14.11), nicotine dependence (F17.290), and an elevated blood pressure reading (R03.0).\n",

D5700 specifically codes for sickle-cell anemia with crisis, unspecified type.\n",
      "2.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, the patient's attempt to \"self-treat with some wine\" for pain, and the fact he \"hasn't had this [oxycodone] for about ___ months\" despite having chronic pain, could be suggestive of maladaptive coping mechanisms or potential issues with medication adherence that are sometimes associated with underlying mood disorders like depression. This is an inferential leap, as direct evidence is not in the provided text.\n",
      "3.  **G40109 (Localization-related (focal) (partial) symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with simple partial seizures, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** The patient's \"PMH of ... seizure disorder\" is the direct reason for this code.

      "1.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** This code indicates a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. While not explicitly stated in the chief complaint or the very limited history of present illness (which is blank), it is a common chronic endocrine condition often managed in a medicine service. Its inclusion in the patient's ICD-10 list implies it is a documented part of the patient's past medical history or active problem list.\n",
      "2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This code indicates a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. Similar to hypothyroidism, it's a widespread chronic metabolic condition. Its presence in the ICD-10 codes suggests it is a documented, ongoing condition in the patient's medical history.\n",
      "3.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This code indicates a diagnosis of essential (primary) hypertension. This is another very common chronic cardiovascular condition. Its inclusion in the patient's ICD-10 list signifies it is a documented, ongoing condition in the patient's medical history.\n",
      "4.  **R942 (Abnormal results of pulmonary function studies):** This code indicates that pulmonary function studies (PFTs) were performed and yielded abnormal results. Given the \"incidentally identified PE\" and the \"personal history of other malignant neoplasm of lung\" (Z85048), it is plausible that these abnormalities are related to either a pre-existing lung condition, sequelae from the prior lung neoplasm, or findings from investigations related to the pulmonary embolism.\n",
      "5.  **Z85048 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of lung):** This code signifies that the patient has a personal history of lung cancer, meaning they had it in the past and it is currently resolved or in remission. This is a significant piece of the patient's past medical history, particularly relevant as a risk factor for conditions like pulmonary embolism (cancer can create a hypercoagulable state).\n",

      "2.  **External Cause of Injury and Place of Occurrence:**\n",
      "    *   \"mechanical fall (slip on ice)\" directly leads to **W000XXA** (Fall on same level due to ice and snow, initial encounter).\n",
      "    *   \"transferred from ___ ___\" (another facility) supports **Y92093** (Other hospital or healthcare facility as the place of occurrence of the external cause).\n",
      "3.  **Injuries Sustained from Fall (Initial Encounter):**\n",
      "    *   \"right femoral fracture\" and \"right distal femoral condylar fracture\" leads to **S72431A** (Nondisplaced supracondylar fracture of right femur, initial encounter for closed fracture), as supracondylar is a distal femoral fracture.\n",
      "    *   \"multiple left malleolus fractures\" and \"left bimalleolar fracture\" leads to **S8262XA** (Displaced bimalleolar fracture of left lower leg, initial encounter for closed fracture).\n",
      "    *   **S8255XA** (Nondisplaced fracture of medial malleolus of right tibia, initial encounter for closed fracture): The provided HPI only mentions *left* malleolus fractures. This code suggests an additional *right* medial malleolus fracture, which is not explicitly stated in this summary of the medical record. However, as the code was assigned, it implies this fracture was present.\n",
      "4.  **Chronic/Pre-existing Orthopedic Conditions and Status:**\n",
      "    *   **M9711XA** (Periprosthetic fracture around internal prosthetic right hip joint, initial encounter for fracture): The HPI mentions \"right femoral fracture\" and \"right distal femoral condylar fracture likely chronic postsurgical\". Given the presence of Z96651 (right artificial knee joint), a fracture around a prosthesis is implied. M9711XA specifies a periprosthetic fracture of the *hip*. This implies the \"right femoral fracture\" was either high enough to be considered a hip periprosthetic fracture or the patient has both hip and knee prostheses.\n",
      "    *   **Z96651** (Presence of right artificial knee joint): Implied by \"right distal femoral condylar fracture likely chronic postsurgical\" and the application of a \"Right knee brace\", suggesting a pre-existing knee replacement.\n",
      "    *   **Z9861** (Postprocedural status, follow-up after orthopedic cast/brace): The patient received a \"LLE short leg cast\" and \"Right knee brace also applied\" with a recommendation for \"follow up in orthopedics clinic\", indicating a post-procedural status with orthopedic appliances.\n",
      "5.  **Cardiac History:**\n",
      "    *   \"PMHx notable for afib\" leads to **I480** (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) and **I4892** (Unspecified atrial fibrillation).\n",
      "    *   \"PMHx notable for HFrEF\" (Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction) is supported by:\n",
      "        *   **I255** (Ischemic cardiomyopathy), suggesting an ischemic cause for the heart failure.\n",
      "        *   **I5022** (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, severe), specifying the type and severity of heart failure.\n",
      "    *   **I2510** (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris): A common comorbidity with HFrEF and afib.\n",
      "    *   **Z951** (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft): A common finding in patients with ischemic heart disease and HFrEF, implying a past surgical intervention for coronary artery disease.\n",
      "    *   **Z7901** (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants): Highly probable due to \"afib\" to prevent stroke.\n",
      "6.  **Other Past Medical History/Comorbidities:**\n",
      "    *   **E039** (Hypothyroidism, unspecified): A common comorbidity in elderly patients.\n",
      "    *   **D539** (Nutritional anemia, unspecified): A common comorbidity, especially in elderly or chronically ill patients.\n",
      "    *   **D696** (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified): Could be an incidental lab finding or related to other chronic conditions.\n",

      "1.  **N186 (End stage renal disease) & Z992 (Dependence on renal dialysis):** The patient's \"complicated PMH including ESRD (on HD)\" directly maps to these codes, indicating end-stage kidney failure and the ongoing need for hemodialysis.\n",
      "2.  **I120 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with end stage renal disease):** This code combines the patient's ESRD with hypertension, a common cause or comorbidity of kidney disease, which is inherent in the \"complicated PMH\" context for ESRD.\n",
      "3.  **Z87440 (Personal history of other diseases of urinary system):** Given the patient's ESRD, a history of other urinary system diseases is implied, encompassing the progression to ESRD.\n",
      "4.  **E1121 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy):** The patient's \"IDDM\" (Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, commonly used for Type 2 in adults) along with \"ESRD\" strongly suggests diabetic nephropathy as a complication.\n",
      "5.  **E11319 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy):** As a patient with \"IDDM,\" diabetic retinopathy is a very common microvascular complication, even if not explicitly detailed in this specific encounter's HPI.\n",
      "6.  **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic neuropathy):** Similarly, diabetic neuropathy is a frequent complication of long-standing diabetes (\"IDDM\"), affecting various systems including the peripheral nerves and potentially the bladder (see N319).\n",
      "7.  **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** The diagnosis of \"IDDM\" directly indicates the patient's long-term dependence on insulin for diabetes management.\n",
      "8.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient's \"PMH including CAD\" (Coronary Artery Disease) maps to this. The EKG being \"negative for ischemia\" in the ED supports \"without angina pectoris\" for the current presentation, but the underlying CAD persists.\n",
      "9.  **Z9861 (Postprocedural status, angioplasty of coronary artery):** Given the patient's history of CAD, a prior angioplasty is a common intervention, indicating a historical procedure related to their heart disease.\n",
      "10. **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, moderate):** The patient's \"PMH including CHF\" (Congestive Heart Failure) maps to this, with the specific type and severity (\"chronic diastolic, moderate\") coming from the full patient record.\n",
      "11. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** The \"mild exacerbation of chronic cough\" and the mention of \"Symbicort\" in the allergies (a common COPD medication) strongly indicate a diagnosis of COPD.\n",
      "12. **B349 (Viral infection, unspecified):** The patient presents with general symptoms like \"malaise, abd pain, HA and a T of 101.7,\" \"fever,\" and \"mild exacerbation of chronic cough.\" \"Flu negative\" and normal WBC suggest a non-bacterial cause, making an unspecified viral infection a plausible diagnosis for these acute symptoms.\n",
      "13. **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The note \"pt was lethargic in ED, though had received Ativan\" suggests that Ativan was administered, which is commonly used to treat anxiety. This implies a diagnosis or acute episode of anxiety.\n",
      "14. **E669 (Obesity, unspecified) & Z6833 (Body mass index (BMI) 33.0-33.9, adult):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, obesity (E669) is a common comorbidity for many of this patient's chronic conditions (diabetes, heart failure). Z6833 provides a specific BMI, indicating this was a known measurement in the patient's record.\n",
      "15. **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** Anemia is a very common complication of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), making this a highly probable co-morbidity even if not explicitly mentioned in this HPI snippet.\n",
      "16. **N319 (Neuromuscular dysfunction of bladder, unspecified):** With long-standing diabetes (\"IDDM\"), diabetic neuropathy can affect autonomic functions, including bladder control (neurogenic bladder), making this a plausible comorbidity.\n",
      "17. **L97419 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of other part of left lower leg with unspecified severity):** Chronic ulcers of the lower leg are common complications in patients with long-standing diabetes (diabetic foot) and peripheral vascular disease, which often coexists with CAD.\n",
      "18. **Z89431 (Acquired absence of left toe):** Amputations, such as toe amputation, are common severe complications of diabetic foot disease in patients with long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes.\n",
      "19. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Nicotine dependence is a significant risk factor and common personal history for conditions like CAD, CHF, and COPD, making its presence in the historical record highly likely.\n",
      "20. **J690 (Pneumonitis due to food and vomit):** Although the HPI states \"no nausea/vomiting,\" the patient was \"lethargic in ED, though had received Ativan.\" Altered mental status can increase the risk of silent aspiration. This code might indicate a past event or a concern identified upon full review, despite the current lack of explicit vomiting.\n",

      "*   **G2581 (Restless legs syndrome):** While not explicitly stated, this code might reflect a co-existing neurological or sleep-related disorder, often seen in patients with multiple chronic conditions like COPD and OSA, and might contribute to overall sleep disturbance or fatigue patterns. It's inferred as part of the patient's known medical history not detailed in the HPI excerpt.\n",
      "*   **G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** Despite the patient \"appearing to 'follow asleep' immediately afterwards,\" which might suggest hypersomnia, insomnia (disrupted sleep) can be a comorbidity with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) or other chronic conditions like COPD and RA. This code may represent a general sleep disturbance diagnosis from the patient's medical history.\n",
      "*   **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Directly corresponds to the mention of \"OSA\" in the patient's history.\n",
      "*   **I119 (Hypertensive heart disease without heart failure):** Although current blood pressures are borderline, a history of hypertension is very common in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Myocardial Infarction (MI). This code suggests a long-standing history of hypertension that has affected the heart.\n",
      "*   **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Corresponds to the patient's history of \"CAD\" (Coronary Artery Disease) and \"s/p MI an stents.\" The absence of current chest pain (\"denies chest pain\") supports \"without angina pectoris.\"\n",

      "*   **I4510 (Unspecified heart block):** The history mentions \"telemetry with episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia\" during a previous pre-syncope evaluation. This pattern of alternating fast and slow heart rates is indicative of a cardiac conduction disturbance, which heart block (including sick sinus syndrome variations) falls under.\n",
      "*   **I519 (Heart disease, unspecified):** This is a general code for heart disease, often used to encompass the patient's broader cardiac history including CAD, MI, and Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (pAF), when a more specific single code doesn't capture the full picture.\n",

      "*   **Z7682 (Awaiting organ transplant status):** While not explicitly mentioned, the patient has Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and is on immunosuppressants (prednisone, mycophenolate), suggesting severe lung involvement. It is plausible that the patient is being evaluated for or awaiting a lung transplant, given the severity of their ILD, even if not directly stated in this HPI excerpt.\n",
      "*   **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Directly corresponds to the patient being \"on xarelto\" for a history of \"PE\" (Pulmonary Embolism). Xarelto is an anticoagulant.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **C155 (Malignant neoplasm of esophagus, middle third):** The medical record explicitly states, \"Mr. ___ is a ___ with esophageal adenocarcinoma,\" which is a primary malignant neoplasm of the esophagus. The middle third is a common location for such tumors.\n",
      "2.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** The patient was \"on TPN for nutrition\" and is listed with Z794 (long-term use of insulin). TPN is a known cause of hyperglycemia, often requiring insulin management, indicating either pre-existing Type 2 Diabetes or TPN-induced diabetes with hyperglycemia.\n",
      "3.  **E870 (Hyperosmolality and hypernatremia):** This is a potential metabolic complication that can occur in critically ill patients, especially those on TPN or with complex fluid balance issues, though not explicitly stated, it's a plausible comorbidity in this complex case.\n",
      "4.  **K228 (Other specified diseases of esophagus):** The record mentions \"resection of necrotic anastomosis with recreation of esophagogastric anastomosis\" and \"taken back to the OR for resection of necrotic anastomosis with a leak.\" This directly points to a significant esophageal complication.\n",
      "5.  **K9189 (Other postprocedural complications and disorders of the digestive system, not elsewhere classified):** This code covers the general and specific complications arising from the \"minimally invasive esophagectomy\" and subsequent issues like the \"necrotic anastomosis with a leak.\"\n",
      "6.  **Y832 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of procedure):** The anastomotic leak and necrosis are complications \"due to\" the original esophagectomy, but not necessarily due to an error during the initial procedure itself. This external cause code links the surgery to the later complications.\n",
      "7.  **Z09 (Encounter for follow-up examination after treatment for conditions other than malignant neoplasm):** The patient was \"transf in from rehab for EGD\" and \"s/p EGD and stent replacement.\" This indicates an encounter for follow-up and management of complications (stent, anastomosis) rather than initial treatment for the cancer itself. While the cancer is the root cause, Z09 is often used for follow-up of post-surgical states and complications.\n",
      "8.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Although not explicitly stated, patients with PICC lines and complex surgical histories often require prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation, making this a common and plausible medication.\n",
      "9.  **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** This directly supports the diagnosis of E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia), indicating ongoing insulin therapy.\n",
      "10. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Esophageal adenocarcinoma is strongly associated with smoking. While not explicitly mentioned in this excerpt, a personal history of nicotine dependence is a very common and expected comorbidity for this patient's primary diagnosis.\n",
      "11. **Z9221 (Personal history of total parenteral nutrition (TPN)):** The history states, \"He was on TPN for nutrition and IV abx.\" This is a direct match.\n",
      "12. **Z923 (Personal history of radiation therapy):** Radiation therapy is a common treatment modality for esophageal cancer, either pre-operatively or post-operatively. This indicates a past treatment.\n",
      "13. **Z978 (Presence of other specified devices):** The record mentions \"Right PICC line placement,\" \"left basilic PICC line,\" \"jejunal tube feeds\" (\"laparacospic jejunostomy feeding tube\"), and \"esophageal stent placement,\" all of which are covered by this code.\n",
      "14. **Z98890 (Other specified postprocedural states):** This covers the chronic state of having a \"jejunal tube feeds\" and the overall complex post-surgical status following multiple interventions related to the esophagectomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient is a male with esophageal adenocarcinoma who underwent multiple surgical procedures and experienced severe complications, including anastomotic necrosis and leak, requiring further interventions like stent placement and feeding tube dependence. He is being followed up for these complications and has associated metabolic issues and medical history related to his cancer and treatments.\n",

      "1.  **E1151 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy with ulcer):** The patient has a \"past medical history of type II DM\" and a \"non-healing chronic right toe wound,\" which is a classic diabetic ulcer. The \"claudication of right calf\" and the bypass surgery indicate peripheral angiopathy.\n",
      "2.  **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy):** While not explicitly stated, diabetic foot ulcers, especially chronic and non-healing ones, are very commonly associated with diabetic polyneuropathy, which impairs sensation and contributes to injury and poor healing. This is a highly probable comorbidity in such a case.\n",
      "3.  **E11649 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with neurological complication with unspecified complication):** The patient has a \"past medical history of stroke\" (a neurological event), and diabetes is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. This code could also encompass other unspecified neurological complications related to diabetes, beyond polyneuropathy.\n",
      "4.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a common comorbidity with Type II DM and hypertension, contributing significantly to atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial disease. While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, it is highly likely to be part of the patient's medical profile given the other conditions.\n",
      "5.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** The \"past medical history of tobacco abuse\" directly corresponds to nicotine dependence.\n",
      "6.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The \"past medical history of hypertension\" directly codes to this.\n",
      "7.  **I70235 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of right lower leg with ulceration):** The patient's \"claudication of right calf,\" the \"right toe ulcer,\" and the extensive \"Composite bypass grafting of right femoral to above knee with PTFE graft and right above knee to posterior tibial artery bypass grafting\" for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are all indicative of severe atherosclerosis in the right lower leg arteries, leading to ulceration.\n",
      "8.  **L97519 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of other part of right foot with unspecified severity):** This code specifically describes the \"non-healing chronic right toe wound/ulcer.\" It complements E11.51 by providing more anatomical detail of the ulcer.\n",
      "9.  **M84477A (Traumatic pathological fracture, right ankle and foot, initial encounter for fracture):** The \"MRI which demonstrated a non-displaced comminuted fracture of the distal aspect of the distal phalanx\" (of the right great toe) is coded here. The fracture is in the foot, and \"A\" denotes the initial encounter. It is termed \"pathological\" potentially due to the underlying diabetic condition or osteopenia, making the bone more susceptible to fracture from minor trauma.\n",
      "10. **M869 (Osteomyelitis, unspecified):** The \"purulent discharge\" and the wound being \"concerning for osteomyelitis\" justify this code, even though X-rays and MRI did not demonstrate *overt* osteomyelitis. The clinical suspicion and initiation of \"broad spectrum IV antibiotics\" indicate that osteomyelitis was a serious diagnostic consideration and part of the patient's initial presentation and management.\n",
      "11. **R944 (Abnormal results of function studies of cardiovascular system):** \"ABI's were reportedly ordered, but results are unavailable at this time.\" The fact that ABIs (Ankle-Brachial Index) were ordered due to claudication and PAD symptoms suggests an expectation of abnormal cardiovascular function, even if the specific results are not documented in this snippet.\n",
      "12. **Z720 (Tobacco use):** The \"tobacco abuse\" in the past medical history indicates current tobacco use, distinct from nicotine dependence (F17.210).\n",
      "13. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** For a patient with Type II DM with severe complications like peripheral angiopathy and a non-healing ulcer requiring bypass surgery, long-term insulin use is a very common and often necessary treatment for glycemic control. This is a reasonable inference in the context of severe diabetes management.\n",
      "14. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** The \"past medical history of stroke\" is coded here, specifying a history of cerebral infarction.\n",

      "1.  **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** The medical record explicitly states \"remote hx of breast cancer s/p mastectomy.\" This directly supports the assignment of a personal history code for breast cancer.\n",
      "2.  **J8489 (Other specified interstitial pulmonary diseases):** The patient has an active diagnosis of \"acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia.\" Organizing pneumonia is a recognized form of interstitial lung disease, fitting this code.\n",
      "3.  **G894 (Chronic pain syndrome):** The medical record directly states \"chronic pain syndrome.\"\n",
      "4.  **T424X1A (Poisoning by benzodiazepines, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter):** The patient states, \"I took too much klonopin, and I passed out on the couch.\" Klonopin (clonazepam) is a benzodiazepine. This directly indicates an accidental overdose of a benzodiazepine, and \"A\" denotes an initial encounter for treatment.\n",
      "5.  **F5104 (Psychophysiologic insomnia):** The patient reports \"Chronic insomnia is a major issue for her\" and that she \"was desperate for sleep,\" indicating a chronic sleep disturbance with a psychological or physiological component.\n",
      "6.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The patient's severe insomnia, \"desperate for sleep,\" and evaluation by psychiatry, coupled with the mention of \"psychotropic medications,\" suggest an underlying mood disorder. This code is often assigned in such contexts.\n",
      "7.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Difficulty sleeping and \"desperate for sleep\" can be symptoms of an anxiety disorder, often comorbid with insomnia and depression. The psychiatric evaluation further supports this.\n",
      "8.  **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** The chief complaint of \"AMS\" (Altered Mental Status), the specific \"benzo intoxication,\" and the psychiatry note of \"resolving delirium\" strongly indicate a toxic effect on the brain, consistent with toxic encephalopathy.\n",
      "9.  **Y92009 (Unspecified place of occurrence, not elsewhere classified):** The patient \"fell\" \"from home.\" While more specific codes for \"home\" exist, this code indicates an accident occurred in an unspecified home environment.\n",
      "10. **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** Lab results show \"Hb 9.4,\" which is below the normal range for hemoglobin, indicating anemia. No specific cause or type is detailed, so \"unspecified\" is appropriate.\n",
      "11. **M1990 (Unspecified osteoarthritis, unspecified site):** While not explicitly stated, \"chronic pain syndrome\" is a broad diagnosis. Osteoarthritis is a very common underlying cause of chronic pain, especially in older adults, making it a plausible diagnosis for an unspecified site when \"chronic pain syndrome\" is noted.\n",
      "12. **J181 (Lobar pneumonia, unspecified organism):** The patient was \"recently hospitalized at ___ for fibrinous organizing pneumonia.\" While J84.89 is very specific, J18.1 might have been used for the acute, severe presentation of the pneumonia, referring to an acute lobar pattern of inflammation or as an initial, less specific diagnosis before the full characterization of organizing pneumonia.\n",
      "13. **T404X1A (Poisoning by other opioids, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter):** The patient has a \"hx sedative hypnotic dependence\" and \"hx unintentional overdoses.\" While the *current* overdose is specified as benzodiazepines (Klonopin), \"sedative hypnotic dependence\" can be a broader term and \"hx unintentional overdoses\" could include prior incidents involving opioids, particularly given the \"chronic pain syndrome,\" for which opioids are often prescribed. Although not explicitly mentioned for the current event, this code points to a history of opioid-related issues.\n",
      "14. **E041 (Nontoxic uninodular goiter):** There is no direct mention of a goiter or thyroid condition in the provided \"History of Present Illness.\" This code would typically be assigned based on the patient's comprehensive past medical history, which is not fully detailed in this specific HPI excerpt. Its inclusion indicates it is a known, pre-existing condition.\n",

      "2.  **D6481 (Anemia, other specified)**: The patient's lab results show \"HCT 23.5,\" which is significantly low, indicating anemia. Given the context of chemotherapy and malignancy, this is likely an anemia secondary to other specified causes.\n",
      "3.  **D6959 (Other secondary thrombocytopenia)**: The patient's lab results show \"PLT 40,\" which is a very low platelet count, indicating thrombocytopenia. This is secondary to the underlying malignancy and/or chemotherapy.\n",
      "4.  **D701 (Agranulocytosis)**: The record mentions \"recent neutropenia\" and specifically states \"ANC 290\" which is an extremely low absolute neutrophil count, falling under the definition of agranulocytosis.\n",
      "5.  **E861 (Volume depletion)**: The patient presented with \"fatigue and low grade temperature,\" and her \"headache has resolved after fluids in ED (1LNS),\" suggesting that she was experiencing symptoms related to volume depletion or dehydration which improved with fluid administration.\n",
      "6.  **E876 (Hypokalemia)**: The patient's lab results show \"K 3.2,\" which is below the normal range for potassium, indicating hypokalemia.\n",
      "7.  **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified)**: The patient is undergoing intensive chemotherapy (CHOP, GND). Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a well-known and common side effect of many antineoplastic agents. While not explicitly stated as a current symptom in the HPI, it is a highly probable chronic condition or side effect of her treatment.\n",
      "8.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**: Hypertension is a very common chronic comorbidity in adults. While her BP is 124/70 (normal), this could be a controlled essential hypertension that is part of her established medical history.\n",
      "9.  **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified)**: Although her BP was 124/70 in the ED after fluids, the patient presented with fatigue and malaise, and had tachycardia (HR 126). Transient hypotensive episodes (e.g., orthostatic hypotension or related to acute illness/dehydration before fluid resuscitation) could have occurred, leading to this diagnosis. Tachycardia can be a compensatory mechanism for hypotension.\n",
      "10. **J3489 (Other specified disorders of nose and nasal sinuses)**: This code represents a chronic or specified condition of the nose or nasal sinuses. While the HPI states \"No sore throat or congestion,\" this refers to acute symptoms. The patient could have a pre-existing, non-acute condition like chronic rhinitis or polyps that is part of their problem list.\n",
      "11. **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified)**: The patient's vital signs in the ED included \"HR 126,\" which is an elevated heart rate, indicative of tachycardia.\n",
      "12. **R5081 (Fever in other conditions)**: The chief complaint is \"Fever.\" The patient was \"repeatedly febrile,\" developed a \"fever to 100.8,\" and had a \"low grade temperature,\" all of which directly support this code.\n",
      "13. **T451X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter)**: The record states \"fever thought to be due to malignant process and/or gemcitabine.\" Gemcitabine is an antineoplastic drug, and fever is a recognized adverse effect of such medications. The \"A\" signifies an initial encounter for the adverse effect.\n",
      "14. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence)**: The patient awoke with symptoms at home and then presented to the ED. The specific place of occurrence for the initial onset of symptoms is not precisely defined beyond \"home,\" making an unspecified code appropriate for the external cause.\n",

The history mentions \"elevated LFTs\" and the \"ERCP with stone extraction, CBD stent placement\" confirms the presence of bile duct stones requiring intervention, implying obstruction and likely associated cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts).\n",
      "2.  **K8010 (Calculus of bile duct with cholangitis, unspecified, without obstruction):** The diagnosis of \"choledocholithiasis\" can also be coded more broadly as calculus of the bile duct with cholangitis. While K8030 specifies obstruction, K8010 might be used to capture the presence of stones and inflammation (cholangitis, implied by elevated LFTs) even if obstruction wasn't the initial or sole presentation, or to cover a less severe aspect of the disease.\n",
      "3.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's history includes \"history of hypertension.\"\n",

      "2.  **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** The initial vital signs in the ED show a heart rate of \"HR 116,\" which indicates tachycardia.\n",
      "3.  **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids and synthetic analogues, initial encounter):** The patient \"ran out of her Advair several days ago.\" Advair contains fluticasone, a glucocorticoid. The subsequent asthma exacerbation can be considered an adverse effect or withdrawal symptom due to the cessation of her prescribed glucocorticoid medication. The 'X5A' suffix denotes an adverse effect, initial encounter.\n",
      "4.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** The patient has a \"history of thoracic outlet syndrome.\" This is a significant past medical condition that falls under the category of a \"personal history of other specified conditions\" not covered by a more specific Z-code.\n",
      "5.  **R740 (Nonspecific elevation of levels of transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase):** The provided lab results only mention D-Dimer, HCO3, and Anion Gap. There is no explicit mention of elevated transaminases (ALT/AST) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Therefore, the assignment of this code implies that other lab tests, not detailed in this specific medical record excerpt, showed a nonspecific elevation of these enzymes.\n",
      "6.  **D72829 (Other specified disorders of white blood cells, unspecified):** The medical record does not explicitly provide information about the patient's white blood cell count or differential. The assignment of D72829 suggests that there was a documented, but unspecified in this record, disorder related to white blood cells.\n",
      "7.  **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The medical record states that the patient \"presented to the ED\" but does not provide any information about the patient residing in or coming from a nursing home. The assignment of Y92239 implies that the event or the patient's condition originated or was associated with a nursing home as the place of occurrence, a detail not present in the provided HPI.\n",

      "1.  **N401 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms):** This code is directly assigned due to the patient's chief complaint and history of present illness stating \"BPH/BOO\" (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia / Bladder Outlet Obstruction). \"Lower urinary tract symptoms\" are inherent to BOO and urinary retention.\n",
      "2.  **R338 (Other retention of urine):** This code is assigned based on the history of present illness which explicitly mentions \"multiple episodes of urinary retention.\"\n",
      "3.  **N138 (Other obstructive uropathy):** This code describes the \"BOO\" (Bladder Outlet Obstruction) mentioned in the chief complaint and history. While BPH is the underlying cause, N138 specifically captures the obstructive aspect of the uropathy.\n",
      "4.  **C61 (Malignant neoplasm of prostate):** Although the chief complaint and HPI initially refer to \"BPH/BOO\" (benign conditions), the presence of the C61 code indicates that a malignant neoplasm of the prostate was either diagnosed prior to or confirmed after the \"PROSTATECTOMY SIMPLE ROBOTIC LAPAROSCOPIC\" procedure. A prostatectomy is a common treatment for prostate cancer.\n",
      "5.  **Z87440 (Personal history of benign prostatic hyperplasia):** This code reflects the patient's documented \"history of BPH/BOO,\" which was the presenting problem and primary indication for the surgical intervention. Even if a malignancy was discovered, the benign hyperplasia was also present in the patient's history.\n",
      "6.  **R310 (Gross hematuria):** While not explicitly stated in the provided snippet of the medical record, the assignment of this code indicates that the patient experienced gross hematuria (visible blood in urine). Hematuria is a common symptom associated with conditions like BPH, urinary retention, or prostate cancer, and would have been documented in the full clinical context.\n",
      "7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This code indicates that the patient has a history of or current hyperlipidemia. Although not mentioned in the brief chief complaint or HPI, hyperlipidemia is a common chronic comorbidity frequently documented in a patient's comprehensive medical history, which led to its inclusion in the patient's ICD-10 codes.\n",
      "8.  **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This code indicates that the patient has a personal history of nicotine dependence. Similar to hyperlipidemia, this is a common chronic comorbidity often documented in a patient's comprehensive medical history, even if not explicitly detailed in the provided HPI snippet.\n",

      "6.  **Z992 (Dependence on renal dialysis):** The patient is \"on HD\" (on Hemodialysis), which means they are dependent on renal dialysis.\n",
      "7.  **Z955 (Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft):** The history mentions \"s/p recent PTCA and DES to RCA\" (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty and Drug-Eluting Stent to Right Coronary Artery). This indicates the presence of a coronary stent.\n",
      "8.  **I70262 (Atherosclerosis of native arteries of extremities with ulceration of heel and midfoot, left leg):** The Chief Complaint is \"Peripheral Vascular Disease (PAD)\". The HPI further details \"PAD\" and \"presents with a left toe injury that has failed to heal and has become infected, noninvasive vascular studies suggestive of a diminished toe pressure on the left.\" This indicates atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries with a non-healing lesion (ulceration) on the left leg/foot. The specific location \"heel and midfoot\" in the code is a common site for such ulcers.\n",
      "9.  **J810 (Acute pulmonary edema with hypersecretion of mucus):** While not explicitly stated in the chief complaint or HPI symptoms for the current presentation, patients with ESRD, fluid overload (E8770), and underlying cardiac conditions (CAD, AFib) are at high risk for acute pulmonary edema. This could be an acute exacerbation or a comorbidity identified during the hospital stay, even if not the primary reason for the angiogram.\n",
      "10. **E8770 (Fluid overload, unspecified):** Patients with ESRD on hemodialysis are prone to fluid overload, especially if dialysis is not optimally managed or if they have interdialytic weight gain. This is a common and serious complication in this patient population.\n",
      "11. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Although not explicitly stated in the provided HPI snippet, a personal history of nicotine dependence is a very common and significant risk factor for the patient's extensive cardiovascular diseases (CAD, PAD, HTN) and is frequently coded for such patients to reflect their overall risk profile.\n",

      "2.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, without status asthmaticus):** The patient has a \"history of asthma.\" The HPI describes acute \"chest tightness\" and \"dyspnea,\" and the patient took \"a friend's inhaler prescribed some relief,\" all consistent with an asthma exacerbation. The absence of findings like severe wheezing in the ED exam and improvement with nebulizers suggests it was not a severe, complicated exacerbation or status asthmaticus, thus \"unspecified asthma, uncomplicated\" is appropriate.\n",
      "3.  **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** The chief complaint includes \"Dysuria.\" The HPI mentions \"burning urination.\" Laboratory results show the UA was \"nitrite positive with large leuks, WBC >182,\" which are strong indicators of a urinary tract infection. The patient also received Ceftriaxone and IV fluids due to \"concern for urosepsis,\" reinforcing the diagnosis of UTI.\n",
      "4.  **Z6843 (Body mass index (BMI) 40.0-49.9, adult):** This code provides more specificity for the patient's obesity. While \"obesity\" is mentioned, this code implies a specific BMI range was assessed or documented, classifying the patient's obesity as Class III (morbid obesity), which is a common accompanying code for E66.9.\n",
      "5.  **A4151 (Sepsis due to Escherichia coli):** The patient presented with \"rigors,\" \"fevers\" (spiked to T 102.8), \"HR 110,\" \"WBC 17.0,\" and \"lactate 2.6.\" These are signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Coupled with a confirmed urinary tract infection (N390) and \"concern for urosepsis,\" a diagnosis of sepsis is indicated. Given that the UA was \"nitrite positive,\" a common finding in UTIs caused by gram-negative bacteria, and E. coli is the most prevalent cause of UTIs leading to urosepsis, coding for sepsis due to E. coli is appropriate even without explicit culture confirmation in this record snippet.\n",

Anxiety is a common psychological response in such scenarios.\n",
      "9.  **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** While not explicitly stated in this HPI, a history of TIA or stroke is a common comorbidity or related vascular event in patients with extensive cardiovascular disease requiring CABG. It indicates a broader history of vascular compromise.\n",
      "10. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a general \"personal history\" code used to capture other significant past medical conditions or risk factors that are not covered by more specific Z-codes, but are relevant to the patient's overall health status and management.\n",

      "1.  **\"___ man with history of Grave's s/p thyroidectomy\"**:\n",
      "    *   `E890` (Postprocedural hypothyroidism): Thyroidectomy often leads to hypothyroidism, making this a direct consequence of the \"s/p thyroidectomy\" (status post thyroidectomy).\n",
      "    *   `Z86010` (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid): While Grave's disease itself is not malignant, a thyroidectomy might also be performed due to or reveal a history of thyroid malignancy. The presence of this code suggests such a history, even if not explicitly detailed in this HPI snippet.\n",
      "    *   `Y838` (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure): This external cause code attributes the hypothyroidism (E890) to the prior thyroidectomy, indicating it's a complication of the surgical procedure.\n",

      "2.  **\"scratched his right hand on a rose thorn\"** and subsequent \"painful, pruritic vesicle with surrounding erythema\" on right thumb, spreading to \"right wrist and right hand,\" \"left thigh and left anterior shin, and later his lower back\":\n",
      "    *   `B421` (Cutaneous-lymphatic sporotrichosis): This clinical picture is classic for \"rose gardener's disease,\" a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix, which typically presents after a puncture wound from plant material (like a rose thorn) and spreads along lymphatic channels.\n",
      "    *   `L0103` (Cutaneous abscess of right thumb): The initial \"painful, pruritic vesicle with surrounding erythema\" at the site of the thorn prick on the right thumb could have progressed to a localized bacterial infection or abscess.\n",
      "    *   `B958` (Other specified bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere): If there's an abscess (L0103), a bacterial agent is involved. This code indicates the presence of a bacterial infection, possibly secondary to the thorn injury or complicating the sporotrichosis.\n",

      "3.  **\"on ___ he awoke and his brother pointed out two small white spots on his left cheek that appeared to be due to a bug bite. He also developed left-sided facial and eyelid swelling, and tender lymphadenopathy on the left side of his neck.\"**:\n",
      "    *   `B029` (Zoster without complication, unspecified): Although initially attributed to a \"bug bite\" and described as \"white spots\" (which is atypical for zoster), the subsequent development of unilateral facial and eyelid swelling along with tender lymphadenopathy on the same side of the neck is highly suggestive of an acute zoster (shingles) infection, particularly given its potential to affect cranial nerves and cause localized swelling. The code implies a clinical diagnosis was made.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **\"He reports that his bilateral ears feel full. His sinuses also feel full and he has been using a Netipot.\"**:\n",
      "    *   `J0100` (Acute maxillary sinusitis, unspecified): The sensation of \"full\" sinuses and the use of a Netipot indicate an acute inflammatory process in the sinuses.\n",
      "    *   `J320` (Chronic maxillary sinusitis): The statement \"he has been using a Netipot\" implies a long-standing or recurrent sinus issue, which aligns with a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis, potentially with an acute exacerbation (J0100).\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **\"developed chills that have persisted. When he began to take his temperature several days prior to admission he found that he had fevers.\"** and **\"In the ED, vitals: Tmax 102.5\"**:\n",
      "    *   `A419` (Sepsis, unspecified organism): The combination of persistent fevers (Tmax 102.5), chills, rash, facial swelling, and lymphadenopathy, especially with multiple suspected infections (sporotrichosis, zoster, secondary bacterial infection), indicates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that could be diagnosed as sepsis.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **General Medical History/Comorbidities:**\n",

      "1.  **Q560 (Hermaphroditism not elsewhere classified):** The medical record explicitly states the patient is \"intersexual (hermaphrodite)\" and notes a discrepancy between assigned sex (M) and identified gender (F). This code directly represents this biological and gender identity status.\n",
      "2.  **F339 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified):** The patient reports an \"extended period of feeling extremely down and sad; waking up each morning thinking to herself 'god, not another.'\" She expresses feeling \"very upset and let down,\" that her \"dream is dead,\" and that she would \"like to die, in reality,\" noting she \"can't enjoy life anymore.\" She endorses \"ongoing SI with desire not to live anymore.\" These symptoms are classic for major depressive disorder. The \"recurrent, unspecified\" suggests a history of such episodes without detailing the current episode's severity or full remission status.\n",
      "3.  **F4312 (Post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic):** The record states \"reported past psychiatric history of PTSD.\" Additionally, the patient's \"refugee\" status, \"nightmares, that include having her throat slit by zombies, or being chased or killed by wolves or dogs,\" and \"paranoid ideation, particularly a fear of someone breaking through her window and trying to attack her,\" are all consistent with chronic PTSD symptoms.\n",
      "4.  **F4311 (Post-traumatic stress disorder, acute):** While F4312 indicates chronic PTSD, F4311 might be used to specify an acute exacerbation or an acute stress reaction presenting at the time of the encounter, given the severity of her current symptoms (e.g., the acute suicidal ideation, intense anxiety, and paranoia). The current crisis and her presentation to the ED could be interpreted as an acute phase of her PTSD.\n",
      "5.  **F4321 (Adjustment disorder with depressed mood):** The patient's significant distress is directly linked to an identifiable stressor: her refugee experience. She reports \"feeling very upset and let down that ___ is not as she imagined it would be, that ___ is the 'end of the world' and that now her dream is dead.\" This maladaptive emotional and behavioral reaction to a clear psychosocial stressor, accompanied by symptoms of sadness and desire not to live, perfectly aligns with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient's ICD-10 codes reflect her intersexual status (Q560), a significant mood disorder characterized by recurrent major depression (F339), chronic PTSD with an acute component (F4312, F4311), and an adjustment disorder related to her refugee experience and unmet expectations, presenting with depressed mood (F4321).\n",

      "3.  **I69959 (Dysphagia following unspecified cerebrovascular disease):** The patient has \"dysphagia,\" which is explicitly stated as a finding following the CVA.\n",
      "4.  **I69991 (Aphasia following unspecified cerebrovascular disease):** The patient has \"dysarthria and pseudobulbar and bulbar findings.\" While dysarthria is distinct from aphasia (difficulty with articulation vs. language comprehension/expression), severe CVA-related speech and communication difficulties, especially with pseudobulbar involvement, can be broadly categorized under aphasia or other communication disorders in a coding context, implying a significant impairment in verbal communication.\n",
      "5.  **I69998 (Other sequelae of unspecified cerebrovascular disease):** This code covers \"pseudobulbar and bulbar findings\" and other long-term effects of the CVA not captured by more specific codes (like hemiplegia, dysphagia, or aphasia).\n",

      "7.  **J387 (Other diseases of larynx, unspecified):** This code accounts for \"bilateral vocal fold atrophy\" and \"secondary muscle tension dysphonia,\" which are other laryngeal conditions affecting the patient's voice and potentially contributing to dysphagia.\n",
      "8.  **Z993 (Dependence on wheelchair):** The patient is described as \"wheelchair bound,\" indicating a reliance on a wheelchair for mobility.\n",
      "9.  **N12 (Tubulo-interstitial nephritis, not specified as acute or chronic):** The patient \"Found to have a UTI at urgent care.\" N12 represents a type of kidney infection (like pyelonephritis) that can stem from a UTI, indicating a more specific diagnosis for the infection found.\n",
      "10. **A4189 (Other specified septicemia):** Given the patient's compromised state (multiple comorbidities from CVA, dysphagia, wheelchair-bound) and presentation with a \"fever of 102.9°F\" and a \"UTI,\" septicemia (blood infection) is a strong possibility and a common acute complication.\n",
      "11. **D638 (Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere):** Anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic illnesses, especially with a history of CVA, dysphagia (potentially affecting nutrition), and general debility.\n",
      "12. **D6959 (Other secondary thrombocytopenia):** Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) can be a complication of severe infection like sepsis or other acute medical conditions, which might be present in this acutely ill patient.\n",
      "13. **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with neurological complications, unspecified):** The patient's history mentions \"neuropathy.\" While not explicitly stating diabetes, given the co-occurrence of HTN and CVA, Type 2 Diabetes is a very common comorbidity and a frequent cause of neuropathy, making this a plausible inference.\n",
      "14. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has an allergy to \"simvastatin,\" a medication primarily used to treat hyperlipidemia. This strongly suggests a history of hyperlipidemia, even if not explicitly stated as a diagnosis.\n",
      "15. **E876 (Hypokalemia):** This is an electrolyte imbalance that can occur in acutely ill patients due to various factors, including infection, dehydration, or renal issues.\n",
      "16. **R1310 (Dysphagia, unspecified):** While I69.959 is specific to CVA-related dysphagia, R13.10 is a general symptom code for dysphagia. Both might be coded if the general symptom is also being documented or if there are multiple contributing factors.\n",
      "17. **R490 (Dysphonia):** The patient has \"dysarthria\" and \"secondary muscle tension dysphonia.\" Dysphonia is a general term for voice impairment or difficulty, encompassing both of these conditions.\n",
      "18. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Patients with a history of CVA are frequently on long-term anticoagulation to prevent future strokes. While not explicitly mentioned in this brief HPI, it's a common and expected aspect of their medical management.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia)**: The history mentions \"diabetes.\" Given the term \"uncontrolled hypertension,\" it is reasonable to infer the diabetes is also poorly controlled, leading to a complication like hyperglycemia, or this is a common default code for unspecified Type 2 diabetes with complications.\n",
      "2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: Although not explicitly stated, hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor and a very common comorbidity in patients with a history of MI, uncontrolled hypertension, and extensive coronary artery disease (CAD), including prior CABG.\n",
      "3.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated)**: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Myocardial Infarction (MI), and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) are strongly associated with a history of smoking. This code is often assigned as a historical factor in such patients.\n",
      "4.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure)**: The patient has a history of \"uncontrolled hypertension\" and significant cardiac history (MI, CABG, current acute cardiac event). Uncontrolled hypertension often leads to hypertensive heart disease, and in the context of such severe CAD, heart failure (even if not explicitly stated as an acute finding in this snippet) is a common chronic complication.\n",
      "5.  **I214 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction)**: The chief complaint of \"Chest pain with nausea and diaphoresis,\" combined with the HPI stating \"this episode was more severe in quality and length\" and \"A cath... revealed 100% occluded RCA graft,\" strongly indicates an acute myocardial infarction. The absence of \"STEMI\" suggests NSTEMI.\n",
      "6.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction)**: The patient's \"PMH notable for MI in ___\" directly supports this code for a healed or previous myocardial infarction.\n",
      "7.  **I25810 (Atherosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft(s) with unstable angina pectoris)**: The patient has a history of \"3 vessel CABG ___,\" and the current presentation includes \"100% occluded RCA graft.\" Furthermore, \"He had been experiencing chest pain both with exertion and at rest for one month but this episode was more severe in quality and length\" describes unstable angina pectoris. This code perfectly captures the graft disease with unstable angina.\n",
      "8.  **I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, moderate)**: This code for chronic diastolic heart failure is plausible given the patient's long-standing history of hypertension, MI, and CABG, which predispose to diastolic dysfunction. The \"moderate\" severity would likely be determined by cardiac imaging (e.g., echocardiogram) results not explicitly detailed in this short HPI.\n",
      "9.  **Y832 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure)**: The \"100% occluded RCA graft\" is a late complication or \"abnormal reaction\" related to the prior \"3 vessel CABG,\" which is a \"surgical procedure.\"\n",
      "10. **Y92009 (Unspecified place of occurrence, public building)**: This is an external cause code indicating the location where the injury or event (e.g., onset of severe chest pain) occurred. \"presented to ___ on ___\" implies the patient came from an outside location, but no specific home or other environment is mentioned, making \"unspecified public building\" a general choice for a non-residential, unspecific location.\n",
      "11. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of insulin)**: Given the diagnosis of \"diabetes\" (Type 2) and the term \"uncontrolled hypertension\" which implies poor management, it is very common for such patients to be on long-term insulin therapy.\n",
      "12. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs)**: Similarly, for Type 2 diabetes, long-term use of oral hypoglycemic drugs is standard treatment, often in combination with insulin.\n",
      "13. **Z8249 (Family history of other ischemic heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system)**: A family history of heart disease is a significant risk factor for conditions like MI and CAD and is routinely documented in the full medical history for patients with extensive cardiac disease like this individual, even if not explicitly written in this HPI snippet.\n",

      "1.  **B951 (Streptococcus, group B, as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** The medical record explicitly states, \"UA/UCx was sent, which today came back growing Group B strep.\" This code identifies the specific bacterial organism causing the urinary tract infection.\n",
      "2.  **D61818 (Other specified pancytopenia):** While not directly stated, the patient has a complex medical history including \"severe malnutrition secondary to dysphagia post-procedure\" and \"CKD.\" These conditions, along with immunosuppression post-transplant, can contribute to various hematological abnormalities, including pancytopenia, making it a plausible underlying condition documented in the full medical history.\n",
      "3.  **D631 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease):** The patient's Past Medical History (PMH) includes \"CKD\" (Chronic Kidney Disease). Anemia is a very common and expected complication of chronic kidney disease.\n",
      "4.  **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** The chief complaint and current symptom is \"Dysuria.\" While dysuria is an acute pain symptom, the patient's complex chronic conditions, including a history of colon resection and frequent urination, suggest a potential for underlying or intermittent chronic pain, even if the current acute dysuria is primarily due to the UTI.\n",
      "5.  **I4581 (Brugada syndrome):** This cardiac condition is not mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness or Past Medical History. Its inclusion implies it is a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this specific encounter's HPI.\n",

The patient specifically \"denied any recent fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough.\" Its inclusion implies it is a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this specific encounter's HPI.\n",
      "7.  **K529 (Noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified):** The patient has a history of \"EtOH cirrhosis,\" \"s/p orthotopic liver transplant,\" \"severe malnutrition secondary to dysphagia post-procedure now with G-tube,\" and \"history of colon cancer s/p colonic resection.\" These multiple gastrointestinal issues increase the likelihood of various gastrointestinal inflammations or disturbances, which could be coded as noninfectious gastroenteritis or colitis.\n",
      "8.  **M549 (Dorsalgia, unspecified):** This condition (back pain) is not mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness or Past Medical History. Its inclusion implies it is a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this specific encounter's HPI.\n",
      "9.  **M810 (Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture):** Osteoporosis is a common condition in older adults, particularly those with a history of chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, severe malnutrition, and long-term immunosuppression (often used post-transplant, as suggested by \"Prograf\" allergy). While not explicitly stated, it is a highly plausible comorbidity.\n",
      "10. **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** The patient's PMH explicitly states \"CKD\" (Chronic Kidney Disease). This code directly corresponds to that diagnosis.\n",
      "11. **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** The chief complaint is \"Dysuria, UTI,\" and the patient \"presents with dysuria.\" This code directly represents an unspecified urinary tract infection.\n",
      "12. **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** The patient is a male who reports frequent urination \"consistent with his baseline.\" In an older male, this suggests underlying Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). N400 specifies BPH *without* current lower urinary tract symptoms, implying that while BPH is present, the acute dysuria and other current symptoms are attributed primarily to the UTI, not BPH itself.\n",
      "13. **Z85038 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of large intestine):** The patient has a \"history of colon cancer s/p colonic resection.\" This code indicates a personal history of malignant neoplasm of the large intestine.\n",
      "14. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided History of Present Illness. It is a common comorbidity, and its inclusion implies it is a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this specific encounter's HPI.\n",
      "15. **Z944 (Kidney transplant status):** The medical record explicitly states \"s/p orthotopic *liver* transplant.\" However, Z944 specifically codes for \"Kidney transplant status.\" Given the instruction to infer why the code was assigned, it suggests that the patient also has a history of kidney transplant, even though this particular medical record excerpt only mentions the liver transplant. There appears to be a discrepancy between the provided HPI and this specific ICD-10 code, or the full medical record contains information not present in this excerpt regarding a kidney transplant.\n",

      "1.  **R4182 (Altered mental status, unspecified):** This code is directly assigned due to the patient's Chief Complaint of \"altered mental status\" and the repeated descriptions in the History of Present Illness (HPI) such as \"nodding off,\" \"somnolent,\" \"only alert to some verbal, but mainly painful stimulus,\" indicating a clear change in the patient's normal mental state.\n",
      "2.  **F1120 (Opioid dependence, uncomplicated):** The HPI states \"PMH substance abuse\" and describes symptoms highly consistent with opioid intoxication: \"nodding off,\" \"somnolence,\" and notably \"pinpoint pupils.\" The patient \"may have told EMS that he took narcotics.\" These findings strongly support a diagnosis of opioid dependence as part of his past medical history.\n",
      "3.  **T402X1A (Poisoning by other opioids, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter):** This code signifies acute opioid intoxication/poisoning. The patient's acute presentation with altered mental status, somnolence, and pinpoint pupils, along with the suspicion of recent narcotic intake, is characteristic of an acute opioid overdose, likely accidental given no other context. \"Initial encounter\" indicates the first time this patient is being treated for this specific poisoning.\n",
      "4.  **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** The patient's \"altered mental status\" and profound somnolence, directly attributed to the suspected opioid intoxication, indicates brain dysfunction caused by a toxic substance, which is the definition of toxic encephalopathy.\n",
      "5.  **F1490 (Cocaine use, unspecified, uncomplicated):** While not explicitly detailed in the immediate HPI as part of the current episode, the \"PMH substance abuse\" often encompasses polysubstance use. Cocaine use disorder is a common comorbidity with opioid use disorder and would be part of a broader past medical history.\n",
      "6.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** Nicotine dependence is an extremely common comorbidity among individuals with other substance use disorders. It is likely part of the patient's comprehensive \"PMH substance abuse,\" even if not specifically mentioned in the acute presentation.\n",
      "7.  **F1910 (Other psychoactive substance abuse, uncomplicated):** This code accounts for the abuse of other unspecified psychoactive substances, which is common in patients with a general \"PMH substance abuse\" beyond specific opioids, cocaine, or nicotine.\n",
      "8.  **B1920 (Unspecified viral hepatitis C without hepatic coma):** Hepatitis C is a known and common comorbidity for individuals with a history of substance abuse, particularly intravenous drug use, which is frequently associated with opioid dependence. This would likely be part of the patient's established past medical history.\n",
      "9.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Although not explicitly stated as a chronic diagnosis, hypertension is a very common chronic condition. The initial vital signs include a blood pressure of 132/86, which is borderline hypertensive. It is plausible that this is a pre-existing condition from the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "10. **F259 (Unspecified schizoaffective disorder):** The complex nature of \"PMH substance abuse\" can sometimes co-occur with severe mental illnesses. While not directly evident in the acute HPI, this code suggests a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis as part of the patient's comprehensive medical history.\n",
      "11. **E872 (Acidosis):** No direct lab evidence (e.g., ABG results) is provided in the HPI excerpt. However, severe opioid intoxication can lead to respiratory depression, which can cause respiratory acidosis. It is a potential complication that could have been diagnosed with further workup in the ED, not detailed in this HPI.\n",

      "1.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Directly supported by the patient's \"h/o CAD\" (history of Coronary Artery Disease). This code reflects the underlying chronic condition of atherosclerosis.\n",
      "2.  **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** The patient's history includes \"s/p CABG\" (status post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft), indicating the presence of a bypass graft.\n",
      "3.  **I214 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction):** The chief complaint is \"Chest pain,\" described as \"left-sided chest pain which occurs with exertion, occasionally at rest and lasts minutes at a time,\" which is highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, specifically NSTEMI. The mention of \"Stress MIBI\" further points to cardiac investigation.\n",
      "4.  **I5033 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, unspecified severity):** Symptoms reported include \"shortness of breath with exertion and when lying flat\" (dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea) and \"bilateral lower extremity swelling,\" which are classic signs of heart failure. Given the history of CAD and prior cardiac procedures, heart failure is a common complication.\n",
      "5.  **I130 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This combination code is assigned due to the patient's \"h/o HTN\" (Hypertension), \"CKD stage 2\" (Chronic Kidney Disease), and current symptoms indicative of heart failure (dyspnea, edema).\n",
      "6.  **E1122 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease):** The patient has a \"h/o DM\" (Diabetes Mellitus) and \"CKD stage 2.\" This code specifically links these two conditions as a diabetic complication.\n",
      "7.  **N182 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 2 (mild)):** Directly stated in the patient's history as \"CKD stage 2.\"\n",
      "8.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** In the context of multiple acute issues (cardiac event, potential infection, and existing CKD), acute kidney injury is a common and serious complication, often identified by lab findings during hospitalization.\n",
      "9.  **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction):** The patient has a \"h/o CVA\" (Cerebrovascular Accident), which falls under the category of cerebral infarction.\n",
      "10. **Z86711 (Personal history of phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, and thromboembolism):** The patient's history includes \"h/o ... PE\" (Pulmonary Embolism).\n",
      "11. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** Given the \"h/o DM\" (Diabetes Mellitus), it is common for type 2 diabetic patients, especially with multiple comorbidities, to require long-term insulin therapy for glucose management.\n",
      "12. **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** The patient presents with \"cough, dyspnea.\" While these can be symptoms of heart failure or other conditions, asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition often co-diagnosed or considered in such presentations.\n",
      "13. **H1089 (Other conjunctivitis):** The HPI states the patient \"was seen by ophthalmology earlier today who prescribed her an antibiotic ointment for the eyes recommended follow-up in the next few days for bacterial conjunctivitis.\"\n",
      "14. **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** The patient reports \"left-sided chest pain which occurs with exertion, occasionally at rest and lasts minutes at a time.\" While this is primarily attributed to acute cardiac issues, this code may be used to document a broader chronic pain component the patient experiences due to their multiple health conditions.\n",
      "15. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common comorbidity in patients with Coronary Artery Disease, Diabetes Mellitus, and Hypertension, even if not explicitly stated in the brief HPI. It is routinely coded in such patients.\n",
      "16. **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** Anemia is a common finding in patients with chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease and heart failure. This is a plausible, frequently co-occurring condition.\n",
      "17. **E1142 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy):** Diabetic polyneuropathy is a common long-term complication of diabetes, even if not specifically detailed in the provided HPI.\n",
      "18. **F0390 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance):** Given the patient's age and history of CVA (stroke), the development of dementia (e.g., vascular dementia) is a common comorbidity.\n",
      "19. **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Patients facing multiple severe and chronic illnesses often experience depression, making this a common and plausible co-diagnosis.\n",
      "20. **B999 (Unspecified infectious disease):** This general code for infection could be assigned in relation to the \"bacterial conjunctivitis\" or the potential \"urinary tract infection\" (implied by increased urinary frequency and right-sided flank pain consistent with prior UTI) if more specific infection codes for these were not deemed sufficient or fully identified.\n",
      "21. **E875 (Hyperkalemia):** This is a metabolic disturbance (high potassium levels) typically identified through lab tests. It is a common finding in patients with kidney dysfunction (CKD, AKI) or those on certain medications.\n",
      "22. **R740 (Nonspecific elevation of levels of transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase):** These are laboratory findings indicating tissue damage or stress, often seen in conditions like myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute kidney injury, or other systemic stresses.\n",
      "23. **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** While not explicitly mentioned in the HPI, a history of CVA (stroke) can predispose an individual to seizures. This code may represent a previously diagnosed and stable epileptic condition.\n",
      "24. **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy):** This refers to brain dysfunction caused by toxins. In the context of severe systemic illness, such as acute kidney injury, metabolic derangements can lead to uremic encephalopathy, which falls under this category.\n",
      "25. **T424X5A (Adverse effect of benzodiazepines, initial encounter):** There is no explicit mention of benzodiazepine use or an adverse effect in the HPI. However, benzodiazepines are sometimes used for anxiety or sedation in acutely ill patients, and an adverse reaction could have occurred, which would be documented in the full chart.\n",
      "26. **Y92230 (Medical research institution as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** There is no information in the provided HPI regarding an external cause of injury or a medical research institution. This code is highly incongruous with the given clinical narrative and may be an administrative error or pertain to information not supplied in this limited record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient is an elderly female with a complex medical history including CAD (s/p CABG, PCI), CKD Stage 2, CVA, HTN, DM, and PE. She presented acutely with chest pain (diagnosed as NSTEMI), dyspnea, and edema consistent with heart failure. She also has active bacterial conjunctivitis and potential urinary issues. Her chronic conditions are complicated by acute kidney failure and various metabolic issues.\n",

      "4.  **D320 (Benign neoplasm of cerebral meninges):** A CT scan \"showed known left parietal meningioma.\" This code directly corresponds to the diagnosis of a meningioma.\n",
      "5.  **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** The patient experienced \"hallucinations...sees flashes of light and also insects on the floor; when she wakes up she sometimes does not know where she is and is confused\" and \"auditory hallucinations.\" These symptoms, especially in the context of a brain meningioma, are highly suggestive of epileptic seizures.\n",
      "6.  **D61818 (Other specified pancytopenia):** Lab results revealed \"mild pancytopenia.\" This code directly represents this finding.\n",
      "7.  **D638 (Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere):** Pancytopenia includes anemia. Given the patient's underlying \"scleroderma\" and general debilitation, anemia secondary to chronic disease is a very common association.\n",
      "8.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** Lab results showed \"low free T4 with normal TSH.\" This pattern is consistent with hypothyroidism, whether primary, subclinical, or non-thyroidal illness syndrome (sick euthyroid syndrome) that is still coded as hypothyroidism.\n",
      "9.  **E2740 (Unspecified adrenocortical insufficiency):** The patient presents with severe \"fatigue, malaise,\" \"low BPs\" (requiring discontinuation of amlodipine), and overall poor energy, which can be symptoms prompting investigation or diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency.\n",
      "10. **E230 (Hypopituitarism):** If both the hypothyroidism (low free T4 with normal TSH) and adrenocortical insufficiency (suspected from symptoms/low BP) are secondary, hypopituitarism could be the unifying diagnosis for these endocrine deficiencies.\n",
      "11. **E162 (Hypoglycemia, unspecified):** The patient has \"poor appetite,\" \"eating minimally,\" and significant \"weight loss\" (40 lb over past year). These factors put her at risk for hypoglycemia.\n",
      "12. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common chronic comorbidity. While not explicitly detailed in the HPI, it is frequently part of a patient's problem list or past medical history.\n",

      "3.  **MRI characterizing an 11mm fluid filled appendix characterizing an acute appendicitis**: MRI進一步明確了液體積聚位於闌尾，並診斷為「急性闌尾炎」。這明確指向了闌尾的炎症和液體積聚，可能暗示闌尾的嚴重炎症、積膿，甚至潛在的穿孔或局部膿腫形成。\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **S32432A (Displaced transverse fracture of left acetabulum, initial encounter for closed fracture) and S32592A (Other specified fracture of left acetabulum, initial encounter for closed fracture):** These codes directly correspond to the Chief Complaint \"Left acetabular fracture\" and the subsequent \"Surgical fixation, left acetabular fracture.\" The presence of two specific codes for acetabular fractures suggests a complex fracture or multiple fracture components of the left acetabulum. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter for the injury.\n",
      "2.  **W109XXA (Fall on and from stairs and steps, unspecified, initial encounter):** This external cause code is assigned because the patient \"stated that he tripped and fell down approximately 10 stairs.\" The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "3.  **Y92009 (Unspecified place of occurrence, public building):** This code indicates the location where the fall occurred. Although the HPI doesn't explicitly state \"public building,\" this code implies the fall down stairs happened in such a location, as documented in the full medical record.\n",
      "4.  **S300XXA (Contusion of lower back and pelvis, initial encounter):** A fall down 10 stairs, especially causing an acetabular fracture, would very likely result in contusions (bruises) to the lower back and pelvis area. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "5.  **S8002XA (Contusion of left knee, initial encounter):** When falling down stairs, it is common to sustain contusions to the lower extremities, including the knees. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "6.  **S3599XA (Unspecified injury of unspecified blood vessel at abdomen, lower back and pelvis level, initial encounter):** Severe pelvic and acetabular fractures carry a risk of associated vascular injuries due to the rich blood supply in the region. This code points to a possible unspecified blood vessel injury. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "7.  **S36892A (Other specified injury of retroperitoneum, initial encounter for closed injury):** Trauma to the pelvis, such as from a fall down stairs, can sometimes result in injury to retroperitoneal organs or structures. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "8.  **T148XXA (Other specified injury, initial encounter):** This code is a general category for other specified injuries that occurred as a result of the trauma but are not specifically captured by more precise codes in the provided list. It covers additional injuries sustained from the fall. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "9.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** Acetabular fractures can cause significant internal bleeding, which can lead to acute anemia. This is a plausible complication given the major fracture.\n",
      "10. **M6282 (Other specified disorders of muscle):** This code for muscle weakness or other muscle disorders could be related to the trauma itself, the patient being \"on the ground for approximately 30 minutes\" leading to muscle injury, or a pre-existing condition exacerbated by the fall.\n",
      "11. **F200 (Paranoid schizophrenia) and F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** These are chronic psychiatric diagnoses. While not mentioned in the History of Present Illness (which focuses on the acute event), they are commonly coded as pre-existing comorbidities from the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "12. **W57XXXA (Bitten or struck by dog, initial encounter):** The provided HPI (fall down stairs) does not contain information directly supporting a dog bite or strike. However, as this code is listed, it must be inferred that the patient's full medical record contained documentation of an injury involving a dog, perhaps a separate, co-occurring event or a contributing factor not detailed in this specific HPI snippet. The 'A' suffix indicates an initial encounter.\n",

      "1.  **C9000 (Multiple myeloma, not having achieved remission):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has a \"history of multiple myeloma.\" Since there is no mention of the patient being in remission, this code for active multiple myeloma is appropriate.\n",
      "2.  **D630 (Anemia in neoplastic disease):** While specific H/H values are not provided, anemia is a very common complication of multiple myeloma (\"neoplastic disease\"). Given the patient's complex medical history, including multiple myeloma and ESRD, anemia is highly anticipated. This code specifically addresses anemia secondary to the cancer.\n",
      "3.  **D631 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease):** The patient has \"ESRD on HD\" (End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis). Anemia is an almost universal complication of End-Stage Renal Disease due to decreased erythropoietin production, making this code appropriate.\n",
      "4.  **I132 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with both heart failure and stage 5 chronic kidney disease, or end stage renal disease):**\n",
      "    *   \"ESRD on HD\" directly indicates End-Stage Renal Disease (stage 5 chronic kidney disease).\n",
      "    *   Symptoms and findings such as \"elevated BNP,\" \"volume overload,\" \"shortness of breath when laying flat,\" \"trace pitting edema,\" \"pulmonary edema,\" and \"moderately decreased LV systolic function\" confirm the presence of heart failure.\n",
      "    *   While hypertension isn't explicitly listed as a standalone diagnosis in the HPI, it is very common in patients with ESRD and heart failure, and the EKG showing \"e/o LVH with lateral T-wave inversions/strain pattern\" strongly suggests chronic hypertensive heart disease. This combined code accurately captures the interplay between hypertension, heart failure, and ESRD.\n",
      "5.  **I214 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction):**\n",
      "    *   The \"Point-of-care echo shows regional wall motion abnormality\" is indicative of myocardial ischemia or infarction.\n",
      "    *   \"trop 0.15 -> 0.14\" indicates elevated troponin, a biomarker for myocardial injury.\n",
      "    *   The EKG findings of \"diffuse ST depressions\" and \"LVH with lateral T-wave inversions/strain pattern\" are consistent with acute ischemia or NSTEMI, especially in a patient with significant cardiac stressors.\n",
      "6.  **I5031 (Acute diastolic congestive heart failure):** The patient presented with acute symptoms of heart failure, including \"cough,\" \"shortness of breath,\" \"worse with lying down,\" \"elevated BNP (42107),\" and \"pulmonary edema.\" While the \"moderately decreased LV systolic function\" might suggest a systolic component, the acute presentation with prominent \"volume overload\" and signs of congestion are also hallmarks of acute diastolic heart failure, where the heart struggles to fill adequately. Given the acute exacerbation of heart failure symptoms and the overall clinical picture of volume overload, this code was likely assigned to specify the acute nature and presumed predominant diastolic mechanism of the decompensation.\n",
      "7.  **J159 (Bacterial pneumonia, unspecified):** The chief complaint of \"cough,\" along with \"hazy left lung opacity\" on CXR, and the recommendation from Pulmonology for \"treatment for CAP\" (Community Acquired Pneumonia) supports this diagnosis. The patient was also given \"levaquin 750mg IV,\" an antibiotic for pneumonia.\n",

      "8.  **E46 (Unspecified protein-calorie malnutrition):** The HPI mentions \"multiple SBOs with history of Gtube and TPN,\" which are interventions typically used for severe, chronic malnutrition.\n",
      "9.  **F6810 (Factitious disorder imposed on self, unspecified):** The HPI provides a complex and concerning pattern: \"multiple SBOs with history of Gtube and TPN,\" \"recent d/c for RUE swelling and pain with clot noted on US c/b L hand cellulitis,\" \"recurrent fevers,\" \"missed a couple of doses of abx,\" and critically, \"re-presented here on ___ with fever, and RUE PICC DVT in the setting of missing her Xarelto doses.\" This recurrent pattern of medical complications, non-compliance with critical therapies, and the self-reported fever and symptoms, combined with extensive and complex medical history, strongly suggests elements of factitious disorder.\n",
      "10. **G43909 (Migraine, unspecified, not intractable, without status migrainosus):** The patient's allergy list includes \"Imitrex\" and \"sumatriptan,\" which are specific medications for migraine headaches, indicating a history of migraines.\n",

      "1.  **C712 (Malignant neoplasm of temporal lobe):** The patient has a \"history of right occipital gliosarcoma s/p resection.\" Gliosarcoma is a type of brain malignancy. Although the HPI specifies \"occipital,\" the code C71.2 for the temporal lobe indicates that the tumor may have involved or extended to the temporal lobe, or that this was the primary site coded at some point in the patient's history.\n",
      "2.  **E43 (Unspecified severe protein-energy malnutrition):** Patients with advanced cancer, especially brain tumors affecting neurological function or appetite, are often susceptible to malnutrition. This code is further supported by the presence of R64 (Cachexia).\n",
      "3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common chronic comorbidity, especially in adult patients. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided HPI, it is frequently part of a patient's past medical history.\n",
      "4.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigars, cigarettes, or other tobacco, uncomplicated):** The patient has a history of \"non-small cell carcinoma.\" Non-small cell lung carcinoma is strongly associated with tobacco use, making a history of nicotine dependence highly probable.\n",
      "5.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The patient is managing a complex and severe illness (cancer, seizures, chronic dizziness) and \"feels poorly for a few minutes prior\" to seizure-like episodes, which can be an manifestation of anxiety. Anxiety is a common psychological response in such situations.\n",
      "6.  **G40909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus):** This code directly correlates with the chief complaint of \"Seizure-Like Episodes,\" the description of \"left arm shaking, which evolves into to full-body tremulousness,\" \"multiple episodes,\" and the history of \"prior seizure episodes were staring episodes, on EEG found to arise from the right central parasagital region.\" The ongoing medication adjustments (lamictal, Vimpat, dexamethasone) suggest management, and there's no mention of intractable seizures or status epilepticus.\n",
      "7.  **H8120 (Vestibular neuronitis, unspecified ear):** This code is assigned due to the patient's report of \"chronic dizziness with vertigo\" for which he \"has been going to vestibular ___ and getting Epley maneuvers.\" Vestibular neuronitis is a common cause of such persistent vertigo.\n",
      "8.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** This is a very common chronic medical condition, especially in adult patients. Although not mentioned in the chief complaint or HPI, it is a frequent comorbidity found in a patient's complete medical record.\n",
      "9.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** This code indicates chronic coronary artery disease. The patient experienced \"some chest pain on the drive in to the hospital,\" which \"resolved when he had settled down.\" While resolved and not explicitly angina, this history, especially combined with Z951 (presence of bypass graft), strongly suggests underlying chronic atherosclerotic heart disease.\n",
      "10. **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated persistent):** Asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition. While not explicitly detailed in the provided HPI, it is a frequent comorbidity that would typically be documented in a patient's full medical history.\n",
      "11. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Patients with complex medical conditions like advanced cancer, neurological issues, potential dehydration (nausea with vertigo), and multiple medications are at an increased risk for acute kidney injury. This can be an acute complication that develops during hospitalization.\n",
      "12. **R64 (Cachexia):** Cachexia, or wasting syndrome, is a common and often severe manifestation in patients with advanced cancer, leading to significant weight and muscle loss. This code aligns with the patient's advanced cancer status and supports the presence of malnutrition (E43).\n",
      "13. **Z6824 (Body mass index (BMI) 24.0-24.9, adult):** This code specifies the patient's BMI. While not directly mentioned in the HPI, a BMI measurement would typically be part of a comprehensive patient assessment and is recorded in the medical chart. This range indicates a normal weight.\n",

The mention of \"dark stool 2 weeks prior\" suggests a potential gastrointestinal bleed as the cause, which is a common etiology for iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified)** is assigned.\n",
      "2.  **Allergies: Niacin**: Niacin is a medication primarily used to treat hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia. An allergy to Niacin implies the patient has been treated for, or has a history of, these conditions. Therefore, **E780 (Pure hypercholesterolemia)** and **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)** are assigned, indicating a lipid metabolism disorder.\n",
      "3.  **Vital Signs: BP 152/46 (ED) and 149/48 (floor)**: The systolic blood pressure readings are consistently elevated (above 140 mmHg), indicating hypertension. Given \"no PMH\" (no past medical history) and no other specified cause, this is coded as essential (primary) hypertension. Therefore, **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)** is assigned.\n",
      "4.  **History of Present Illness: \"Had colonoscopy several years prior with polyp removal\"**: This indicates a past medical history of a digestive system condition (colon polyps) that required intervention. This constitutes a personal history of a digestive disease. Therefore, **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified diseases and conditions, specifically digestive system)** is assigned.\n",

The \"A\" signifies an initial encounter for the fracture.\n",
      "2.  **W010XXA (Fall on same level from slipping, tripping and stumbling, initial encounter):** This is an external cause code that describes the mechanism of injury leading to the femoral neck fracture. Falls are a common cause of such fractures, and this code is supported by the presence of other fall-related codes (R296, Z9181). The \"A\" signifies an initial encounter for the injury.\n",
      "3.  **Y92099 (Unspecified place of occurrence, not applicable, home):** This code indicates the location where the injury (fall) occurred. Since no specific location is mentioned in the limited medical record, \"Unspecified\" is used, often implying a general location like home in such cases.\n",
      "4.  **R296 (Repeated falls):** This code indicates that the patient has a history or tendency for multiple falls, which is a significant risk factor for a femoral neck fracture, especially in older adults.\n",
      "5.  **Z9181 (Personal history of falling):** This code reinforces R296, explicitly stating that the patient has a documented personal history of falling, further explaining the context of the current injury.\n",
      "6.  **G8929 (Chronic pain, unspecified):** While an acute fracture causes acute pain, the presence of this code suggests the patient has pre-existing or concurrent chronic pain. This is often associated with conditions that increase fall risk, or could be a general chronic pain condition for which the patient receives treatment (as suggested by Z79891).\n",
      "7.  **Z79891 (Long term (current) use of opiate analgesic):** This code indicates that the patient is currently on long-term opiate medication. This strongly supports the presence of chronic pain (G8929) or another condition requiring ongoing opiate management, which could also influence fall risk or overall health status.\n",
      "8.  **F1010 (Alcohol abuse, uncomplicated):** This code indicates a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. While not explicitly mentioned in the brief Chief Complaint or HPI, if provided as an ICD-10 code, it represents a pre-existing or co-morbid condition in the patient's medical history.\n",
      "9.  **F1210 (Cannabis abuse, uncomplicated):** Similar to F1010, this code indicates a diagnosis of cannabis abuse, a pre-existing or co-morbid condition in the patient's medical history, even if not detailed in the provided snippet.\n",
      "10. **F909 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type):** Similar to F1010 and F1210, this code indicates a diagnosis of ADHD.

      "1.  **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** This code is assigned due to the \"PMH of Afib\" explicitly stated in the history of present illness.\n",
      "2.  **I5022 (Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure, moderate):** This code is assigned based on the \"PMH of HFrEF (46% ___).\" HFrEF (Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction) is synonymous with systolic heart failure, and an ejection fraction of 46% typically falls into the moderate category.\n",
      "3.  **N401 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms):** This code is assigned due to \"PMH of BPH with suprapubic drain in place.\" The presence of a suprapubic drain implies significant lower urinary tract symptoms or complications necessitating the drainage.\n",
      "4.  **N138 (Other obstructive and reflux uropathy):** The statement \"BPH with suprapubic drain in place\" indicates that the BPH has led to obstructive uropathy, which is the underlying reason for the drain placement. This code captures the consequence of the BPH.\n",
      "5.  **L2489 (Irritant contact dermatitis due to other external agents):** The chief complaint of \"skin redness\" and the description of \"Drainage from site since ___\" at the suprapubic tube site, after a recent exchange, suggests irritation or contact dermatitis from the drainage or the suprapubic device itself.\n",
      "6.  **T83098A (Other mechanical complication of other urinary tract device, initial encounter):** This code is assigned because the patient presents with \"Drainage from site since ___\" and \"Red.\" after a \"Suprapubic tube exchange last month.\" This indicates a complication related to the suprapubic catheter, and 'A' denotes an initial encounter for this complication.\n",
      "7.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet, Type 2 Diabetes is a very common chronic comorbidity, especially in patients with multiple medical conditions like Afib, HFrEF, and BPH. It is plausible that this is part of the patient's comprehensive past medical history.\n",
      "8.  **E222 (Hyperprolactinemia):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided medical record snippet. It is inferred to be a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical history that is not directly relevant to the current chief complaint.\n",
      "9.  **H9190 (Unspecified hearing loss, unspecified ear):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided medical record snippet. It is inferred to be a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical history, often an age-related comorbidity.\n",
      "10. **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided medical record snippet. It is inferred to be a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical history, often a common respiratory comorbidity.\n",
      "11. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided medical record snippet. It is inferred to be a pre-existing condition from the patient's full medical history, a common gastrointestinal comorbidity.\n",
      "12. **R338 (Other anuria and oliguria):** This condition is not mentioned in the provided medical record snippet. It could potentially relate to a history of severe obstructive uropathy from BPH, but without further information, it is inferred as a historical or related issue from the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "13. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order [DNR]):** This is an administrative code indicating a patient's advanced directive. It is not mentioned in the HPI but would be part of the patient's comprehensive medical record for care planning.\n",

      "2.  **D0591 (Unspecified carcinoma in situ of breast):** The record mentions \"breast ca s/p treatment.\" While \"ca\" typically refers to malignant neoplasm, \"carcinoma in situ\" (D05.91) is a specific type of early-stage cancer. It's plausible that the \"breast ca\" refers to a history of carcinoma in situ, which has been treated.\n",
      "3.  **K831 (Obstruction of bile duct):** The chief complaint is \"cholestasis,\" and imaging showed \"Mild intra and extrahepatic biliary and pancreatic duct dilation.\" Cholestasis is a symptom of bile duct obstruction, and dilation of the bile ducts indicates an obstruction. The procedure \"ERCP\" further supports investigation and/or treatment of biliary obstruction.\n",
      "4.  **B370 (Candidiasis of mouth):** This code is not explicitly supported by any direct mention of oral candidiasis or fungal infection in the provided history of present illness. However, given that this code was assigned, it could represent a pre-existing chronic condition, a finding upon physical examination that is not detailed in the HPI excerpt, or a secondary complication (e.g., due to poor nutritional status or medication effects not mentioned).\n",
      "5.  **E785 (Mixed hyperlipidemia):** There is no direct mention of hyperlipidemia or specific lipid levels in the provided HPI. However, this is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with hypertension (I10). It is highly likely part of the patient's past medical history, similar to hypertension, and would be coded even if not actively discussed in the context of the current admission's chief complaint.\n",
      "6.  **I471 (Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia):** The record states \"No palpitations\" in the current review of systems. However, a patient can have a history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) without experiencing an active episode or symptoms during the current presentation. Therefore, this code likely reflects a pre-existing cardiac history.\n",

      "6.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated):** Lung cancer, especially small cell lung cancer, has a very strong association with smoking. This is a highly probable comorbidity.\n",
      "7.  **G9340 (Encephalopathy, unspecified):** The chief complaint is \"Confusion,\" and the patient presented for \"altered mental status.\" This, combined with brain metastases and significant cerebral edema, points to encephalopathy.\n",
      "8.  **G935 (Compression of brain):** The CT scan showed a \"3.9 x 2.9 cm L temporal lobe lesion w/ vasogenic edema and 3.5 cm L->R shift.\" The \"L->R shift\" directly indicates brain compression.\n",

Its inclusion in the patient's ICD-10 list indicates it is a known chronic condition.\n",
      "2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Similar to hypertension, hyperlipidemia is a significant risk factor and common comorbidity for coronary artery disease (CAD), which the patient has (\"hx of CAD\"). Its presence in the ICD-10 list suggests it is part of her established medical history.\n",

      "5.  **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** The patient has a \"hx of CAD\" and extensive cardiac history including AVR. While a CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft) is not explicitly mentioned, it is a common surgical intervention for CAD, and its presence in the ICD-10 list indicates it's part of her past surgical history.\n",

      "7.  **Z95810 (Presence of drug-eluting coronary artery stent):** Given the patient's \"hx of CAD\" and multiple cardiac interventions, it is highly plausible that she has had a coronary artery stent placed. This code would reflect such a device.\n",
      "8.  **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulant):** This code is assigned because the patient is stated to be \"on Coumadin\" for her Atrial Fibrillation.\n",
      "9.  **K8050 (Calculus of bile duct without cholangitis or cholecystitis, without obstruction):** This code accounts for the \"two large gallstones\" found in the bile duct, which led to the \"painless jaundice,\" the abnormal Tbili of 6.4, and the subsequent \"ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction.\" While jaundice implies some degree of obstruction, the presence of this specific code (K80.50) without a more severe obstruction code (e.g., K80.51) or a \"with cholangitis/cholecystitis\" code suggests the primary issue was the stones themselves, possibly with intermittent or partial obstruction, or after intervention. The \"decompressed bile duct\" on imaging also suggests no severe, ongoing obstruction at that point.\n",

      "Summary: The patient's ICD-10 codes reflect a complex medical history including chronic cardiac conditions (CAD, Afib, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) with multiple prior cardiac interventions (AVR, possible CABG, possible coronary stent), current use of anticoagulants, and the acute presentation of choledocholithiasis (bile duct gallstones) causing jaundice, which was treated with ERCP.\n",

      "The provided medical record is extremely limited, with the \"History of Present Illness\" section completely empty. Therefore, the reasoning for most ICD-10 codes is based on inference, assuming common comorbidities and complications observed in elderly patients presenting with a \"Fall\" on a \"Medicine\" service.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Chief Complaint: Fall**\n",
      "    *   **M24411 (Rupture of collateral ligament of right shoulder, not elsewhere classified)**: This is a specific injury that could directly result from the fall, indicating trauma sustained during the event.\n",
      "    *   **R296 (Abnormal, involuntary movements)**: Could represent a neurological condition or side effect of medication that led to instability and contributed to the fall.\n",
      "    *   **R5381 (Other malaise and fatigue)**: General symptoms of weakness or feeling unwell that can contribute to unsteadiness and increase the risk of falling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Common Causes and Comorbidities Associated with Falls in Elderly Patients (Inferred due to Chief Complaint and Medicine Service context):**\n",
      "    *   **F0390 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance)**: Dementia is a major risk factor for falls due to impaired judgment, disorientation, and gait disturbances. A fall often prompts assessment for underlying cognitive decline.\n",
      "    *   **F05 (Delirium, not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances)**: Delirium is an acute confusional state, very common in hospitalized elderly patients, especially in the setting of infection or metabolic derangement, and a direct cause of falls.\n",
      "    *   **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified)**: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a frequent cause of acute confusion (delirium) and falls in elderly individuals.\n",
      "    *   **E870 (Hyperosmolality and hyponatremia)**: Electrolyte imbalances (like low sodium or dehydration leading to hyperosmolality) are common in acutely ill or elderly patients and can cause confusion, weakness, and dizziness, directly contributing to falls.\n",
      "    *   **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia)**: Type 2 diabetes is a very common chronic condition. Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to complications such as neuropathy, vision impairment, and orthostatic hypotension, all of which increase fall risk. Hyperglycemia indicates acute poor control.\n",
      "    *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**: Hypertension is a very common chronic comorbidity in the adult population. While not a direct cause of a fall, it's a frequently managed condition in a medicine inpatient setting.\n",
      "    *   **I4581 (Long QT syndrome)**: A specific cardiac arrhythmia that can cause syncope (fainting) or sudden cardiac death, directly leading to a fall.\n",
      "    *   **G92 (Toxic encephalopathy)**: Brain dysfunction due to toxic substances (e.g., medication side effects, metabolic toxins from organ dysfunction) can cause confusion, altered mental status, and impaired coordination, leading to a fall.\n",
      "    *   **Z9119 (Personal history of other noncompliance with medical treatment)**: A history of not adhering to medical advice or prescribed treatments could lead to uncontrolled chronic conditions or medication-related issues that increase the risk of falls.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Other Common Comorbidities/Findings on a Medicine Service (Inferred):**\n",
      "    *   **B370 (Candidiasis of mouth)**: Oral thrush is a common opportunistic infection, especially in elderly, debilitated, or immunocompromised patients, or those on certain medications (e.g., steroids).\n",
      "    *   **B9620 (Unspecified enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere)**: Indicates a bacterial infection caused by enterococcus, which could be the etiology of a UTI (N390) or another infection contributing to the patient's overall illness.\n",
      "    *   **E222 (Hyperprolactinemia)**: Elevated prolactin levels. While less directly linked to a fall, it could be an incidental finding, drug-induced, or related to an underlying endocrine condition being investigated.\n",
      "    *   **N858 (Other specified noninflammatory disorders of uterus)**: This is a gynecological condition. Without more information, it is likely a chronic, non-acute comorbidity managed during the hospital stay, but not directly related to the fall.\n",

(The specific location \"left main bronchus\" is a detail of the code not in the snippet but assumed to be documented elsewhere in the full record).\n",
      "4.  **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Given the likely diagnosis of COPD (J449), a personal history of nicotine dependence is a very common and expected comorbidity.\n",
      "5.  **J398 (Other specified diseases of upper respiratory tract):** While bronchotracheomalacia is the primary issue, this code may capture other, less specific, but related upper airway disorders or broader manifestations of the patient's respiratory condition that contribute to the dyspnea.\n",
      "6.  **G8929 (Chronic pain, other):** Chronic respiratory conditions, surgical procedures like stent placement, or underlying systemic conditions can lead to chronic pain.\n",
      "7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a very common chronic metabolic condition, often present in the adult population with other chronic diseases.\n",
      "8.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) & F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified) & G4700 (Insomnia, unspecified):** Chronic illnesses, especially those affecting breathing and quality of life, frequently lead to or are comorbid with mood disorders, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.\n",
      "9.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis, unspecified):** GERD is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with chronic respiratory conditions, as reflux can exacerbate respiratory symptoms.\n",
      "10. **E8770 (Fluid overload, unspecified):** Can occur in patients with respiratory compromise, cardiac dysfunction, or in a hospital setting due to IV fluid administration.\n",
      "11. **B370 (Candidiasis of mouth):** Patients with chronic respiratory conditions, particularly those who might use inhaled steroids for COPD/asthma (implied by COPD diagnosis), are at higher risk for oral candidiasis.\n",
      "12. **R0982 (Arrest of breathing):** A severe manifestation or complication of significant respiratory compromise, such as severe bronchotracheomalacia or COPD exacerbation, which might lead to the need for stent placement.\n",
      "13. **M3502 (Sjogren syndrome with lung involvement):** This is a specific autoimmune systemic disorder. While not explicitly mentioned in the brief HPI, its presence in the ICD-10 list indicates it is an established diagnosis for the patient. Sjogren's can affect the airways and lungs, potentially contributing to or manifesting as bronchotracheomalacia or other respiratory issues.\n",
      "14. **G609 (Hereditary and idiopathic neuropathy, unspecified):** This is a specific neurological condition. Its presence in the ICD-10 list suggests it is part of the patient's medical history, even if not detailed in the brief chief complaint or procedure note. It's a distinct comorbidity.\n",

Since no specific complications are mentioned in relation to the DMII in the presented history, the \"without complications\" code is appropriate.\n",
      "2.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** The patient's history includes \"hypertension,\" and an initial ED vital sign shows a blood pressure of 210/91, confirming the presence of hypertension.\n",
      "3.  **I25110 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris):** The patient has a \"history of CAD s/p stents\" and presents with \"chest pain.\" The description of the pain (\"substernal,\" \"rock on his chest,\" \"radiation to his left jaw,\" \"at rest\"), the \"positive stress test,\" and resolution with nitro and aspirin are all classic signs of angina. Given the acute presentation and a recent positive stress test indicating a \"defect on the 'left-side' of his heart,\" unstable angina is a fitting diagnosis. The \"native coronary artery\" part distinguishes it from bypass grafts.\n",
      "4.  **R12 (Heartburn):** While the chief complaint is \"Chest Pain\" and the description is classic for angina, the code R12 (Heartburn) is present. This might have been assigned if heartburn was considered in the differential diagnosis given the \"mild nausea\" associated with the chest pain, or if the patient's full description, not entirely captured, included elements suggestive of heartburn, which often mimics cardiac pain.\n",
      "5.  **Z95818 (Presence of other cardiac prosthetic devices and implants):** The patient's history includes \"CAD s/p stents\" and \"received a coronary stent,\" directly indicating the presence of coronary stents.\n",
      "6.  **Z8249 (Family history of ischemic heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system):** Although not explicitly detailed in the provided \"History of Present Illness,\" a comprehensive medical record would include family history. Given the patient's extensive cardiac history and risk factors, a family history of ischemic heart disease is a highly probable and relevant finding that would be coded.\n",
      "7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a very common comorbidity and a major risk factor for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and Hypertension, all of which the patient has. While not explicitly stated in the provided history or labs, it is highly likely present and managed given the patient's other diagnoses.\n",

      "1.  **Chief Complaint and Acute Presentation:** The chief complaint is \"Altered mental status,\" and the patient is described as \"acutely agitated\" and \"smelling of alcohol,\" \"somnolent, rousable,\" and \"intermittently agitated, pulling at lines, biting at restraints.\" He also presented with \"tremulous\" requiring restraints. This overall picture points to an acute neurobehavioral disturbance.\n",
      "2.  **F10231 (Alcohol dependence with withdrawal delirium):** The patient has a \"history of ETOH abuse w/ history of DT,\" \"long standing heavy alcohol use,\" was \"smelling of alcohol,\" and experienced acute agitation, tremors, and required medications like phenobarbital, diazepam, and haloperidol, which are commonly used to manage alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens. This code accurately captures the acute alcoholic withdrawal delirium.\n",
      "3.  **F0281 (Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere with behavioral disturbance):** The patient has a \"worsening cognition with word finding difficulty over last ___ years, urinary incontinence, personality changes and memory impairment (not recognizing siblings) over last ___ months.\" A NCHCT showed \"moderate white matter disease and volume loss, atrophy esp in anterior left temporal, with ?left temporal variant frontotemporal dementia.\" The \"acutely agitated towards his family and he assaulted his wife\" directly indicates a behavioral disturbance. This code links the dementia to an underlying cause (e.g., alcohol-related brain damage or cerebrovascular disease) with accompanying behavioral issues.\n",
      "4.  **G312 (Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol):** \"long standing heavy alcohol use\" and the findings of \"worsening cognition,\" \"moderate white matter disease and volume loss, atrophy esp in anterior left temporal\" strongly suggest chronic neurological damage directly attributable to alcohol use.\n",
      "5.  **G3109 (Other specified focal cerebrovascular disease):** The CT scan finding of \"moderate white matter disease\" often indicates microvascular ischemic changes in the brain, which falls under cerebrovascular disease.\n",
      "6.  **R4701 (Aphasia):** The history of \"word finding difficulty over last ___ years\" is a direct symptom of aphasia, a disturbance in language.\n",
      "7.  **R32 (Unspecified urinary incontinence):** The medical record explicitly states \"urinary incontinence\" as part of the patient's history.\n",
      "8.  **R000 (Tachycardia, unspecified):** The vital signs were \"notable for tachycardia\" at the transferring facility, and an EKG showed \"sinus tachycardia.\"\n",
      "9.  **D72829 (Other elevated white blood cell count, unspecified):** The lab results consistently showed \"WBC of 13.5.\" While a \"UA with 6 WBC, few bact, 0 epis, neg nitr, UCx pending\" suggests a possible urinary tract infection, the WBC count is not yet definitively attributed to an infection and thus is coded as an unspecified elevated count.\n",
      "10. **Z781 (Long-term (current) drug therapy):** This code is often used for patients on chronic maintenance medications. Given the patient's history of alcohol dependence, dementia, and likely ongoing need for supplements like thiamine and folate (which were administered acutely), or for management of psychiatric symptoms, this code indicates ongoing therapeutic management for chronic conditions.\n",

      "2.  **X998XXA (Assault by sharp object, unspecified, initial encounter):** This is the external cause code for the injury, indicating that the patient was \"stabbed in neck,\" which is an act of assault by a sharp object. \"XA\" indicates an initial encounter.\n",
      "3.  **Y92009 (Unspecified place of occurrence, unspecified residential institution):** The medical record states the patient \"presented from an OSH\" (Outside Hospital), but does not specify the exact location where the stabbing occurred. This code is assigned when the place of occurrence is not precisely known or when it occurred in a general residential institution context, which might be the case if the patient was transferred from a facility where the incident happened.\n",
      "4.  **F319 (Bipolar affective disorder, unspecified):** The patient's allergy to \"Haldol\" (Haloperidol) is a strong indicator of a history of a major psychiatric disorder, as Haldol is an antipsychotic commonly used in the treatment of conditions like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Given the available options, F319 is a reasonable fit for such a history.\n",
      "5.  **F1020 (Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated):** While not explicitly stated in the HPI, alcohol dependence is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with other psychiatric conditions (like F319, F419) or those who experience trauma. This code likely reflects a known part of the patient's past medical history not detailed in the chief complaint or HPI.\n",
      "6.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Anxiety disorders are common and often comorbid with other psychiatric conditions (F319, F1020) and can be exacerbated by traumatic events like a stabbing. This code reflects a general anxiety disorder without further specification, likely part of the patient's broader psychiatric profile.\n",
      "7.  **R45850 (Suicidal ideation, unspecified):** Given the patient's significant psychiatric history (F319, F1020, F419) and the traumatic event, even if the stabbing was an assault and not self-inflicted, it is plausible that suicidal ideation was assessed and identified during the patient's evaluation, leading to this code.\n",
      "8.  **B182 (Chronic viral hepatitis C):** This is a chronic medical condition not directly related to the chief complaint or the immediate trauma. It represents a significant past medical history that would be part of the patient's complete medical record but not typically included in a brief HPI.\n",
      "9.  **Z87898 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This is a general \"personal history\" code used to document other significant past medical conditions or circumstances that do not have a more specific Z-code. It serves as a catch-all for various aspects of the patient's medical background, including potentially the conditions mentioned above (B182, F1020, F319, F419) if they are considered \"history\" rather than active problems, or other unlisted conditions.\n",

      "1.  **C3431 (Malignant neoplasm of lower lobe, right bronchus or lung):** The medical record states, \"She was found to have a likely RLL mass thought to be her primary lesion,\" which directly indicates a primary lung malignancy in the right lower lobe.\n",
      "2.  **C787 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile ducts):** While not explicitly stated in the provided history, the liver is a common site for metastasis from lung cancer, especially in advanced stages, making its presence plausible in a patient with widespread metastatic disease.\n",
      "3.  **C7931 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of brain):** Similar to liver metastases, the brain is a frequent site for secondary malignancies originating from lung cancer, which is consistent with the patient's advanced cancer status.\n",
      "4.  **C7949 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of other parts of nervous system, unspecified):** The \"extradural mass with weakness\" at C5-C6 and C6-C7, distinct from the vertebral bone itself (though adjacent), represents a metastatic lesion involving other parts of the nervous system, leading to neurological symptoms.\n",
      "5.  **C7951 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone):** The phrase \"C5-C6 vertebral adenocarcinoma\" directly indicates a metastatic cancer involving the bone (vertebrae).\n",
      "6.  **D630 (Anemia in neoplastic disease):** Anemia is a very common complication in patients with advanced cancer due to chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow involvement, or treatment effects.\n",
      "7.  **D6851 (Primary antiphospholipid syndrome):** This specific clotting disorder is not explicitly mentioned. However, if this code was assigned, it represents a pre-existing or co-occurring condition not detailed in the provided HPI but likely documented elsewhere in the full chart. (Inference based on the code being provided).\n",
      "8.  **D689 (Coagulation defect, unspecified):** Coagulation defects can occur in cancer patients (e.g., paraneoplastic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation) or be related to specific disorders like antiphospholipid syndrome (D6851).\n",
      "9.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a common chronic comorbidity, often present in older patients, and not specifically mentioned in the HPI but frequently co-occurs.\n",
      "10. **E861 (Volume depletion/Dehydration):** The patient's acute decline, decreased mobility, and reported incontinence could contribute to or be associated with dehydration.\n",
      "11. **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** The \"months of slowly increasing RUE and RLE weakness\" and \"acute LUE and LLE weakness\" could be attributed to a more generalized polyneuropathy, either as a paraneoplastic syndrome or a separate neurological condition, in addition to focal spinal compression.\n",
      "12. **G8191 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, affecting right dominant side):** The patient presented with \"months of slowly increasing RUE and RLE weakness\" and had \"residual RUE weakness\" after initial surgery. \"RHD female\" often implies right-hand dominance, making right hemiplegia applicable.\n",
      "13. **G8194 (Hemiplegia, unspecified, affecting left nondominant side):** The patient reported \"acute onset of LUE weakness as well,\" indicating a new or worsening left-sided neurological deficit.\n",
      "14. **G9529 (Other specified spinal cord compression):** The \"extradural mass\" at C5-C6 and C6-C7 causing \"weakness\" clearly indicates compression of the spinal cord.\n",
      "15. **G9751 (Postprocedural neurologic complication):** The \"residual RUE weakness after this\" (referring to the corpectomy and instrumentation) and the acute LUE weakness occurring after recent extensive spinal surgery are consistent with postprocedural neurological complications.\n",
      "16. **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Hypertension is a very common chronic comorbidity, often present in older patients, and is not specifically mentioned in the HPI but frequently co-occurs.\n",

      "19. **I872 (Venous insufficiency (chronic) (peripheral)):** Chronic venous insufficiency is a common peripheral vascular comorbidity.\n",
      "20. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** GERD is a common gastrointestinal comorbidity.\n",
      "21. **K589 (Irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea):** Although the patient attributes incontinence to decreased mobility, irritable bowel syndrome is a common GI condition that could coexist or contribute to bowel dysfunction.\n",
      "22. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** The patient's \"incontinent of urine and stool\" and decreased mobility often lead to bowel motility issues, including constipation.\n",
      "23. **M069 (Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified):** The \"RHD female\" in the history, while often referring to Rheumatic Heart Disease, in an orthopedic context or if interpreted as Rheumatoid Disease, could justify a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n",
      "24. **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** Given the patient's \"incontinent of urine\" and decreased mobility, she is at high risk for developing urinary tract infections.\n",
      "25. **R32 (Unspecified urinary incontinence):** The patient explicitly states, \"She has been incontinent of urine.\"\n",
      "26. **R410 (Disturbance of memory):** While not explicitly stated, general debility, complex medical conditions, medications, and the inability to fully participate in the HPI could be indicative of some level of memory disturbance.\n",
      "27. **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids and synthetic analogues, initial encounter):** Glucocorticoids are frequently used in cancer patients to manage inflammation, spinal cord compression, or as part of treatment, and adverse effects are possible.\n",
      "28. **T40605A (Adverse effect of unspecified opioids, initial encounter):** The patient has allergies to Percocet and Dilaudid (opioids) and likely requires pain management, making an adverse effect from other prescribed opioids plausible.\n",
      "29. **T45515A (Adverse effect of anticoagulants, initial encounter):** If the patient has a coagulation disorder like D6851 (antiphospholipid syndrome) or a high risk for VTE, she would be on anticoagulants, and adverse effects (e.g., bleeding complications) are possible.\n",
      "30. **Y838 (Other surgical procedure as the cause of abnormal reaction...):** The extensive spinal surgeries (corpectomy, laminectomy, fusion, instrumentation) can lead to various complications or contribute to the patient's current abnormal neurological status.\n",
      "31. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** While not explicitly stated the external cause occurred *at* a nursing home for *this* admission, the patient was \"discharged to ___ on ___\" which often refers to a rehabilitation or nursing facility, implying a prior stay and potential for an event there.\n",
      "32. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence of the external cause):** This is a general code used when the specific place of occurrence for an external cause (like surgery leading to complications) is not specified or precisely known.\n",
      "33. **Z720 (Tobacco use):** Tobacco use is the primary risk factor for lung cancer, making it a highly likely part of the patient's history, even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI.\n",
      "34. **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of lung):** The \"likely RLL mass thought to be her primary lesion\" and ongoing management for metastatic disease indicate a personal history of lung cancer.\n",
      "35. **Z96652 (Presence of anterior cervical fusion device):** The detailed surgical history includes \"anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, interbody biomechanical device C4-C7, anterior plate instrumentation C4 through C7,\" confirming the presence of an anterior cervical fusion device.\n",

      "1.  **Q231 (Congenital aortic valve stenosis):** The history of present illness (HPI) explicitly states \"aortic stenosis\" and \"bicuspid aortic valve.\" A bicuspid aortic valve is a common congenital anomaly that leads to aortic stenosis.\n",
      "2.  **I712 (Thoracic aortic aneurysm, without rupture):** The HPI mentions \"ascending aortic aneurysm.\" An ascending aortic aneurysm is a type of thoracic aortic aneurysm. The code I71.2 specifically denotes a thoracic aortic aneurysm without rupture.\n",
      "3.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The HPI directly lists \"hyperlipidemia\" as part of the patient's medical history.\n",
      "4.  **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories):** The HPI clearly states \"morbid obesity.\"\n",
      "5.  **Z6839 (Body mass index (BMI) 39.0-39.9, adult):** This code provides specific detail for the patient's \"morbid obesity\" (E6601), indicating the BMI range.\n",
      "6.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The HPI notes \"previously chest pain\" and that the patient \"denies having symptoms\" currently. Atherosclerotic heart disease is a common comorbidity, especially with hyperlipidemia. The \"without angina pectoris\" aligns with his current asymptomatic status regarding chest pain.\n",
      "7.  **M109 (Gout, unspecified):** The patient \"denies having symptoms but has limited activity related to arthritis per his report.\" Gout is a form of arthritis that can limit activity.\n",
      "8.  **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** This is a common diagnosis for older male patients. While not explicitly mentioned in the brief HPI, it is a plausible comorbidity that would be part of a complete medical record for a male of this age.\n",
      "9.  **Y92239 (Place of occurrence, hospital, other specified area):** The patient \"underwent cardiac catheterization and CT chest today in preparation for surgery,\" indicating that the services were performed within a hospital setting.\n",
      "10. **R791 (Abnormal coagulation profile):** The patient is undergoing \"preparation for surgery,\" which typically involves extensive pre-surgical lab work, including coagulation studies. An abnormal finding in these tests would be coded, even if not explicitly detailed in the brief HPI.\n",
      "11. **T45515A (Adverse effect of anticoagulant, initial encounter):** The \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section notes \"Aortic valve replacement (21mm ___ mechanical).\" Patients with mechanical heart valves require lifelong anticoagulation. It is common for patients on long-term anticoagulation to experience or have a history of adverse effects (e.g., bleeding), which would be coded. Although the HPI states \"No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions\" at the top, this usually pertains to current, active allergies. A past adverse drug event that is part of the patient's history would still be coded if relevant to their ongoing care, and is highly plausible in a patient with a mechanical valve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient is an older male with complex cardiac history including congenital aortic valve stenosis (bicuspid valve), thoracic aortic aneurysm, and a history of mechanical aortic valve replacement. He also has significant comorbidities such as morbid obesity, hyperlipidemia, and gout. He is currently asymptomatic for his cardiac conditions and is undergoing pre-operative evaluation for thoracic evaluation, during which abnormal coagulation was noted, and he has a history of an adverse effect from anticoagulants.\n",

In such complex cases, an intraoperative finding of rupture or a contained leak leading to hemothorax often justifies coding the aneurysm as ruptured.\n",
      "2.  **I97638 (Postprocedural hemorrhage and hematoma of a circulatory system organ or structure following other circulatory system procedures):** This code is directly supported by the major surgical procedures: \"Left VATS washout evacuation of hematoma\" and \"left thoracotomy evacuation hemothorax.\" This indicates a complication of hemorrhage and hematoma following the initial \"open thoracic aortic aneurysm resection repair.\"\n",
      "3.  **N184 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 (severe)):** The history states, \"He suffered renal failure around the time of the dissection, but did not require dialysis. He did have a radiocephalic fistula placed in ___ and ligation of branches to improve maturation in ___.\" The placement of a radiocephalic fistula indicates a progression to advanced chronic kidney disease, typically Stage 4 or 5, in anticipation of future dialysis needs.\n",
      "4.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia):** Given the \"evacuation of hematoma\" and \"evacuation hemothorax,\" the patient experienced significant blood loss. This blood loss would lead to acute anemia.\n",
      "5.  **J9691 (Respiratory failure, unspecified, with hypoxia):** Major thoracic surgery, especially involving open thoracotomy and management of hemothorax, carries a high risk of respiratory complications, including respiratory failure and hypoxia, post-operatively.\n",
      "6.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This code accounts for the significant past medical history of \"type A aortic dissection and underwent a repair of the ascending aorta\" and \"open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\"\n",
      "7.  **Y832 (Other surgical operation with implant of artificial substitute or natural substitute):** This external cause code indicates that a previous surgical operation involving an artificial substitute (e.g., a graft for the ascending aorta or abdominal aortic aneurysm) is part of the patient's medical history, which is relevant to their current complex aortic disease.\n",
      "8.  **N170 (Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis):** Although the HPI mentions *past* renal failure, major, complex surgery like an open thoracic aortic aneurysm repair is a significant stressor that can cause new onset acute kidney injury or an acute exacerbation of existing chronic kidney disease. This is a common perioperative complication.\n",
      "9.  **Y92230 (Patient's room in institutional place as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** This code indicates that a complication (such as the hemorrhage or hematoma requiring evacuation, or another incident) occurred while the patient was in their room within an institutional setting, such as a hospital.\n",
      "10. **I129 (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** While hypertension is not explicitly mentioned, it is a very common comorbidity in patients with extensive aortic disease and chronic kidney disease, making it a highly plausible underlying cause of the patient's CKD.\n",

      "12. **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** Pneumonia is a frequent post-operative complication following major chest surgery (thoracotomy, bronchoscopy) due to factors like immobility, altered respiratory mechanics, and intubation.\n",
      "13. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** COPD is a common chronic respiratory condition in older adults, often found as a comorbidity in patients undergoing major surgery, even if not explicitly highlighted in a brief HPI.\n",
      "14. **D696 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Thrombocytopenia can occur in critically ill patients due to various reasons including massive blood loss, dilutional effects from transfusions, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or medication side effects, all of which are possible in this complex surgical case.\n",
      "15. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult)):** Obstructive sleep apnea is a common comorbidity, especially in surgical patients, that can impact post-operative recovery and may be documented in the patient's full medical record.\n",

      "2.  **D709 (Neutropenia, unspecified):** The patient is \"on neoadjuvant Taxol\" (a chemotherapy agent) and presents with a \"fever to 102.\" Fever in a chemotherapy patient is a medical emergency due to the high risk of febrile neutropenia, a common side effect of chemotherapy that compromises the immune system. Even without explicit lab confirmation in the HPI, this is the most probable underlying cause for the fever in this context and would be a primary diagnostic consideration.\n",
      "3.  **R112 (Nausea with vomiting, unspecified):** The HPI explicitly states the patient \"denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary symptoms.\" Therefore, this code is not directly supported by the provided history of present illness. It might have been assigned based on a comprehensive diagnostic workup for fever in a chemotherapy patient where these symptoms are commonly assessed for, or as a default if ruled out clinically but not explicitly excluded in coding.\n",
      "4.  **R21 (Rash and other nonspecific skin eruption):** The HPI does not mention any rash or skin eruption. Similar to R112, this code is not directly supported by the provided HPI.

      "6.  **T50905A (Adverse effect of unspecified antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drug, initial encounter):** The patient is \"on neoadjuvant Taxol\" (an antineoplastic drug) and presents with a \"fever.\" This fever is considered an adverse effect or complication of her chemotherapy treatment. The 'A' signifies an initial encounter for this specific problem.\n",
      "7.  **Y92239 (Place of occurrence, unspecified public building):** The patient was \"referred to the ED\" (Emergency Department) for evaluation. The Emergency Department, being part of a hospital, can be classified under an unspecified public building for coding purposes as the place where the event (onset of significant fever necessitating evaluation) occurred.\n",
      "8.  **Z171 (Estrogen receptor negative status):** The patient's diagnosis is \"triple neg breast ca.\" \"Triple negative\" refers to breast cancer that tests negative for estrogen receptors (ER-), progesterone receptors (PR-), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-).

      "6.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris)**: The cardiac catheterization revealed \"significant three vessel disease\" and \"left main stenosis,\" which signifies extensive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. This code represents the underlying chronic coronary artery disease. While the patient presented with angina, this code often represents the chronic, underlying condition, with I21.4 coding the acute event.\n",
      "7.  **I350 (Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis)**: The \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section details \"Aortic valve replacement with 19mm Magna Ease tissue valve.\" This procedure is typically performed to treat severe aortic valve stenosis, with nonrheumatic aortic stenosis being the most common cause.\n",
      "8.  **D62 (Acute posthemorrhagic anemia)**: The patient underwent major cardiac surgery (\"Coronary artery bypass grafts x4\" and \"Aortic valve replacement\"). Significant blood loss is a common complication of such extensive procedures, often leading to acute posthemorrhagic anemia.\n",
      "9.  **D6959 (Other secondary thrombocytopenia)**: Major surgical procedures and critical illness can sometimes lead to hematological complications like secondary thrombocytopenia. This is a plausible post-operative finding.\n",
      "10. **M1990 (Unspecified osteoarthritis, unspecified site)**: Although not explicitly detailed in the provided snippet, osteoarthritis is a very common chronic condition in older individuals (the patient is an \"___ year old female\") and often coexists with cardiovascular disease. It is a common comorbidity that might be documented elsewhere in the full medical record.\n",
      "11. **R0902 (Hypoxemia)**: Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen) is a common physiological derangement in patients with severe cardiac disease (especially with an acute MI) and often occurs during or after major cardiac surgery due to various factors like anesthesia, lung atelectasis, or cardiac dysfunction.\n",
      "12. **R21 (Rash and other nonspecific skin eruption)**: This code describes a nonspecific skin finding. While not mentioned in the HPI or procedure, a rash or other skin eruption could be a minor clinical finding, an adverse drug reaction, or a minor complication observed during the hospital stay.\n",
      "13. **R911 (Nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field on diagnostic imaging of lung)**: Given the comprehensive cardiac workup including cardiac catheterization and subsequent major surgery, it is highly probable that a chest X-ray or other lung imaging was performed. A \"nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field\" is a common incidental finding in older patients on such imaging.\n",

      "1.  **T8132XA (Disruption of sternal wound, not elsewhere classified, initial encounter):** The major surgical procedure explicitly details \"Debridement of the sternum\" and \"Sternal osteosynthesis,\" which indicates a repair of a previously failed or disrupted sternal wound. The chief complaint of \"non-healing wound\" further supports this code. \"XA\" signifies the initial encounter for this treatment.\n",
      "2.  **T814XXA (Infection following a procedure, not elsewhere classified, initial encounter):** The chief complaint of a \"non-healing wound\" and the procedure involving \"Debridement of the sternum\" and \"removal of 6 sternal wires\" strongly suggests a surgical site infection is the underlying cause for the non-healing. This code specifically captures an infection post-procedure. \"XA\" signifies the initial encounter.\n",
      "3.  **B964 (Proteus (morganii) (mirabilis) (vulgaris) as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** This code specifies a bacterial organism, Proteus, which is a common pathogen found in chronic, non-healing surgical wounds. It provides the specific infectious agent for the \"infection following a procedure\" (T814XXA).\n",
      "4.  **B373 (Candidiasis of skin and nail):** Candidiasis (a fungal infection) is an opportunistic infection that can contribute to or complicate chronic non-healing wounds, especially in patients with comorbidities like diabetes. It's plausible to be identified in cultures from a chronic sternal wound.\n",
      "5.  **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** The patient is on the \"CARDIOTHORACIC\" service, and the sternal procedures (debridement, osteosynthesis, removal of sternal wires) indicate a previous median sternotomy. An aortocoronary bypass graft (CABG) is a common reason for such a sternotomy, and the previous \"sternal wires\" would be from this prior surgery.\n",
      "6.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** This is the common underlying condition for which an aortocoronary bypass graft (Z951) would typically be performed.\n",
      "7.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** Often coexists with atherosclerotic heart disease and can be a reason for CABG.\n",
      "8.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** A very common comorbidity, especially in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease (I2510) and other cardiovascular risk factors.\n",
      "9.  **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications):** Diabetes is a significant risk factor for impaired wound healing, surgical complications, and infections (contributing to the \"non-healing wound\"). The presence of code Z794 (long term use of oral hypoglycemic drugs) strongly supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "10. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs):** This code directly indicates the patient is being treated for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (E119).\n",
      "11. **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** Obesity is a common comorbidity and a risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and surgical wound complications. The specific BMI code (Z6836) further details this.\n",
      "12. **Z6836 (Body mass index (BMI) 36.0-36.9, adult):** This code provides the specific BMI value, confirming the patient's obesity (E669).\n",
      "13. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Another common comorbidity, frequently associated with diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerotic heart disease.\n",
      "14. **Y834 (Other surgical operations with implant of artificial substitute or internal device as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication):** This external cause code indicates that a complication arose from a previous surgical operation involving an implant (the \"6 sternal wires\" that were removed). The non-healing wound and infection are the \"abnormal reaction or later complication.\"\n",
      "15. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** This is a general external cause code used when the specific place where the event (e.g., onset of complication, infection) occurred is not further specified in the record snippet.\n",
      "16. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** A common risk factor for cardiovascular disease (I2510, I252) and impaired wound healing, often present in the history of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n",

      "2.  **K7581 (Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)):** The underlying cause of the cirrhosis is identified as \"NASH cirrhosis.\" K75.81 specifically codes for Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\n",
      "3.  **K766 (Portal hypertension):** The record explicitly states \"cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension.\"\n",
      "4.  **R188 (Other ascites):** The record explicitly mentions \"ascites\" and \"refractory ascites.\"\n",
      "5.  **K7290 (Hepatic encephalopathy, unspecified, without coma):** The chief complaint is \"altered mental status\" and the HPI states \"hepatic encephalopathy\" and \"encephalopathy for the last day,\" with \"increased confusion.\"\n",
      "6.  **E860 (Volume depletion):** The HPI notes \"encephalopathy ... in the setting of dehydration\" and the exam found \"Dry MM.\"\n",
      "7.  **E872 (Hyperkalemia):** The record mentions \"At that point patient was having refractory ascites along with hyperkalemia.\"\n",
      "8.  **E854 (Organ-limited amyloidosis):** The HPI states \"nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis\" and a \"renal biopsy which demonstrated amyloidosis.\"\n",
      "9.  **N08 (Glomerular disorders in diseases classified elsewhere):** The HPI describes \"nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis\" and \"significant proteinuria during this admission, which is concerning for nephrotic syndrome. Urine collection demonstrated greater than 10g of protein per day.\" N08 is used for glomerular disorders in systemic diseases like amyloidosis.\n",
      "10. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Given the patient's severe liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, dehydration, and increased diuretic dosing leading to hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury/failure is a highly anticipated and common complication, even if not explicitly termed \"acute kidney failure\" in the chief complaint.\n",
      "11. **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** The presence of \"nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis\" indicates a chronic, progressive kidney condition, which would inevitably lead to or constitute chronic kidney disease.\n",
      "12. **K639 (Disease of intestine, unspecified):** The PET scan \"demonstrated ... a 1.8 cm nodule in the sigmoid colon concerning for malignancy.\" This is an unspecified disease of the intestine undergoing workup.\n",
      "13. **K77 (Liver disorders in diseases classified elsewhere):** The patient has \"liver adenocarcinoma.\" K77.1 specifically codes for \"Liver disorders in neoplastic disease,\" which covers the presence of the liver cancer.\n",
      "14. **D684 (Acquired coagulation factor deficiency):** With MELD Na 15/Child's class B/C NASH cirrhosis, the liver's synthetic function is significantly impaired, often leading to acquired deficiencies in coagulation factors. This is a common comorbidity in severe liver disease.\n",
      "15. **E46 (Undernutrition, unspecified):** A patient with end-stage cirrhosis, ascites, and malignancy is highly susceptible to malnutrition and weight loss (cachexia), even if not explicitly stated as \"undernutrition.\" This is a reasonable clinical inference for such a complex patient.\n",
      "16. **Z8711 (Personal history of diseases of the digestive system):** The patient has a history of \"NASH cirrhosis,\" \"portal hypertension,\" \"liver adenocarcinoma,\" and a \"sigmoid colon nodule,\" all of which are diseases of the digestive system.\n",
      "17. **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions):** This broad code accounts for a personal history of other significant chronic conditions not covered by more specific Z-codes, such as amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome, which are chronic and systemic in nature.\n",

      "1.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)**: While not explicitly stated, depression is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic pain (fibromyalgia) and acute, life-threatening conditions like cardiac tamponade requiring hospitalization and sedation. This code likely reflects a historical diagnosis or a new diagnosis identified during a more comprehensive psychiatric assessment (not detailed in HPI).\n",
      "2.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified)**: Similar to F329, anxiety is a frequent comorbidity with chronic illness, acute medical crises (dyspnea, cardiac tamponade), and the general stress of hospitalization. This code likely reflects a historical diagnosis or a new diagnosis identified during a more comprehensive psychiatric assessment.\n",
      "3.  **I071 (Tricuspid insufficiency (nonrheumatic))**: The HPI does not explicitly mention tricuspid insufficiency. However, severe pericardial effusion and tamponade (I314) can affect right heart pressures and function. An echocardiogram performed to diagnose the effusion would also assess valvular function, and this code likely represents a finding from that imaging or a pre-existing condition not detailed in the HPI summary.\n",
      "4.  **I309 (Acute pericarditis, unspecified)**: The patient presented with \"three weeks of fevers, chills\" and \"pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.\" Acute pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardium that often leads to effusion and can progress to tamponade, making this a highly likely underlying diagnosis for the effusion.\n",
      "5.  **I314 (Cardiac tamponade)**: Directly stated in the History of Present Illness: \"now found to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.\"\n",
      "6.  **I97710 (Postprocedural cardiac arrest following cardiac catheterization)**: The patient underwent \"Pericardial Drain Placement\". While the HPI does not explicitly detail a \"cardiac arrest\" or \"cardiac catheterization,\" this code broadly signifies a severe post-procedural cardiac complication. It implies a significant cardiac event (e.g., severe arrhythmia, profound hypotension, or actual arrest) occurred during or immediately after this invasive cardiac procedure, even if not explicitly described as \"cardiac arrest\" in the HPI excerpt.\n",
      "7.  **J9601 (Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia)**: The chief complaint is \"dyspnea,\" and the HPI describes \"dyspnea on exertion\" and becoming \"dyspneic with minimal movement,\" in the context of cardiac tamponade. This indicates severe respiratory compromise likely leading to acute respiratory failure with hypoxia.\n",
      "8.  **L282 (Dermatitis artefacta)**: The provided medical record (chief complaint, history of present illness, allergies, procedures) does not contain information directly related to dermatitis artefacta or any skin condition that would lead to this diagnosis. This code was likely assigned based on information from other parts of the patient's comprehensive medical record not included in this excerpt.\n",
      "9.  **L958 (Other conditions of skin and subcutaneous tissue in diseases classified elsewhere)**: Similar to L282, the provided medical record does not contain information directly related to skin or subcutaneous tissue conditions. This code was likely assigned based on information from other parts of the patient's comprehensive medical record not included in this excerpt.\n",
      "10. **M797 (Fibromyalgia)**: Directly stated in the History of Present Illness as a \"PMHx of fibromyalgia\" and reinforced by \"shoulder pain worse than her fibromyalgia pain.\"\n",
      "11. **R4182 (Other syndromes of altered mental status)**: The HPI notes the patient \"is sleepy from sedation\" and experienced \"dizziness,\" both of which contribute to altered mental status.\n",
      "12. **T424X5A (Adverse effect of benzodiazepines, initial encounter)**: The HPI notes the patient \"is sleepy from sedation.\" Benzodiazepines are commonly used for sedation. This code indicates an adverse effect (like drowsiness) from such medication, with 'A' signifying the initial encounter for this condition.\n",

      "1.  **E1069 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with other specified complication)**: The medical record explicitly states \"type 1 diabetic male.\" The \"other specified complication\" component refers to the severe complications of diabetes, specifically the osteomyelitis of the toe and the subsequent amputations, which are common manifestations of diabetic foot disease.\n",
      "2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified)**: While not explicitly stated in this snippet of the medical record, hyperlipidemia is a very common comorbidity associated with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, especially in patients who develop vascular complications leading to conditions like osteomyelitis and amputations. It is highly probable that this diagnosis is present in the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "3.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)**: Similar to hyperlipidemia, essential hypertension is a frequent comorbidity found in patients with Type 1 Diabetes, often contributing to vascular issues and general health complications. It is a highly probable diagnosis from the patient's full medical history.\n",
      "4.  **M868X7 (Other osteomyelitis, left ankle and foot)**: The chief complaint clearly states \"L ___ toe osteomyelitis.\" The code M86.8X7 specifically identifies osteomyelitis in the ankle and foot region, which includes the toes, and on the left side.\n",
      "5.  **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin)**: As a patient with Type 1 Diabetes, it is a medical certainty that he requires and is on long-term insulin therapy for management.\n",
      "6.  **Z89421 (Acquired absence of right lesser toe(s))**: The history of present illness mentions \"The patient had undergone a prior fifth toe amputation.\" A fifth toe is considered a lesser toe. Since the current amputation is on the left foot and both Z89421 and Z89422 are listed, it implies the prior amputation was on the right lesser toe to account for Z89421.\n",
      "7.  **Z89422 (Acquired absence of left lesser toe(s))**: This code would account for the \"L ___ toe amputation\" mentioned as the major surgical procedure, indicating the acquired absence of a lesser toe on the left foot after the surgery. It also covers if the \"prior fifth toe amputation\" was on the left, or if another left lesser toe was previously amputated. Given both right and left lesser toe amputation codes are assigned, the patient has had at least one lesser toe amputated from each foot or has one planned (the current left toe amputation).\n",

      "17. **M170 (Bilateral primary osteoarthrosis of knee):** Osteoarthritis is a common chronic condition, particularly in older individuals, and may be part of the patient's established medical history, even if not directly related to the chief complaint.\n",
      "18. **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** The significantly elevated BUN/Cr (60/2.8) and reduced fluid intake (\"drinking a lot less than usual\") indicate an acute kidney injury.\n",
      "19. **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3):** The patient's history of type II diabetes and hypertension are common causes of chronic kidney disease. This code reflects a pre-existing chronic renal impairment.\n",
      "20. **R180 (Malignant ascites):** Given the patient's \"stage IVB serous endometrial carcinoma\" with likely peritoneal involvement (as per C786), malignant ascites is a common complication. \"Occasional abdominal pain\" could also be a symptom.\n",
      "21. **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids and synthetic analogues, initial encounter):** Glucocorticoids are often used in cancer management (e.g., to manage side effects, inflammation) or for severe respiratory conditions like asthma. This code indicates a documented adverse effect from such medication.\n",
      "22. **T424X5A (Adverse effect of benzodiazepines, initial encounter):** Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, or as muscle relaxants. This code indicates a documented adverse effect from such medication.\n",

While \"neurogenic claudication\" is nerve-related, patients with lumbar stenosis can sometimes have concomitant vascular issues that might be documented in their broader medical history.\n",
      "7.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma):** This code indicates a diagnosis of asthma. However, there is no information provided in the given medical record snippet (chief complaint, history of present illness, allergies, or major procedures) that supports a diagnosis of asthma.

The \"unspecified, not intractable\" components are used when further details about the specific type or intractability of epilepsy are not provided in the limited history.\n",
      "2.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** The patient's allergy list includes \"Celexa\" (citalopram), which is a common antidepressant. This strongly suggests a history of \"Major depressive disorder.\" \"Unspecified\" is used as no specific details about the episode (e.g., severity, recurrent) are given.\n",
      "3.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** The patient's allergy list includes \"buspirone,\" which is an anxiolytic medication. This indicates a history of an \"Anxiety disorder.\" \"Unspecified\" is used due to the lack of specific details about the type of anxiety.\n",
      "4.  **R42 (Dizziness and giddiness):** While not explicitly stated in the chief complaint or HPI, \"Dizziness and giddiness\" can be a common symptom associated with a seizure (e.g., post-ictal phase) or other neurological conditions, making it a plausible accompanying symptom for a patient presenting with seizures to Neurology.\n",
      "5.  **E039 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified):** \"Hypothyroidism\" is a common endocrine disorder, particularly in females, and can have systemic effects that may influence neurological function or general well-being. It is a frequent comorbidity, even if not directly causing the chief complaint. \"Unspecified\" indicates the lack of detailed diagnostic information in this brief record.\n",
      "6.  **E559 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified):** \"Vitamin D deficiency\" is highly prevalent and often co-occurs with other chronic health issues, potentially impacting bone health and general metabolic function. \"Unspecified\" is used when no specific lab values are provided.\n",
      "7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** \"Hyperlipidemia\" is a very common chronic metabolic condition. It is frequently present as a comorbidity in adult patients, even if not directly related to the acute presentation.\n",
      "8.  **M8580 (Other specified disorders of bone density and structure, unspecified site):** This code points to an issue with bone health. It could be related to the Vitamin D deficiency (E559) or another underlying condition affecting bones. \"Unspecified site\" is used due to lack of specific location details.\n",
      "9.  **N390 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified):** \"Urinary tract infections\" are common, especially in females, and can sometimes precipitate or complicate neurological events like seizures or altered mental status, making it a relevant comorbidity to consider.\n",
      "10. **T426X5A (Adverse effect of other antiepileptic and sedative-hypnotic drugs, initial encounter):** Given the \"Chief Complaint: Seizure,\" this code suggests that the patient's seizure event might be an \"Adverse effect\" of their antiepileptic medication (e.g., toxicity, paradoxical reaction, or even withdrawal from a missed dose). It could also refer to an adverse effect from a sedative-hypnotic. \"Initial encounter\" specifies that this is the first encounter for this specific adverse effect.\n",
      "11. **Y92238 (Place of occurrence: Public building, other specified):** This is an external cause code indicating the \"Place of occurrence\" where the seizure or associated event took place. Without specific HPI, this suggests the event happened in a public building setting before the patient presented for care.\n",

Given the patient's reluctance to see doctors (\"does not like seeing doctors and ___ not seen one in some time\"), an underlying anxiety component is plausible, especially considering the high caffeine intake which can exacerbate anxiety. This code is general enough to cover such associated mental health symptoms.\n",

      "1.  **J80 (Acute respiratory distress syndrome):** Directly stated as \"ARDS\" and \"severe ARDS\" in the history of present illness. The chief complaint of \"Hypoxemic respiratory failure\" is the clinical manifestation of ARDS.\n",
      "2.  **J189 (Pneumonia, unspecified organism):** The patient's initial symptoms (\"cough, fevers, chills, myalgias\"), a \"positive flu swab\" (indicating viral pneumonia/influenza), and the subsequent development of ARDS, which is often a complication of severe pneumonia, support this code. The broad-spectrum antibiotics also suggest treatment for presumed infection.\n",
      "3.  **J9383 (Other pneumothorax):** The medical record explicitly states the patient was \"found to have small to moderate bilateral PTX, likely secondary to barotrauma\" and underwent \"b/l chest tubes placed.\"\n",
      "4.  **J982 (Interstitial emphysema):** The patient developed \"swollen neck and crepitus\" which are clinical signs of subcutaneous emphysema, often a consequence or associated with interstitial emphysema due to barotrauma, as mentioned alongside the pneumothorax.\n",
      "5.  **N179 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified):** Severe critical illness like ARDS and sepsis often leads to acute kidney injury. The patient was \"intermittently diuresed with IV Lasix,\" which can be for fluid management in ARDS but also for managing kidney dysfunction.\n",
      "6.  **E1165 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia):** The patient has a \"PMH of DM.\" In critically ill patients, especially under stress and receiving corticosteroids (\"IV solumedrol,\" \"oral prednisone\"), hyperglycemia is a common complication.\n",
      "7.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient has a \"PMH of HLD,\" directly supporting this code.\n",
      "8.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** While not explicitly stated in the PMH, hypertension is a very common comorbidity, especially in patients with DM and HLD, and is often coded as a background chronic condition.\n",
      "9.  **F05 (Delirium, not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances):** The patient's initial presentation of \"not feeling like herself,\" combined with severe critical illness, intubation, and sedation in an ICU setting, makes delirium a highly probable and common complication.\n",
      "10. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** Constipation is a very common issue in critically ill, sedated, and immobile patients in the ICU.\n",
      "11. **D72829 (Other compensated leukocytosis):** Severe infection (pneumonia) and systemic inflammation (ARDS) typically cause an elevation in white blood cell count (leukocytosis).\n",
      "12. **E870 (Hyperosmolality and hyponatremia):** Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia, are common in severe critical illness, especially with fluid shifts and diuretic use (Lasix).\n",
      "13. **E873 (Alkalosis):** Both respiratory alkalosis (due to ventilation management) and metabolic alkalosis (due to diuretic use like Lasix) can occur in critically ill patients.\n",
      "14. **T380X5A (Adverse effect of glucocorticoids, initial encounter):** The patient received \"3d course of IV solumedrol\" and \"oral prednisone\" for severe ARDS. Glucocorticoids have numerous potential adverse effects that could have been identified.\n",
      "15. **Y92239 (Unspecified place in hospital):** The patient's entire course of illness occurred within a hospital setting, including transfer from OSH and admission to the MICU.\n",
      "16. **I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Although the \"Cardiac work-up, including TTE and BNP (per report) were unremarkable/negative\" in terms of *causing* respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that can occur as a complication of severe critical illness, hypoxemia, or sepsis.\n",
      "17. **R571 (Cardiogenic shock):** While the cardiac workup was \"unremarkable/negative\" for the *etiology* of respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock may have been considered in the differential diagnosis given the critical state, or a transient episode of cardiac compromise with features of shock might have occurred, even if it was not the primary cause of ARDS or was ultimately resolved/ruled out as the ongoing primary issue.\n",
      "18. **Z515 (Encounter for palliative care):** Given the patient's severe, persistent respiratory failure of unclear etiology and critical status, a palliative care consultation to discuss goals of care is a common and appropriate step in the ICU.\n",
      "19. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** If a palliative care consultation (Z515) was undertaken, discussions about code status, including a DNR order, are a frequent outcome for critically ill patients with severe prognosis, even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI summary.\n",

      "13. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** This is a common comorbidity for patients with CAD, PVD, and Diabetes, and is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis. It's part of the patient's past medical history.\n",
      "14. **I132 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 5 chronic kidney disease, or end stage renal disease):** The combination of \"HFpEF\" and \"ESRD on HD\" directly supports this code, which also implicitly indicates hypertension.\n",

      "16. **Z794 (Long-term (current) use of oral anticoagulants/antiplatelets):** \"She reports that she has been taking her... Plavix faithfully daily.\" Plavix (clopidogrel) is an antiplatelet.\n",
      "17. **Z982 (Encounter for aftercare following vascular surgery):** The patient has a history of multiple \"s/p\" (status post) vascular procedures including \"R CFA/SFA patch repair,\" \"R SFA PTA and L SFA stent,\" and is undergoing more extensive procedures. This code indicates the ongoing management related to these past vascular surgeries.\n",
      "18. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** This is a common comorbidity in patients with extensive vascular disease and a history of smoking (often implied with Z87891). It's a plausible PMHx.\n",
      "19. **I2720 (Pulmonary hypertension, unspecified):** Pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of HFpEF, making it a plausible PMHx item.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **Chief Complaint & Acute Infection:** The chief complaint \"Left Foot Infection\" directly leads to several codes. The HPI further describes an \"abscess to the Left Foot\" and \"fevers as well as increased pain and swelling to the L foot,\" confirming an acute infection.\n",
      "    *   **L02612 (Cutaneous abscess of left heel):** Directly corresponds to \"abscess to the Left Foot.\"\n",
      "    *   **B9561 (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere):** While the specific pathogen isn't mentioned, Staphylococcus aureus is a very common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, especially abscesses, and is often assumed in the absence of other specific lab results in such clinical contexts, particularly in diabetic patients. This code identifies the bacterial agent for the abscess/infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (PMH & Complications):** The PMH states \"DMII.\" The HPI mentions \"plantar heel ulceration\" and a \"prior L heel ulceration.\" Diabetes is a major contributing factor to foot ulcers and infections.\n",
      "    *   **E11621 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with foot ulcer):** Directly corresponds to \"DMII\" and \"plantar heel ulceration.\"\n",
      "    *   **E11628 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other skin complications):** The \"abscess to the Left Foot\" is an \"other skin complication\" of diabetes.\n",
      "    *   **E1140 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified):** Diabetic neuropathy is a very common and often underlying factor in the development of diabetic foot ulcers, even if not explicitly stated in this HPI snippet, it's a frequent comorbidity for such a patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Chronic Foot Ulceration:** The HPI states \"plantar heel ulceration\" and \"wound to the L heel for several weeks now.\"\n",
      "    *   **L97421 (Non-pressure chronic ulcer of left heel with necrosis, not elsewhere classified):** This code accurately describes a \"plantar heel ulceration\" that is \"chronic\" (\"for several weeks now\"). The term \"necrosis\" is often associated with such non-healing, chronic diabetic ulcers, and its inclusion in the assigned code implies it was present or suspected.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **History of Prior Surgery and Complications:** The HPI mentions \"prior L heel ulceration which was treated with a free flap with the plastics team.\" A free flap is a type of tissue transplant. The current infection could be a complication related to this previous surgery.\n",
      "    *   **T86822 (Post-transplant infection of skin, not elsewhere classified):** The \"free flap\" is a form of transplant. The current \"left foot infection\" could be considered an infection at or related to the site of this prior transplant.\n",
      "    *   **Y832 (Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** The recurrence of ulceration and infection at the site of a previous surgical flap procedure can be coded as a \"later complication\" of that surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Other Past Medical History:** The PMH states \"HTN, HLD.\"\n",
      "    *   **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Corresponds to \"HTN.\"\n",
      "    *   **E7800 (Pure hypercholesterolemia, unspecified):** Corresponds to \"HLD\" (Hyperlipidemia), as hypercholesterolemia is a common form of hyperlipidemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Surgical Procedures Performed:** The \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section lists \"Left foot incision and drainage\" and \"Left foot debridement with primary closure,\" which confirm intervention for the infection and ulcer.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Codes from Broader Past Medical History (Not detailed in HPI snippet):** Several codes are not explicitly mentioned or clearly inferable from the provided HPI but are part of the patient's comprehensive ICD-10 code list, suggesting they are existing diagnoses from the patient's full medical record (PMH).\n",
      "    *   **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** A psychiatric diagnosis, likely from PMH.\n",
      "    *   **F410 (Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety]):** A psychiatric diagnosis, likely from PMH.\n",
      "    *   **F429 (Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified):** A psychiatric diagnosis, likely from PMH.\n",
      "    *   **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** A respiratory diagnosis, likely from PMH.\n",
      "    *   **J4520 (Mild persistent asthma, uncomplicated):** A respiratory diagnosis, likely from PMH.\n",
      "    *   **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** A gastrointestinal diagnosis, likely from PMH.\n",
      "    *   **Z23 (Encounter for immunization):** A preventative health code, indicating an immunization was given or discussed, likely from a broader patient encounter record.\n",
      "    *   **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** A history code for a past addiction, likely from PMH.\n",
      "    *   **Z89411 (Acquired absence of right great toe), Z89412 (Acquired absence of left great toe), Z89421 (Acquired absence of right lesser toe(s)), Z89422 (Acquired absence of left lesser toe(s)):** Given the patient's severe, chronic, and recurrent diabetic foot complications, it is highly plausible that they have undergone previous toe amputations, which would be documented in their PMH.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Place of Occurrence:**\n",
      "    *   **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** This code is used when the specific place where an external cause of injury or condition (e.g., the original event leading to the ulcer, or the acquisition of the infection) occurred is unknown or not specified in the current record.\n",

      "2.  **E10.51 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy with gangrene):** The patient is a \"type I diabetic.\" His chief complaint and detailed history involve \"bilateral leg and calf pain,\" specifically pain \"when climbing stairs or going uphill the back of his calves particularly hurt and with increased activity this can increase to include the lower part of his upper legs.\" This description is classic for claudication, a symptom of peripheral angiopathy, which is a common complication of diabetes. Although the record denies \"ulcerations of his feet or wounds that are not healing,\" thereby negating overt gangrene, the presence of significant claudication strongly suggests diabetic peripheral angiopathy, and this code might have been assigned for the vascular complication component.\n",
      "3.  **K86.1 (Acute pancreatitis):** The medical record explicitly states \"findings of a pancreatic duct stone with obstruction,\" \"abnormal LFTs,\" and \"CT abdomen showed calculi in the pancreatic duct mid body and tail with associated distal pancreatic duct dilatation.\" These findings, along with elevated AST/ALT (transaminitis), are highly indicative of acute pancreatitis caused by biliary obstruction.\n",
      "4.  **K86.89 (Other specified diseases of pancreas):** This code likely refers to the underlying condition of \"pancreatic duct stone with obstruction\" and \"calculi in the pancreatic duct,\" which are specific diseases of the pancreas not fully captured by just acute pancreatitis. It could also imply chronic changes or the presence of the obstruction itself.\n",
      "5.  **M79.661 (Pain in right lower leg) & M79.662 (Pain in left lower leg):** The chief complaint is \"Leg pain.\" The History of Present Illness details \"bilateral leg and calf pain\" and further describes its nature, directly supporting the coding for pain in both lower legs.\n",
      "6.  **Z79.4 (Long-term (current) use of insulin):** The patient is diagnosed with \"type I diabetic,\" which mandates long-term insulin therapy. The mention of previously not affording insulin further confirms insulin as a necessary and usually current treatment.\n",
      "7.  **D64.9 (Anemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly detailed in the provided excerpt (e.g., specific hemoglobin levels are not given), anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic illnesses like uncontrolled diabetes and chronic pancreatic issues. If this code was assigned, it implies that laboratory findings, not included in this summary, indicated anemia.\n",
      "8.  **D69.6 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified):** Similar to anemia, this condition is not explicitly supported by lab values in the provided record. However, thrombocytopenia can be associated with various systemic conditions, including chronic inflammation or liver involvement, which might be present in a complex patient with pancreatic issues and uncontrolled diabetes. If this code was assigned, it suggests underlying lab findings.\n",

      "1.  **Chief Complaint: leg swelling:** This primary symptom of fluid retention points directly to conditions affecting the heart or kidneys.\n",
      "2.  **I5033 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure, unspecified):** This diagnosis directly explains the \"leg swelling\" as a manifestation of fluid overload due to the heart's inability to relax and fill properly.\n",
      "3.  **I425 (Other restrictive cardiomyopathy) & I43 (Cardiomyopathy in diseases classified elsewhere):** Restrictive cardiomyopathy (I425) is a specific type of heart muscle disease where the ventricles are stiff, directly leading to diastolic heart failure (I5033). I43 indicates that this cardiomyopathy is secondary to another underlying systemic disease.\n",
      "4.  **E854 (Familial amyloid polyneuropathy):** Amyloidosis, particularly familial forms, is a well-known cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy (I425, I43) and can therefore be the underlying systemic disease leading to heart failure (I5033) and subsequent leg swelling. It often affects multiple organs, including the heart and kidneys.\n",
      "5.  **D472 (Monoclonal gammopathy, unspecified):** Monoclonal gammopathy is frequently associated with certain types of amyloidosis (e.g., AL amyloidosis), strengthening the likelihood of E854 being the cause of the cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "6.  **N189 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified):** Chronic kidney disease is a common comorbidity with heart failure (cardio-renal syndrome) and systemic diseases like amyloidosis. It can also independently contribute to leg swelling due to fluid retention.\n",
      "7.  **D649 (Anemia, unspecified):** Anemia is common in patients with chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease (N189), heart failure (I5033), and systemic illnesses like amyloidosis (E854).\n",
      "8.  **I129 (Hypertensive heart disease without heart failure):** This indicates a history or current presence of hypertension impacting the heart. While I5033 indicates heart failure *is* present, I129 may reflect the underlying hypertensive etiology that contributed to the cardiac dysfunction or a long-standing diagnosis.\n",
      "9.  **I340 (Nonrheumatic mitral (valve) insufficiency):** This represents a common valvular heart condition that can coexist with other cardiac pathologies like cardiomyopathy and heart failure.\n",
      "10. **I482 (Permanent atrial fibrillation):** Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia, frequently observed in patients with structural heart disease, heart failure, and older age.\n",
      "11. **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** High cholesterol is a very common metabolic comorbidity, often present in patients with cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "12. **E0590 (Thyrotoxicosis, unspecified):** Hyperthyroidism is a condition that can affect the cardiovascular system and, if present, can exacerbate or contribute to heart failure.\n",
      "13. **F0150 (Vascular dementia without behavioral disturbance):** Vascular dementia is often seen in older patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors and disease, aligning with the complex cardiac picture.\n",
      "14. **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** COPD is a common chronic respiratory condition, especially in older individuals, and frequently coexists with cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "15. **N39490 (Other specified disorders of urinary system, unspecified):** This code indicates another specific urinary system issue beyond chronic kidney disease, which would be documented elsewhere in the full medical record.\n",
      "16. **S80921A (Unspecified superficial injury of left lower leg, initial encounter):** This code indicates a recent, minor superficial injury to the left lower leg. While \"leg swelling\" points to edema, a superficial injury might also have been noted upon examination. The \"A\" signifies an initial encounter.\n",
      "17. **X58XXXA (Exposure to other specified factors, initial encounter):** This is the external cause code for the injury S80921A, indicating an exposure to an unspecified factor that caused the injury.\n",
      "18. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** This code indicates that the specific location where the injury (S80921A) occurred was not documented.\n",
      "19. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate status):** This is an administrative code reflecting the patient's advance directive regarding resuscitation, indicating end-of-life care planning.\n",
      "20. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants):** This code indicates ongoing anticoagulant medication use, commonly prescribed for conditions like atrial fibrillation (I482), or history of thromboembolic events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient presents with leg swelling, which is attributed to chronic diastolic heart failure caused by restrictive cardiomyopathy, likely secondary to familial amyloid polyneuropathy and possibly monoclonal gammopathy. This complex cardiac picture includes hypertension, mitral insufficiency, and permanent atrial fibrillation. Other significant comorbidities include chronic kidney disease, anemia, hyperlipidemia, thyrotoxicosis, vascular dementia, and COPD.

However, the provided history of present illness does not contain any information or clinical findings to directly support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. It would be a pre-existing or co-existing medical condition not elaborated upon in this specific HPI.\n",
      "2.  **F1190 (Opioid use disorder, unspecified, in remission)**: The patient describes severe chronic pain that \"pain medications do not touch it,\" which can sometimes be associated with a history of opioid use or tolerance. While not explicitly stated as 'opioid use disorder' in the HPI, this code may reflect a history of such a condition, or a documented concern regarding medication management in the context of chronic pain.\n",
      "3.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated)**: This is an assigned code for the patient. The provided history of present illness does not include any information about the patient's smoking status or nicotine dependence. It is likely a pre-existing or co-existing condition documented elsewhere in the patient's full medical record.\n",
      "4.  **G90521 (Complex regional pain syndrome I of right upper limb)**: This is an assigned code for the patient. However, the patient's chief complaint and detailed history of present illness describe radicular pain in the *right lower limb* (L5 distribution, thigh, calf, ankle), not the upper limb. Therefore, this specific code for CRPS of the right *upper limb* is not directly supported by the information provided in this HPI. It could represent a separate, pre-existing condition or an inconsistency in the provided data.\n",
      "5.  **M48061 (Spinal stenosis, lumbar region, with radiculopathy)**: The patient has a \"h/o back problems\" and presents with \"very severe right-sided radicular pain roughly L5 distribution, down the back of the thigh down through the back of the calf and into the ankle.\" He is also \"booked for elective L4-L5 laminectomy,\" which is a common surgical procedure for spinal stenosis with radiculopathy in the lumbar region. This code perfectly matches these clinical findings.\n",
      "6.  **M5116 (Thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy, Lumbar region)**: The patient presents with \"very severe right-sided radicular pain roughly L5 distribution,\" \"down the back of the thigh down through the back of the calf and into the ankle.\" The planned \"L4-L5 laminectomy\" also points to a disc disorder at the lumbar level causing radiculopathy. This code directly aligns with the patient's symptoms and planned surgery for a lumbar disc issue.\n",
      "7.  **Z23 (Encounter for immunization)**: This is an assigned code for the patient. The provided history of present illness does not contain any information about an encounter for immunization. This code is typically used for administrative purposes when a patient receives a vaccination and would be documented in a separate part of the medical record.\n",
      "8.  **Z9689 (Presence of other specified functional implants)**: The patient has a clear history of \"a spinal cord stimulator,\" which is a functional implant. This code directly documents the presence of this device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient presents with severe, uncontrolled lumbar radicular pain attributed to spinal stenosis and disc disorder with radiculopathy, having a history of a spinal cord stimulator. The HPI also notes an elevated WBC and concern for SCS infection, though specific codes for infection are not in the provided list. Some of the assigned codes (D869, F17210, G90521, Z23, F1190) are not directly or fully supported by the provided HPI but are listed as patient's ICD-10 codes, suggesting they are part of their broader medical history.\n",

      "1.  **I214 (Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction):** The patient \"presents with chest pain,\" specifically \"acute onset of left side chest pressure without radiation,\" associated with \"nausea and dyspnea.\" The pain \"slowly dissipated after ~1hr\" and was \"somewhat different in quality compared to his prior cardiac events,\" fitting the presentation of a new NSTEMI.\n",
      "2.  **I252 (Old myocardial infarction):** Directly stated in the history as \"s/p old MI.\"\n",
      "3.  **I25810 (Atherosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft(s) without angina pectoris):** The patient has a \"history of CAD s/p CABG.\" This code indicates ongoing atherosclerotic disease within the bypass grafts, which is a common finding and potential cause for new cardiac symptoms. The \"without angina pectoris\" might refer to his baseline state or the condition of the graft itself rather than the acute presenting symptom.\n",
      "4.  **I2582 (Chronic total occlusion of coronary artery):** Implied by the patient's extensive history of \"CAD s/p CABG\" and \"s/p old MI,\" which suggests significant, advanced coronary artery disease. The patient also notes \"slowing down over the last few years,\" which could be related to chronic ischemic burden.\n",
      "5.  **I482 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** Directly stated in the history as \"paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\"\n",
      "6.  **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure, severe):** The patient has \"chronic ___ edema which has been stable\" and has \"noted himself slowing down over the last few years,\" which are symptoms consistent with chronic heart failure, particularly diastolic heart failure in a patient with extensive cardiac history.\n",
      "7.  **I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension):** Directly stated in the history as \"HTN.\"\n",
      "8.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Directly stated in the history as \"hyperlipidemia.\"\n",
      "9.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** Directly stated in the history as \"obesity.\"\n",
      "10. **Z6838 (Body mass index (BMI) 38.0-38.9, adult):** This provides a specific measurement for the \"obesity\" diagnosis.\n",
      "11. **G4733 (Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)):** Directly stated in the history as \"OSA on CPAP.\"\n",
      "12. **Z951 (Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft):** Directly stated in the history as \"s/p CABG.\"\n",
      "13. **Z7901 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants):** Directly stated that the patient is \"on coumadin\" for atrial fibrillation.\n",
      "14. **Z9861 (Postprocedural status, angioplasty of coronary artery):** While CABG is mentioned, angioplasty is a common intervention for CAD. It is plausible that the patient has a history of prior angioplasty as part of their extensive cardiac history, even if not explicitly detailed in the provided snippet.\n",
      "15. **Z7982 (Long-term (current) use of aspirin):** For a patient with a history of CAD, MI, and CABG, long-term aspirin use for secondary prevention is standard of care, making this a highly probable code.\n",
      "16. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** Nicotine dependence is a significant risk factor for CAD, MI, and peripheral vascular disease. It's a very common personal history in patients with this cardiac profile, even if not explicitly stated in the limited HPI.\n",
      "17. **E861 (Volume depletion/Dehydration):** The acute cardiac event was associated with \"nausea and dyspnea,\" which can lead to reduced oral intake or increased fluid loss, potentially resulting in volume depletion.\n",
      "18. **I959 (Hypotension, unspecified):** Hypotension can occur transiently during an acute cardiac event or be related to cardiac medications.\n",
      "19. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Given the chief complaint of \"Chest pain\" and associated \"nausea,\" GERD is a common differential diagnosis or comorbidity, often requiring evaluation.\n",
      "20. **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, without status asthmaticus):** Asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition that can be a comorbidity, especially when dyspnea is a symptom.\n",
      "21. **H9190 (Unspecified hearing loss, unspecified ear):** This is a common age-related condition in older individuals, likely part of the patient's general medical history not elaborated in the HPI focused on the acute cardiac event.\n",
      "22. **M25562 (Pain in left knee):** Musculoskeletal pain, especially in the knee, is a very common chronic complaint in older and obese individuals, likely part of the patient's general health record.\n",
      "23. **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** BPH is a very common age-related condition in older males, often present as a silent comorbidity.\n",

      "2.  **I25110 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris):** Several elements in the \"History of Present Illness\" support this:\n",
      "    *   \"known 40% mid-LAD occlusion\" indicates established atherosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).\n",
      "    *   \"new exertional component to his pain with central chest tightness diffuse across the chest,\" \"aggravated by physical exertion,\" \"experienced wakening from sleep due to discomfort,\" \"Discomfort radiates to his back with some radiation down his left arm\" are classic symptoms of angina.\n",

      "    *   \"given 0.4 SL NTG with chest pain improvement\" further supports an anginal origin for the pain.\n",
      "3.  **Z952 (Presence of prosthetic heart valve):** The patient's history includes \"now 6 months s/p AVR with bioprosthetic valve,\" which directly indicates the presence of a prosthetic heart valve.\n",
      "4.  **I129 (Hypertensive heart disease without heart failure, unspecified):** The \"hx of hypertension\" in a patient with significant cardiovascular history (aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, prosthetic valve) strongly suggests that the hypertension has impacted the heart, leading to hypertensive heart disease. There is no mention of symptoms or signs of heart failure in this record snippet, thus \"without heart failure\" is appropriate.\n",
      "5.  **Z87891 (Personal history of other specified conditions and diseases of the circulatory system):** This code is used to indicate a history of significant cardiovascular conditions.\n",

      "    *   The \"post-op pericarditis\" (even if persistent, it's referred to as \"post-op\") also falls under a personal history of a circulatory system condition.\n",
      "6.  **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Although not explicitly detailed with symptoms in the provided HPI, chest pain is a common symptom of GERD. In patients presenting with complex chest pain, GERD is a very common comorbidity and is often included in the differential diagnosis and subsequent coding, especially when cardiac causes are being thoroughly investigated. Given the absence of specific endoscopic findings or severe symptoms mentioned, \"without esophagitis\" is appropriate.\n",
      "7.  **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (moderate)):** This condition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided medical record snippet. However, chronic kidney disease is a highly prevalent comorbidity in patients with long-standing hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

      "1.  **B20 (Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease resulting in infectious and parasitic diseases):** The medical record explicitly states the patient has a \"PMHx of HIV\" and further notes she \"has not been taking her ART or antibiotic ppx.\" This indicates active, symptomatic HIV disease, not merely HIV status (Z21).\n",
      "2.  **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, the patient has chronic HIV, significant weight loss (6 lbs in a few months), and reports intermittent fever and weakness. Iron deficiency anemia is a very common comorbidity in patients with chronic diseases like HIV, especially those with poor adherence to treatment and associated malnutrition/weight loss. This code is a plausible finding given the overall clinical picture.\n",
      "3.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified):** Not explicitly stated, but chronic illness (HIV), persistent pain (headaches), and the stress of non-adherence to treatment often lead to mental health issues such as depression. This is a common comorbidity for patients with chronic and serious medical conditions.\n",
      "4.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** Similar to depression, chronic illness (HIV), unexplained symptoms (headaches, weakness), and the challenges of managing a complex health condition can frequently be accompanied by anxiety.\n",
      "5.  **G44209 (Tension-type headache, unspecified, not intractable):** The patient's chief complaint includes \"Headache.\" The HPI describes \"intermittent headaches for the past 4 months... typically occipital/frontal and described as \"dull\", \"throbbing\" and \"pressure\" like... associated with a stiff neck... prevents her from sleeping at times... endorses eye pain with movement.\" These symptoms are consistent with a tension-type headache.\n",
      "6.  **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, without status asthmaticus):** The patient's Past Medical History (PMHx) explicitly lists \"Asthma.\"\n",
      "7.  **R531 (Weakness, generalized):** The chief complaint includes \"LLE weakness\" (Left Lower Extremity weakness), and the HPI further details \"new onset LLE weakness... persisted but not clearly worsened; it is most notable when trying to climb stairs. She has been using her L hand to help lift her leg.\" While localized, this can be categorized under generalized weakness if a specific neurological diagnosis isn't yet established or if it reflects overall debility.\n",
      "8.  **R634 (Abnormal weight loss):** The \"general review of systems\" states, \"the pt endorses recent... weight loss (~6 lbs over the past few months).\"\n",
      "9.  **T3696XA (Underdosing of unspecified systemic antibiotic, initial encounter):** The HPI states, \"patient has a diagnosis of HIV and states she has not been taking her... antibiotic ppx since ___.\" This explicitly indicates underdosing of an antibiotic. The 'A' signifies an initial encounter.\n",
      "10. **T50996A (Underdosing of other and unspecified drugs, medicaments and biological substances, initial encounter):** The HPI states, \"patient has a diagnosis of HIV and states she has not been taking her ART... since ___.\" Antiretroviral therapy (ART) falls under \"other and unspecified drugs.\" The 'A' signifies an initial encounter.\n",
      "11. **Y929 (Unspecified place of occurrence):** The patient \"came to the ER,\" which is the place where the current medical event (presentation with headache and weakness) occurred. If a more specific location within the hospital is not given, 'unspecified' is appropriate.\n",

These findings suggest acute ischemic heart disease not classified as a full MI, such as unstable angina or re-ischemia.\n",
      "6.  **I501 (Left ventricular failure):** The patient's history includes \"sCHF (EF 45%)\" and the current presentation found him \"in heart failure with high blood pressure... with pulmonary edema,\" which signifies acute left ventricular failure.\n",
      "7.  **I5020 (Unspecified systolic (congestive) heart failure):** \"sCHF (EF 45%)\" refers to systolic congestive heart failure, and this code describes the chronic form of the patient's heart failure.\n",

      "11. **Z833 (Family history of diabetes mellitus):** While the HPI mentions the patient's own diabetes, a family history of diabetes is a common recorded patient history item, likely present in the complete medical record even if not detailed in this specific HPI excerpt.\n",
      "12. **Z8673 (Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebral infarction without residual deficits):** There is no direct mention of TIA or cerebral infarction in the provided medical record excerpt.

This constellation of symptoms (severe abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, chills/sweating) strongly indicates an acute flare-up of diverticulitis. The specific code K57.92 suggests a severe presentation, possibly complicated by perforation or abscess, which would align with the increasing severity of pain and systemic symptoms (chills/sweating), even if not explicitly stated as diagnosed in the HPI itself, it would be a plausible finding upon further workup or clinical suspicion for a severe episode.\n",

This clinical information supports **M40204 (Other specified kyphosis, thoracic region, unspecified)**, as kyphosis is a common spinal deformity requiring such fusions and extensions.\n",
      "2.  **Allergies: Numerous diabetes medications (Levemir, Lantus, Glucophage, novolin NPH, Novolog, Humulin N, Humalog, Januvia):** The extensive list of various insulins and oral antidiabetic agents strongly indicates a diagnosis of diabetes. Given the age and commonality, **E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)** is the most appropriate code, as no specific complications are mentioned in the limited record.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **E6601 (Morbid (severe) obesity due to excess calories):** While not explicitly stated, the presence of multiple chronic cardiovascular conditions (hypertension, heart failure, dyspnea) often correlates with and is exacerbated by morbid obesity. This is a common comorbidity in patients with extensive medication lists for such conditions.\n",
      "2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** Hyperlipidemia is a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure. Given the patient's extensive list of medications for cardiac conditions (e.g., Lisinopril, Irbesartan, Nifedipine, Atenolol), hyperlipidemia is a highly probable co-occurring condition.\n",
      "3.  **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** The patient's allergy list includes several medications used for pain management, specifically \"hydrocodone,\" \"Nsaids,\" and \"gabapentin.\" The use of these medications strongly suggests a history of chronic pain, which is further supported by the specific diagnosis of low back pain (M545).\n",
      "4.  **I083 (Combined mitral and tricuspid valve disorders):** The patient's history of long-standing hypertension (inferred from multiple antihypertensive medications) can lead to structural changes in the heart, including valvular heart disease and heart failure (I110, I5033). Combined valve disorders are a plausible complication in a patient with chronic, severe cardiac disease presenting with dyspnea and chest discomfort.\n",
      "5.  **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure):** The patient's allergy list contains multiple medications for hypertension, including \"Lisinopril,\" \"Irbesartan,\" \"Nifedipine,\" and \"Atenolol.\" The chief complaint of \"Dyspnea\" and \"chest discomfort,\" coupled with the presence of other heart failure codes (I5033), indicates heart failure that is attributed to long-standing hypertension.\n",
      "6.  **I482 (Permanent atrial fibrillation):** The patient's allergy list includes \"Coumadin,\" which is an anticoagulant commonly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent thromboembolic events such as strokes. This strongly indicates a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, and \"permanent\" denotes a chronic, established form.\n",
      "7.  **I4892 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation):** Similar to I482, the use of \"Coumadin\" provides strong evidence for a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. This code is used when the specific type of atrial fibrillation is not fully detailed or is carried over from previous records when the specific classification (e.g., permanent, paroxysmal) was not available.\n",
      "8.  **I5033 (Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure):** The chief complaint of \"Dyspnea\" and \"chest discomfort\" are classic symptoms of heart failure. Given the patient's history of hypertension (inferred from medications) and the related code I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure), this code specifies the type of heart failure as chronic diastolic.\n",
      "9.  **M545 (Low back pain):** The presence of pain medications like \"hydrocodone,\" \"Nsaids,\" and \"gabapentin\" in the allergy list indicates chronic pain. Low back pain is a very common specific source of chronic pain that would warrant these types of medications.\n",
      "10. **Z720 (Lack of physical exercise):** Given the likely morbid obesity (E6601), chronic pain (G8929, M545), and significant cardiovascular conditions causing dyspnea and heart failure, it is highly probable that the patient has a sedentary lifestyle due to these limiting factors.\n",

      "12. **I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure):** The patient has a history of \"HTN\" (Hypertension), and I5032 (Chronic diastolic heart failure, mild) is also coded, indicating hypertensive heart disease leading to heart failure.\n",
      "13. **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** The patient has a history of \"CAD\" (Coronary Artery Disease).\n",
      "14. **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** Not explicitly mentioned, but atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia in elderly patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease, and can contribute to confusion or encephalopathy.\n",
      "15. **I5032 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure, mild):** While not explicitly described as symptomatic heart failure in the HPI, given the patient's \"HTN\" and \"CAD,\" chronic diastolic heart failure is a very common comorbidity in this population and is consistent with the I110 code.\n",
      "16. **M00261 (Septic arthritis, right knee):** The history explicitly mentions \"recent admission for group G strep septic arthritis of his right knee (s/p washout)\" and \"increasing R knee effusion\" leading to re-admission.\n",

      "1.  **A084 (Viral intestinal infection, unspecified):** The patient \"developed what seemed to be 'stomach bug'\" with \"loose bowel movements, multiple times per day, associated with diffuse, crampy 'gas' pains,\" which \"lasted for about 1 week or so.\" This directly supports an acute viral intestinal infection.\n",
      "2.  **E785 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified):** The patient's Past Medical History (PMH) is \"notable for hyperlipidemia.\"\n",
      "3.  **E860 (Dehydration):** The patient \"was trying to keep up with PO intake as best she could, but does endorse eating less.\" She was noted to have \"low blood pressure\" and was later \"felt her to still be clinically dehydrated\" and \"received 500cc IVF.\"\n",
      "4.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified):** While not explicitly stated, patients experiencing acute severe symptoms like dyspnea and general illness often develop or exacerbate anxiety. This could be a pre-existing diagnosis or an acute clinical impression.\n",
      "5.  **H409 (Glaucoma, unspecified):** There is no information in the provided medical record to support this diagnosis. This may be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in the provided HPI summary.\n",
      "6.  **I129 (Hypertensive heart disease without heart failure, unspecified):** The patient has a PMH of \"hypertension.\" The initial PMH does not mention heart failure, so this code reflects the chronic hypertensive heart disease before the acute \"concern for new CHF.\"\n",
      "7.  **I161 (Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease):** This code combines hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure.\n",
      "    *   **Hypertension:** \"PMH notable for hypertension.\"\n",
      "    *   **Chronic Kidney Disease:** The presence of N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3) in the provided ICD-10 list indicates this is part of her PMH.\n",
      "    *   **Heart Failure:** During the acute presentation, there was \"worsening SOB associated with mild crackles in her lungs after receiving this fluid\" and \"elevated BNP, there was concern for new-onset CHF.\" This justifies the \"with heart failure\" component.\n",
      "8.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Given the patient's PMH of \"hypertension\" and \"hyperlipidemia,\" atherosclerotic heart disease is a common comorbidity and is likely part of her established medical history, even if not explicitly detailed in this acute HPI snippet.\n",
      "9.  **I480 (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation):** The patient's PMH is \"notable for pAF on Eliquis.\" This is a direct match.\n",
      "10. **J45909 (Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated):** The patient reported \"intermittently, she has had episodes of difficulty breathing, where she feels as if she is unable to catch her breath fully.\" While CHF is also a cause of dyspnea, the intermittent nature and lack of clear triggers could point to underlying asthma or reactive airway disease as a chronic condition.\n",
      "11. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** There are no specific symptoms of GERD mentioned in the HPI. This is a common chronic condition that could be part of the patient's medical history.\n",
      "12. **K589 (Irritable bowel syndrome, unspecified):** The patient's symptoms of \"diffuse, crampy 'gas' pains\" and \"loose bowel movements,\" both initially and recurrently, are consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which could be an underlying chronic condition or exacerbated by the acute illness.\n",
      "13. **K921 (Melena):** The patient \"began having worsening cramping associated with multiple loose BM's and one episode of bloody/jelly-like stool.\" This directly supports the diagnosis of melena.\n",
      "14. **M353 (Polymyalgia rheumatica):** There is no information in the provided medical record to support this diagnosis. This may be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in the provided HPI summary.\n",
      "15. **M810 (Osteoporosis with current pathological fracture):** There is no information in the provided medical record to support this diagnosis. This may be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in the provided HPI summary.\n",
      "16. **N183 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 3):** This code indicates a diagnosis of CKD stage 3. While not explicitly stated in the HPI's brief PMH, its presence in the provided ICD-10 list means it is part of the patient's comprehensive medical history. This code is crucial for supporting I161.\n",
      "17. **Z66 (Do not resuscitate order [DNR]):** There is no information in the provided medical record regarding the patient's code status. This may be part of the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in the provided HPI summary.\n",
      "18. **Z7902 (Long term (current) use of oral anticoagulant):** The patient's PMH includes \"pAF on Eliquis.\" Eliquis is an oral anticoagulant, directly supporting this code.\n",

      "9.  **E872 (Acidosis):** Acidosis can occur in severely ill patients, especially those with sepsis, acute kidney injury, or poorly controlled diabetes (even if hypoglycemia is present, other forms of acidosis can develop).\n",
      "10. **G629 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified):** The patient reports \"Joint weakness and difficulty walking\" and \"Chronic double vision.\" These symptoms are consistent with polyneuropathy, which is a common complication of long-standing diabetes.\n",
      "11. **I5033 (Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure):** The patient has \"HTN\" and \"CKD\" as risk factors. Symptoms like \"SOB\" and \"chest pain worse with coughing and walking, present at rest as well\" are consistent with heart failure. The \"acute on chronic\" implies a worsening of pre-existing heart failure due to the acute illness.\n",
      "12. **N400 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms):** The patient is male. BPH is a very common condition in older men and often included in medical records even if not the primary acute issue.\n",

      "1.  **D72829 (Other specified abnormal white blood cells, unspecified):** The medical record does not contain explicit information regarding abnormal white blood cell findings or any condition that would directly lead to this code. This code might have been assigned based on laboratory results or a broader medical history not detailed in the provided text.\n",
      "2.  **E1110 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis without coma):** The chief complaint is \"DKA\" and the patient's past medical history (PMH) includes \"IDDM w/ recurrent DKA.\" The patient was found to be in DKA in the ED. While \"IDDM\" typically refers to Type 1 diabetes, the assigned E11.10 code indicates Type 2 diabetes with ketoacidosis, implying the patient's insulin-dependent diabetes is classified as Type 2.\n",
      "3.  **E1143 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy):** The patient has a history of diabetes (\"IDDM\") and describes \"worsened L sided low back pain past few days, tearing sensation, radiating down leg.\" While spinal issues are noted, diabetic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause radiating pain and neurological symptoms, justifying this code in the context of Type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "4.  **F1911 (Other psychoactive substance abuse, unspecified, without complicating conditions):** The patient's PMH includes \"prior domestic abuse/sexual trauma\" and notes \"poor medication compliance\" for insulin. Although the patient denies cocaine use, a history of trauma is a known risk factor for substance abuse. This code could have been assigned based on a more comprehensive psychosocial history or an assessment of behavioral patterns related to \"poor medication compliance,\" even if not explicitly detailed in the HPI.\n",
      "5.  **F418 (Other specified anxiety disorders):** The patient's PMH lists \"anxiety,\" and she \"Got lorazepam for anxiety\" in the ED. This directly supports the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.\n",
      "6.  **K209 (Esophagitis, unspecified):** The ED findings explicitly state \"evidence of esophagitis.\" This directly supports the code.\n",
      "7.  **K3184 (Gastroparesis):** The patient's PMH includes \"gastroparesis.\" This directly supports the code.\n",
      "8.  **M5489 (Other dorsalgia):** The patient presented with \"back pain,\" has \"chronic back pain for ___ years,\" and describes \"worsened L sided low back pain past few days, tearing sensation, radiating down leg\" after previous spinal surgeries. This code covers various forms of back pain not specified elsewhere, fitting her chronic and acute symptoms.\n",
      "9.  **R12 (Heartburn):** The patient reported \"intermittent cp, occurring every few minutes, sharp, radiating to her back,\" and the ED found \"evidence of esophagitis.\" These symptoms are highly characteristic of heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n",
      "10. **Z720 (Problems related to lifestyle, Tobacco use):** The provided medical record does not contain any information regarding the patient's tobacco use. This code might have been assigned based on a more comprehensive social history not included in this excerpt.\n",
      "11. **Z794 (Long term (current) use of insulin):** The patient's PMH is \"IDDM w/ recurrent DKA\" and she \"denies missing any insulin doses recently,\" indicating she is currently on insulin therapy for her diabetes. This directly supports the long-term use of insulin.\n",
      "12. **Z833 (Family history of diabetes mellitus):** The provided medical record does not contain any information about the patient's family history of diabetes mellitus. This code might have been assigned based on a more comprehensive family history taking not included in this excerpt.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **D419 (Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of unspecified site):** The medical record states \"Placement of right subclavian port today for access.\" While the HPI doesn't explicitly mention a neoplasm, central venous ports are frequently placed for long-term access in patients with known or suspected cancer, often for chemotherapy. In the absence of another specified reason for a port that fits this diagnosis, it suggests an underlying or suspected neoplasm, even if its behavior is uncertain and site unspecified in this narrative.\n",
      "2.  **D509 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified):** The provided medical record does not contain any direct information (e.g., laboratory results, specific symptoms attributed to anemia, or a history of anemia) to infer the presence of iron deficiency anemia.\n",
      "3.  **D6851 (Factor V Leiden mutation):** The history explicitly states, \"Factor V leiden with prior DVT on warfarin.\" This directly supports the diagnosis of Factor V Leiden mutation.\n",
      "4.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** This code is assigned based on a patient's Body Mass Index (BMI). The code Z6841 (Body mass index [BMI] 40.0-44.9, adult) is also assigned, which indicates severe obesity and directly supports the general diagnosis of obesity.\n",
      "5.  **J398 (Other specified diseases of upper respiratory tract):** The history mentions \"tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheobronchoplasty.\" Tracheobronchomalacia is a structural abnormality of the trachea and bronchi, which falls under the category of \"other specified diseases of upper respiratory tract.\"\n",
      "6.  **J449 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified):** The patient has a complex history of chronic respiratory issues including \"chronic bronchiolitis\" and \"severe refractory asthma.\" Chronic bronchiolitis can be a component of or lead to COPD. While severe asthma (J45998) is explicitly mentioned, COPD is a common co-morbidity in patients with long-standing, severe airway disease.\n",
      "7.  **J45998 (Severe persistent asthma with acute exacerbation, unspecified):** The history explicitly states \"history of severe refractory asthma.\" The chief complaint of \"Dyspnea\" and the description of \"post-op had subjective respiratory distress\" with increased respiratory rate indicate an acute exacerbation of her asthma.\n",
      "8.  **J679 (Hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to unspecified organic dust or agent):** The history explicitly mentions \"chronic bronchiolitis/hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\" This directly supports the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n",
      "9.  **J9809 (Other diseases of bronchus and lung):** The history mentions \"chronic bronchiolitis.\" This condition, characterized by chronic inflammation of the small airways, can be classified under \"Other diseases of bronchus and lung.\"\n",
      "10. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** The patient reports \"dizziness/presyncopal feeling with cough which is chronic, and has been progressing.\" Chronic cough is a well-known extra-esophageal manifestation of Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). Although GERD is not explicitly stated, the chronic cough symptom strongly suggests its presence.\n",
      "11. **R0902 (Hypoxemia):** The chief complaint is \"Dyspnea.\" Later in the HPI, it is noted, \"In the ___, O2 sats low ___ on room air, breathing comfortably.\" Low oxygen saturation (O2 sats) directly indicates hypoxemia.\n",
      "12. **R110 (Nausea with vomiting, unspecified):** The patient explicitly \"Denies nausea/vomiting\" in the HPI. Therefore, based on the provided text, this code is not supported and is contradicted by the patient's report.\n",
      "13. **Z6841 (Body mass index [BMI] 40.0-44.9, adult):** The medical record does not explicitly state the patient's BMI or describe her body habitus. However, if this code is assigned, it indicates that the patient's BMI was measured and falls within the range of 40.0-44.9, which is classified as severe obesity.\n",
      "14. **Z7901 (Long term (current) use of agents affecting estrogen receptors and estrogen levels):** The provided medical record does not contain any information about the patient's use of agents affecting estrogen receptors or estrogen levels, nor any history that would necessitate such medication.\n",
      "15. **Z7902 (Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants):** The history states, \"Factor V leiden with prior DVT on warfarin.\" Warfarin is an anticoagulant, directly supporting this code.\n",
      "16. **Z86718 (Personal history of other venous thromboembolism):** The history explicitly mentions \"prior DVT\" (Deep Vein Thrombosis). DVT is a form of venous thromboembolism, justifying a personal history code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient's ICD-10 codes reflect a complex medical history dominated by severe chronic respiratory conditions (asthma, bronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, tracheobronchomalacia, COPD) with an acute exacerbation, a hypercoagulable state (Factor V Leiden with prior DVT), and various comorbidities or findings such as chronic cough likely due to GERD, and post-operative hypoxemia. Some codes (D419, E669, Z6841) are inferred based on common clinical associations or the presence of related codes, while others (D509, R110, Z7901) are either unsupported or contradicted by the provided HPI narrative.\n",

      "<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1.  **F17210 (Nicotine dependence, uncomplicated, in remission)**: The patient has a \"history of IV drug use (per patient only did IV drug use once in setting of suicide attempt 3 months ago).\" While this code specifically refers to nicotine dependence, which is not explicitly stated, it is common for individuals with a history of other substance use disorders and mental health conditions (like depression and a suicide attempt) to also have a history of nicotine dependence. Therefore, this code likely reflects a broader history of substance use, including nicotine, even if not detailed in this specific HPI.\n",
      "2.  **F329 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)**: The medical record explicitly states the patient has a \"past medical history of depression.\" This directly supports the assignment of this code.\n",
      "3.  **F419 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified)**: The patient's complex psychiatric history, including depression and a suicide attempt, as well as the acute and concerning neurological symptoms (sudden inability to move arm, concern for plexopathy), would reasonably induce anxiety. Anxiety disorders are frequently comorbid with depression and can be inferred from the overall clinical picture.\n",
      "4.  **M25512 (Pain in left shoulder)**: The patient reports \"numbness in the left arm starting at the dorsum of the hand all the way up to the shoulder\" and \"inability to abduct left arm.\" Although she denies \"any associated pain no neck or shoulder pain\" for the acute presentation, the underlying condition causing the numbness and motor deficit (plexopathy) can be associated with discomfort, dysesthesia, or neuropathic pain, which might be coded as pain in a broader sense, or it could be a code reflecting a chronic or intermittent issue not fully detailed in this acute presentation.\n",
      "5.  **M25812 (Other specified joint disorders, left shoulder)**: The chief complaint is \"inability to abduct left arm\" and the HPI notes the patient is \"unable to move her left beyond 30°,\" with \"concern for plexopathy.\" Plexopathy affects the nerves controlling the shoulder and arm, leading to functional impairment of the shoulder joint. This functional limitation of the joint due to nerve involvement can be classified as an \"other specified joint disorder.\"\n",
      "6.  **M6281 (Muscle weakness (generalized))**: The patient's inability to abduct her left arm and inability to move it beyond 30° clearly indicate muscle weakness in the left arm. While the code specifies \"generalized muscle weakness\" and the patient's weakness is localized to the left arm, this code is sometimes used to denote significant muscle weakness when a more specific localized code is not available or preferred in a given coding system.\n",

      "2.  **E10319 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy with macular edema, not specified as to type):** The patient has a \"h/o DM1.\" The inclusion of this specific code indicates that diabetic retinopathy with macular edema is a documented, existing complication of her Type 1 Diabetes from her comprehensive medical record.\n",
      "3.  **E1040 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified):** The patient has a \"h/o DM1.\" This code indicates a documented history of unspecified diabetic neuropathy, a common long-term complication of Type 1 Diabetes.\n",
      "4.  **E1043 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy):** The patient has a \"h/o DM1.\" This code specifies a documented history of diabetic polyneuropathy, another common neurological complication of Type 1 Diabetes.\n",
      "5.  **E10649 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic arthropathy, unspecified):** The patient has a \"h/o DM1.\" This code indicates a documented history of diabetic arthropathy, a musculoskeletal complication of Type 1 Diabetes.\n",
      "6.  **E1065 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus with other bone complications):** The patient has a \"h/o DM1.\" This code indicates a documented history of other bone complications related to Type 1 Diabetes.\n",
      "7.  **E440 (Moderate protein-calorie malnutrition):** The HPI mentions \"decreased PO intake for past couple of days\" and \"difficulty taking her medications due to nausea.\" Combined with chronic illness (CHF, DM, post-gastric bypass state), this suggests a state of malnutrition.\n",
      "8.  **E559 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified):** \"Decreased PO intake\" and the history of \"roux-en-y gastric bypass\" increase the risk for malabsorption and nutrient deficiencies, including Vitamin D.\n",
      "9.  **E669 (Obesity, unspecified):** The history of \"roux-en-y gastric bypass\" indicates that the patient underwent this procedure for the treatment of obesity, hence a history of obesity.\n",
      "10. **G8929 (Other chronic pain):** The HPI mentions a \"fall after standing up after sleeping.\" While specific chronic pain from this fall is not explicitly detailed, G8929 (Other chronic pain) would be used for any documented chronic pain condition not otherwise specified, which could arise from the fall or other chronic conditions/procedures.\n",
      "11. **I509 (Heart failure, unspecified):** Directly corresponds to \"h/o CHF\" (Congestive Heart Failure).\n",
      "12. **I739 (Peripheral vascular disease, unspecified):** This is a common comorbidity, especially in patients with long-standing diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, and is likely documented in the full history.\n",
      "13. **K284 (Acute gastric ulcer with hemorrhage):** The chief complaint is \"Gastric ulcer,\" and the patient presented with \"hematemesis and melena\" (hemorrhage) as a complication, strongly supporting this diagnosis. The mention of \"s/p vagotomy\" also suggests previous ulcer-related issues.\n",
      "14. **K3184 (Gastric intestinal metaplasia):** This is a precancerous condition often found during an EGD. While not in the HPI, its presence in the ICD-10 list implies it was found during diagnostic procedures (EGD mentioned) or in prior medical records.\n",
      "15. **K5900 (Constipation, unspecified):** \"Decreased PO intake\" and certain medications can lead to constipation. While not explicitly stated, it's a common issue in hospitalized patients or those with complex medical histories.\n",
      "16. **M25511 (Pain in right shoulder, unspecified):** This could be an additional documented issue from the fall or unrelated, found in the complete medical record. The HPI mentions a \"fall after standing up after sleeping.\"\n",
      "17. **T85698A (Other mechanical complication of other specified internal prosthetic devices, implants and grafts, initial encounter):** The \"roux-en-y gastric bypass\" is a surgical modification of the gastrointestinal tract, which can be broadly considered as involving \"internal prosthetic devices, implants and grafts.\" The \"n/v hematemesis and melena\" along with the \"acute gastric ulcer with hemorrhage\" are mechanical complications directly stemming from this bypass surgery. \"Initial encounter\" (A) signifies that this is the first time the patient is receiving active treatment for this specific complication during this admission.\n",
      "18. **Y848 (Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure):** This external cause code explicitly links a medical procedure (the roux-en-y gastric bypass) to the subsequent complication (T85.698A - mechanical complication leading to ulcer with hemorrhage), without implying an error during the initial surgery.\n",
      "19. **Y92239 (Nursing home as the place of occurrence of the external cause):** The HPI states the patient \"had a fall after standing up after sleeping.\" While the HPI doesn't explicitly name a \"nursing home,\" the presence of this specific code implies that the fall *did* occur in a nursing home, as documented elsewhere in the full medical record.\n",
      "20. **Z6831 (Body mass index (BMI) 30.0-30.9, adult):** The patient underwent \"roux-en-y gastric bypass\" due to prior obesity. While the HPI doesn't state her current BMI, this code indicates her current or recent BMI was in the 30.0-30.9 range, which is still considered obese, suggesting some weight loss post-bypass but perhaps not to a non-obese range.\n",
      "21. **Z9884 (Bariatric surgery status):** Directly corresponds to the \"roux-en-y gastric bypass\" mentioned in the HPI, indicating the patient's post-surgical status.\n",

      "Summary: This patient is a female with a history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with multiple documented complications, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. She underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity and a vagotomy. She presented with acute gastrointestinal bleeding due to an acute gastric ulcer with hemorrhage, identified as a mechanical complication of her gastric bypass, leading to iron deficiency anemia. She also experiences moderate protein-calorie malnutrition and Vitamin D deficiency, likely exacerbated by nausea and decreased oral intake. Other active issues include chronic pain, gastric intestinal metaplasia, and a recent fall that occurred in a nursing home.\n",

      "7.  **I248 (Other forms of acute ischemic heart disease):** While \"CAD\" (Coronary Artery Disease) is chronic, the acute presentation with \"altered mental status,\" \"short of breath,\" and \"coughing\" in an elderly patient could indicate an acute cardiac event or decompensation of her CAD, leading to this code.\n",
      "8.  **I2510 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris):** Directly corresponds to \"CAD\" (Coronary Artery Disease) in the patient's medical history. The \"without angina pectoris\" specifies that the patient is not presenting with chest pain, which is consistent with the HPI.\n",
      "9.  **I272 (Other secondary pulmonary hypertension):** Given the patient's history of \"HFpEF\" (Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction) and \"chronic pericardial effusion,\" along with reported \"short of breath,\" secondary pulmonary hypertension is a common comorbidity.\n",
      "10. **I471 (Supraventricular tachycardia):** Directly corresponds to \"SVT\" (Supraventricular Tachycardia) in the patient's medical history.\n",
      "11. **I5033 (Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure):** Directly corresponds to \"HFpEF\" (Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction) in the patient's medical history, as HFpEF is a form of diastolic heart failure, and \"chronic\" is implied by it being in the history.\n",
      "12. **J3489 (Other specified disorders of nose and nasal sinuses):** This specific diagnosis is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is likely a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this HPI summary.\n",
      "13. **K219 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis):** Corresponds to the patient's report of \"burning\" abdominal pain that was constant and non-radiating, a classic symptom of GERD.\n",
      "14. **M1A9XX0 (Other chronic gout, unspecified site):** This specific diagnosis is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is likely a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this HPI summary.\n",
      "15. **N184 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 (moderate to severe)):** Directly corresponds to \"CKD 4\" in the patient's medical history. The lab finding of Cr 1.4 (baseline 1.1) supports ongoing kidney dysfunction, though the stage is based on the history.\n",
      "16. **Z85118 (Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung):** This specific diagnosis is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is likely a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this HPI summary.\n",
      "17. **Z853 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast):** This specific diagnosis is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is likely a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this HPI summary.\n",
      "18. **Z87891 (Personal history of nicotine dependence):** This specific history is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is a common comorbidity for patients with extensive cardiac and pulmonary history and is likely from the patient's comprehensive medical history.\n",
      "19. **Z9114 (Patient's noncompliance with medication regimen due to financial hardship):** This specific factor is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. While altered mental status could lead to non-compliance, financial hardship is not specified. It is likely from the patient's comprehensive medical history.\n",
      "20. **Z96643 (Presence of left hip prosthesis):** This specific device is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is likely a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this HPI summary.\n",
      "21. **Z96653 (Presence of right hip prosthesis):** This specific device is not directly mentioned in the provided medical record. It is likely a pre-existing condition from the patient's comprehensive medical history not detailed in this HPI summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The patient's ICD-10 codes reflect a complex medical history including hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, multiple cardiac conditions (SVT, HTN, CAD, HFpEF, chronic pericardial effusion, possible acute ischemic event, secondary pulmonary hypertension), chronic kidney disease stage 4, and gastro-esophageal reflux disease. The acute presentation of altered mental status is coded as toxic encephalopathy. Several codes (I080, J3489, M1A9XX0, Z85118, Z853, Z87891, Z9114, Z96643, Z96653) are not directly supported by the provided HPI but are presumed to be part of the patient's broader medical history.\n",
